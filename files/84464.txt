Radiofrequency Ablation of Malignant Pulmonary Nodules
The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of patients with malignant pulmonary nodules（not exceed 3cm ）who are not suitable candidates for or refuse surgical resection.
Neoplasms|Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation
1- , 3- and 5-year survival rates, up to 5 years after the procedures|complication rate, Including puncture-related complications such as pulmonary haemorrhage, hemothorax, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and air embolism and ablation-related complications such as chest pain, pleural reactions, cough, and skin burns., During the procedure or up to 5 years after the procedures
changes of the size about the tumor on CT/MRI images, Changes in imaging findings in the ablation zone, After the procedures up to three months
Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique widely used to treat solid tumors. Patients with malignant pulmonary nodules will undergo a series of CT- guided percutaneous RFA procedures. During the procedures，percutaneous needles will be inserted into the target tissues under CT guidance，the needles deliver thermal energy and then destroy the tumors by causing coagulation necrosis via tissue heating. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of RFA in pulmonary nodules （maximum tumor diameter ≦30 mm） was 10 mm apart from the big trachea, primary bronchi, esophagus, great vessels，heart and pleura. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations，including recent laboratory tests evaluated and imaging studies reviewed，will be performed both before and after the procedures.
