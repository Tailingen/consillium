99mTc/68Ga Labeled Anti-PD-L1 sdAb in Assessment of PD-L1 Expression in NSCLC
To evaluate the safety, dosimetry and efficacy of 99mTc/68Ga labeled anti-PD-L1 single domian antibody (sdAb) (Product Code Name: 99mTc-NM-01 and 68Ga-NM-01) in the diagnostic imaging PD-L1 expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and compare it with the existing gold standard "biopsy PD-L1 detection". It is also to establish a new clinical method of non-invasive PD-L1 expression detection in NSCLC using 99mTc/68Ga labeled anti-PD-L1 sdAb.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Injection of 99mTc-NM-01|PROCEDURE: Injection of 68Ga-NM-01
Visual Assessment of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC using 99mTc-NM-01 SPECT/CT and 68Ga-NM-01 PET/CT Scan, Visual analysis will be carried out by 4 experienced nuclear medicine physicians to observe the uptake of 99mTc-NM-01 and 68Ga-NM-01 in lung lesions. A 4 point system will be used to interpret the scans for abnormalities. It is categorised as such: score 0, no abnormal increased uptake; score 1, low increased uptake; score 2, moderate increased uptake; score 3, high increased uptake. The lesion will be considered positive for malignancy if the score is 2 or higher., 1 year|Semiquantitative Assessment of Lung Lesions in 99mTc-NM-01 SPECT/CT and 68Ga-NM-01 PET Scan, Patients in the 99mTc-NM-01 group will be administered 3-12 MBq/kg of 99mTc-NM-01 and patients in the 68Ga-NM-01 group will be administered 0.75-4 MBq/kg of 68Ga-NM-01. The semiquantitative analysis of the region of interest (ROI) will be performed in lung lesions. Higher level of PD-L1 expression (Tumor proportion score, TPS), higher ROI in tumor. No expression TPS \< 1%; Low expression TPS 1 - 49%; High expression TPS â‰¥ 50%., 1 year
PD-L1 expression levels, Patients biopsy sample will be tested to confirm the levels of PD-L1 expression using Human PD-L1 ELISA Kit., 1 year|Adverse Drug Reaction Report, Monitor adverse events within 7 days after the injection and scanning to establish the safety of 99mTc-NM-01 and 68Ga-NM-01 in patients., 7 days|New tumor lesion detection, 99mTc-NM-01 SPECT/CT and 68Ga-NM-01 PET/CT may detect new tumor areas, which can be further proven by biopsy method in order to rule out any false positive results., 1 year
