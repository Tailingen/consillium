Head and Neck Melanoma; Access to Staging and Surgical Treatment
Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer and is the 5th most common cancer in the United Kingdom (UK). It can affect anywhere on the skin including on the head and neck. The cancer often is first noticed as an abnormal mole. Treatment is by removing the cancer with surgery. Early spread of the cancer can be found by testing nearby glands called lymph nodes. This operation is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). If the cancer has spread then new treatments, such as immunotherapy, can be given to help the person live for longer.

The sentinel lymph nodes are usually in the armpits or groin for melanoma on the body, arms or legs. For cancers in the head and neck the sentinel lymph nodes will usually be in the neck. For several reasons SLNB in the neck is not offered in every hospital that manages patients with melanoma. The problem with this is that some patients who could benefit are not offered the new treatments that extend life because it is not known that their cancer has spread.

In this study we aim to gather national data on the management of melanoma of the head and neck including variation in practice between different hospitals. We will use routinely collected anonymous data called 'Hospital Episode Statistics' to look at who is offered SLNB after melanoma of the head or neck, what treatments they have, if their melanoma comes back and how long they survive for.

By doing this, we hope to identify whether SLNB should be made available to everyone diagnosed with melanoma of the head and neck.

1. What proportion of patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck go on to have SLNB?, 5 years|2. How does this compare to the proportion of patients with cutaneous melanoma in other parts of the body that go on to have SLNB?, 5 years

Do a higher proportion of patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck who have had an SLNB have systemic anti-cancer therapies (or other treatments) for comparable T stage?, 5 years|3. Is there a variation in provision of SLNB for cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck across England?, 5 years
