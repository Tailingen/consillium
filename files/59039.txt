Molecular Profile-related Individualized Targeted Therapy in Resected Pancreatic Cancer With High-Risk of Cancer Recurrence
This is a prospective, open-label therapeutic interventional investigation designed to interrogate the efficacy and safety of individualized matched therapies in patients with pancreatic cancer at high risk of disease recurrence post-surgery.
Pancreas Cancer
OTHER: Treatment Plan
Disease-free Survival, The number of subjects exhibiting disease-free survival at six months. Disease-free survival is defined as the time from study therapy initiation until disease recurrence or death from any cause., Six months|Adverse Events, The number of clinically relevant Grade 3 to 4 adverse events and serious adverse events that are at least possibly related to the study therapy per investigator assessment., Up to 12 months
This is a prospective, open-label, therapeutic interventional investigation designed to interrogate the efficacy and safety of personalized matched therapy in pancreatic cancer patients who have completed all intended multimodal therapy, including resection of the pancreatic cancer tumor. Potential participants must have their tumor tissue or blood molecularly profiled with the results discussed by the Molecular Tumor Board, whether convened in person, virtually (e.g., WebEx), or in an electronic forum (e.g., email). Only those patients who agree to receive the Molecular Tumor Board-recommended matched therapy (i.e., study treatment) will be eligible and enrolled on the study.
