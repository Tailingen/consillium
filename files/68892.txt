KZR-261 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies
A first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of KZR-261 designed to assess the safety and tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KZR-261, as well as identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study comprises a Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and a Part 2 (Dose Expansion) in solid organ tumors (melanoma/uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and "All-Tumors").
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: KZR-261
Number and percentage of participants experiencing adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 (Part 1 & 2), Incidence and percentage of adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected from start of enrollment, Approximately 20 months|Number and percentage of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 (Part 1), Incidence and percentage of dose-limiting toxicities will be collected from start of enrollment, Approximately 20 months|Maximum plasma concentration of KZR-261 (Part 1), Summary of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed, Approximately 20 months|The plasma concentration time curve of KZR-261 (Part 1), Summary of the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) will be assessed, Approximately 20 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of KZR-261, Defined as the rate of partial responses (PRs) plus complete responses (CRs) according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately 20 months|Duration of response (DOR) of KZR-261, Duration of overall response (partial response and complete response), Approximately 20 months|Progression-free Survival of Patients treated with KZR-261, Time to disease progression, Approximately 20 months|Overall Survival of Patients treated with KZR-261, Time of overall survival, Approximately 20 months
The first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of KZR-261, Study KZR-261-101, will be conducted in two parts (dose escalation and dose expansion) to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of KZR-261 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies for whom no therapeutics are available that can confer a reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit. The 5 tumor cohorts in the dose expansion part include advanced malignant:

* melanoma/uveal melanoma
* mesothelioma
* colorectal cancer
* castrate-resistant prostate cancer
* "All-Tumors"

Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion) comprise a 4-week Screening Period, a Treatment Period lasting approximately 24 weeks, 4-6-week Safety Follow-up, and a 12-month Long-Term Follow-up Period (after last dose of study treatment), for a total study duration of approximately 20 months.
