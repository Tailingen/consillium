Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma With a Hypermutator Phenotype
The purpose of this study is to test if the study drug called pembrolizumab could control the growth or shrink the cancer but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will shrink the cancer by half, or prevent it from growing for at least 6 months. Pembrolizumab is an antibody that targets the immune system and activates it to stop cancer growth and/or kill cancer cells.

response rate, patients with stable disease will be considered responders if disease is stable for 27 weeks or more. The regimen will be considered worthy of further study if responses as defined above are observed in at least 3 of the 12 subjects. All subjects will undergo DCE-MRI of the head at the time points specified in Study Flow Chart . Local radiologic assessment of tumor measurements will be used during the study for clinical management and investigator-assessed disease progression. Additional MRIs may be obtained at the discretion of the investigators, as clinically indicated. Radiologic response (complete response or partial response) will be assessed by comparing on-treatment MRI scans with the pretreatment baseline MRI scans. Radiologic progression will be determined by using the smallest tumor measurement of either the pretreatment baseline or after initiation of study medication. The RANO criteria will be used for determining disease status., 1 year
