An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study to Test Combination Treatments in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab, in combination with other therapies, is effective in patients with advanced Non-Small Cell lung cancer
Advanced Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|DRUG: Dasatinib|BIOLOGICAL: Relatlimab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|DRUG: BMS-986205
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response (BOR) is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). BOR was assessed by investigator per RECIST1.1.

Results are presented by study track. Track 1 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 positive Track 2 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 negative Track 3 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy Track 4 = participants naive for prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3) Track 5 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3).

Results for each study track are presented only for treatment groups who received a treatment in that specific track., From first dose to 2 years following last dose (up to 30 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, computed for all treated participants with a confirmed BOR of CR or PR, is defined as the time between the date of first response and the date of first documented disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause.

Results are presented by study track. Track 1 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 positive Track 2 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 negative Track 3 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy Track 4 = participants naive for prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3) Track 5 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3).

Results for each study track are presented only for treatment groups who received a treatment in that specific track., From first dose to 2 years following last dose (up to 30 months)|Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR) at 24 Weeks, The PFSR at 24 weeks is defined as the proportion of treated participants remaining progression free and surviving at 24 weeks since the first dosing date.

Results are presented by study track. Track 1 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 positive (\>=1%) Track 2 = participants naive for prior immuno-oncology (IO) therapy and PD-L1 negative (\<1%) Track 3 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy Track 4 = participants naive for prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3) Track 5 = participants with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (established upon enrollment closure of tracks 1,2 and 3).

Results for each study track are presented only for treatment groups who received a treatment in that specific track., From first dose to 24 weeks after first dose
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), This outcome measure describes the percentage of participants who experienced any grade, all causality AEs during the specified time frame, From first dose to 100 days following last dose|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), This outcome measure describes the percentage of participants who experienced any grade, all causality SAEs during the specified time frame, From first dose to 100 days following last dose|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, This outcome measure describes the percentage of participants who experienced all causality AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy during the specified time frame, From first dose to 100 days following last dose|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Death, This outcome measure describes the percentage of participants who died (due to any cause) during the specified time frame, From first dose to up to 45 months following first dose|Number of Participants Experiencing Laboratory Abnormalities in Hepatic Tests, The following measurements will be considered laboratory abnormalities for hepatic tests:

* ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN, \> 5 x ULN, \> 10 x ULN and \> 20 x ULN
* Total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Concurrent (within 1 day) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Concurrent (within 30 days) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN ALT=Alanine aminotransferase AST=Aspartate aminotransferase ULN=Upper Limit of Normal, From first dose to 100 days following last dose (approximately 9 months)|Number of Participants Experiencing Laboratory Abnormalities in Thyroid Tests, The following measurements will be considered laboratory abnormalities for thyroid tests:

* TSH value \> ULN and
* With baseline TSH value ≤ ULN
* At least one T3/T4 test value \< LLN
* Low TSH \< LLN and
* With baseline TSH value ≥ LLN
* At least one T3/T4 test value \> ULN TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone ULN=Upper Limit of Normal LLN=Lower Limit of Normal T3=Triiodothyronine T4=Thyroxine, From first dose to 100 days following last dose (approximately 9 months)
