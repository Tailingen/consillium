Management of Insomnia in Breast Cancer Patients
To provide preliminary data on the effects of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBT-I) on insomnia in breast cancer patients expecting to receive cancer treatment (unspecified).

Participants will be randomized into 4 groups:

* Arm 1: Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (BBT-I) + Armodafinil 150 mg/day.
* Arm 2: Behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) + Armodafinil 150 mg/day.
* Arm 3: Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (BBT-I) without pharmaceutical intervention.
* Arm 4: Behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) without pharmaceutical intervention.

Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) survey questionnaire is a 7-question survey, with each question having 5 possible answers (none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of ISI scores is from 0 to 28. Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater insomnia. Clinical interpretation is as follows.

* 0 to 7 No clinically significant insomnia
* 8 to14 Subthreshold insomnia
* 15 to 21 Clinical insomnia (moderate severity)
* 22 to 28 Clinical insomnia (severe)

ISI survey was conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 32 weeks. The outcome is reported as the mean ISI score with standard deviation., up to 32 Weeks
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) survey questionnaire is a 13-question subset of the 41-question Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire, with each question having 5 possible answers (not at all; a little bit; somewhat; quite a bit; very much), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of FACIT-Fatigue scores is from 0 to 52. Higher scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly lower scores are considered to indicate greater fatigue.

The FACIT-Fatigue survey was conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 32 weeks. The outcome is reported as the mean with standard deviation., up to 32 Weeks
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), The full Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) survey questionnaire is a 41-question survey, with each question having 5 possible answers (not at all; a little bit; somewhat; quite a bit; very much), scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. The full range of scores is from 0 to 164. Higher scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly lower scores are considered to indicate greater fatigue.

The FACIT-F survey was conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 32 weeks. The outcome is reported as the mean with standard deviation., up to 32 Weeks|Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) survey questionnaire is a 9-question survey, with each question having 11 possible answers ("No fatigue" to "As bad as you can imagine"), scored from 0 to 10, with each patient's overall BFI score being the mean of the values from each question (overall range 0 to 10). Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater fatigue.

The BFI survey was conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 32 weeks. The outcome is reported as the mean of the overall BFI scores with standard deviation., up to 32 Weeks
The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia (BBT-I) in the treatment of insomnia in humans.

Insomnia is an extraordinarily common problem for cancer patients that is often associated with diminished social and vocational functioning and QOL. It is also likely that insomnia exacerbates other cancer-related symptoms (eg, fatigue, nausea, depressive mood, pain and/or reduced pain tolerance) and thus gives rise to the possibility of additive or multiplicative interactions. It is possible that untreated insomnia in the context of cancer therapy may lead to chronic forms of insomnia in cancer survivors which, in turn, independently confers risk for increased psychiatric and medical morbidity.

Thus, insomnia, by itself, is a significant problem that requires better understanding in order that its high prevalence can be reduced.

Developing interventions that might prevent onset of insomnia in breast cancer patients is vital.
