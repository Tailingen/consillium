Parenchymal Sparing Hepatectomy in Post-chemotherapy Liver Atrophy
Major hepatectomy in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) and post-chemotherapy liver atrophy is associated with increased complications. Whether the performance of parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy (PSH) in those patients can be safer is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical impact of post-chemotherapy liver atrophy on patients undergoing PSH for CLM. For this purpose, the occurrence of liver atrophy was recorded and then computed against the occurrence of postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Colorectal Cancer Stage IV
PROCEDURE: Hepatectomy
Postoperative complications, Any adverse event after surgery, From the date of surgery up to 90 days
Patients affected by CLMs and trated with neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy and then hepatectomy were reviewed with the intent to assess the occurrence of liver atrophy, which is a sign of liver dysfunction and a source of morbidity expecially in patients treated with major or extended hepatectomy. Whether the performance of parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy (PSH) in those patients can be safer is unknown. Then, we planned to review our cases with the above mentioned endpoint.
