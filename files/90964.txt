Phase 2 Trial of Regorafenib in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal and Fallopian Tube Cancer
This will be a non-blinded, single arm study to test the efficacy of Regorafenib in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: regorafenib
6 Month Progression Free Survival (PFS), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of Regorafenib as measured by progression free survival at 6 months in patients with recurrent gynecological cancers, Patients will be checked for PFS after 6 months on treatment|Incidence of Adverse Events (Grade 2 or Higher), Assessed According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of Regorafenib in this cohort of patients. Toxicity will be summarized by attribution: regorafenib-related adverse events grade 2 or higher will be reported., Patients will remain on treatment for approximately 4-6 months on average.
Estimate Progression Free Survival, To estimate progression free survival for patients treated with this regimen, At 6 months patients will be checked for PFS, and compared to the expected probability of the patient being alive and progression-free for at least 6 months|Frequency of Clinical Benefit (Stable Disease, Partial and Complete Response), To determine the frequency of clinical benefit (stable disease, partial, and complete response) according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria, Scans will be done every 2 cycles (every 2 months) for disease assessment. Patients on average will be on treatment for 4-6 months
This will be a non-blinded, single arm study to test the efficacy of Regorafenib in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.
