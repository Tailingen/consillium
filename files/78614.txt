QUILT-3.018: Neukoplast™ (NK-92) for the Treatment of Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
NK cells from patients with malignant diseases are often functionally impaired. Their function cannot be fully restored through ex vivo expansion and cytokine activation. In addition, the in vivo administration of cytokines not only expands NK cells but expands polyclonal T cells with no tumor specificity and no known effects.

The utilization of Neukoplast™, as a form of adoptive immunotherapy, offers several advantages. Neukoplast™ represents a uniform cell population with a well-characterized immunophenotype, confirmed strong anti-tumor activity and are easy to grow and expand in culture, so that they can be made available in large numbers for therapeutic delivery.
