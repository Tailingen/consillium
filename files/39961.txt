A Study of Atezolizumab Plus Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab Plus Placebo as First-Line Treatment in Participants With Recurrent/Metastatic PD-L1 Positive Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab plus tiragolumab and atezolizumab plus placebo as first-line (1L) treatment in recurrent/metastatic PD-L1-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) on the basis of confirmed objective response rate. In addition, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity of atezolizumab and tiragolumab will be evaluated.
