STereotactic sAlvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Prostate Bed Recurrence After prostatectomy-a Prospective Observational Study
STereotactic sAlvage Radiotherapy for macroscopic prostate bed Recurrence after prostatectomy (STARR trial) is a prospective observational study aimed to assess outcome after Stereotactic salvage radiotherapy (SSRT) for macroscopic prostate bed recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

Biochemical relapse free survival (BRFS), Primary endpoint of the study is BRFS after treatment, biochemical relapse is defined as a PSA increase above 0.2 ng/ml for patients with a PSA nadir \< 0.2 ng/ml or 2 consecutive PSA increases \> 25% if compared to nadir in patients with a PSA nadir \> 0.2 ng/ml., 2 year
Rate of patients with complete response, Complete response is defined as PSA nadir \<0.2 ng/ml, at 2 years after treatment
This is a prospective observational multicenter study including patients affected by patients with macroscopic recurrence within prostate bed after RP detected with Choline or PSMA CT-PET and confirmed with pelvic MRI (except for cases in which MRI is contraindicated). Patients will be treated with SSRT on macroscopic prostate bed recurrence for a total dose of from 35 in 5 fractions. Planned size of the overall study population is 90 patients. The study will include a screening phase and a treatment phase. The screening phase allows for assessment of subject eligibility, demographics, PSA, comorbidities and current drug therapies up to 45 days prior to randomization.

The treatment phase consists of SSRT administered on prostate bed macroscopic recurrence. Different techniques will be allowed provided that treatment respects doses and fractionation indicated per-protocol (35 Gy in 5 fractions) and that dose constraints to organs at risk (OAR) reported in this document are observed. The total planned duration of the study is 40 months, consisting in 16 months enrollment period, during which patients will perform the screening and and later phase of 24 months in which patients will continue to be submitted to periodic checks every 3 months.
