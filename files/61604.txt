Dose-Expansion Modular Study To Explore the Safety, Tolerability, and Anti-tumor Activity of HER3- DXd Monotherapy and Combinations in Patients With Inoperable Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) After Progression on T-DXd
ICARUS-BREAST02 is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b/2, platform study that aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of HER3-DXd monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with ABC.

The first 2 modules will evaluate: i. safety and efficacy of HER3-DXd with olaparib in patients with HER2-low and HER2-positive ABC progressed on T-DXd (Module 1) and HER3-DXd monotherapy in patients with HER2-low ABC progressed on T-DXd (Module 0).

The main objective of Part 1 is to assess the safety and tolerability of HER3-DXd monotherapy and combination and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination containing HER3-DXd.

The main objective of Part 2 is to assess the efficacy of study therapies in each module based on investigator assessment as evaluated by the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 months.
