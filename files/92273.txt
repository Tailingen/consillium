EBUS-guided TBNA for Molecular Diagnostic of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes (LN)
The purpose of this study is to perform molecular diagnostic in mediastinal lymph nodes of non-small cell lung cancer patients sampled by endobronchial ultrasound guided finde needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: EBUS_TBNA
NSCLC is a common cancer. Accurate and early staging has a significant impact on outcome. EBUS-TBNA of involved mediastinal lymph nodes is critical. Molecular markers could improve mediastinal staging.
