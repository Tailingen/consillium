Radical Resection of Single-hole Inflatable Mediastinal Mirror Synchronization With Laparoscopic Esophageal Carcinoma
This study is evaluating the feasibility and safety of radical resection of single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma, as well as the clinical value of the radical resection of single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma as a new minimally invasive operation for esophageal carcinoma.
Esophagus Cancer
PROCEDURE: Single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror
Perioperative complication rate, Perioperative complications include: pulmonary infection, respiratory failure, managed pleural effusion, heart failure, myocardial infarction, managed arrhythmia, anastomotic fistula or gastric fistula, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, chylothorax, unscheduled reoperation, Through operation completion, an average of 12 days|Number of lymph nodes dissected, number of lymph nodes dissected during operation, During the operation
Intraoperative bleeding volume, Calculation of intraoperative bleeding with ml/kg, During the operation|Operative time, Calculate the operating time in minutes, During the operation|Proportion of patients undergoing thoracotomy or laparotomy, The ratio of the number of patients converted to thoracotomy or laparotomy to the total number of patients undergoing surgery, During the operation|Intraoperative mortality, The ratio of the number of patients who died during the operation to the number of patients who underwent the operation, During the operation|Postoperative hospital stay, The days of postoperative hospitalization, Up to 2 weeks after the operation|Postoperative pain score, Daily pain scores were recorded by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale/Score) 1-3 days after operation, 1-3 days after the operation|Postoperative icu monitoring time, If the patient needs to be transferred to ICU after operation, stay in icu monitoring time should be observed, 0-12 days after the operation|Incidence of adverse events during and after operation, Special attention is paid to observing whether arrhythmias need to be dealt with during the operation (record the types of arrhythmias, treatment methods, medication, time of occurrence, possible causes), 3 years|Postoperative drainage, Total postoperative thoracic or mediastinal drainage (ml/kg), 0-12 days after the operation|Postoperative drainage tube indwelling time, The retention time of different types of drainage tube, 0-12 days after the operation
Local recurrence rate of tumor within 3 years, The rate of tumor recurrence or metastasis, 3 years
This is a prospective, multicenter, open clinical study in which 155 patients (including 5% shedding rate) who require surgical treatment are scheduled to be included in the study. Prior to any screening process, each subject / legal guardian should sign the informed consent form. Screening tests are used to determine whether each subject is eligible for the study. Eligible subjects who meet the standard will be treated with radical resection of single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma and followed up until 3 years postoperatively. Primary study outcome are the prioperative complication rate and the number of intraoperative lymph node dissection.
