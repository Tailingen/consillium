Broxuridine Plus Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of broxuridine in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage I or stage II prostate cancer. Broxuridine may help doctors determine the rate of growth of prostate tumors and help them plan effective treatment
Stage I Prostate Cancer|Stage IIA Prostate Cancer|Stage IIB Prostate Cancer
DRUG: bromodeoxyuridine|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Average doubling time between low and high volume tumors, Up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Measure the potential doubling times of multifocal adenocarcinomas of the prostate using broxuridine.

II. Determine whether the doubling times of multifocal carcinomas occurring within a single prostate are consistent with a model in which low-volume carcinomas have slow doubling times and high-volume carcinomas have fast doubling times.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive broxuridine IV over 30 minutes on day -1. Approximately 12-96 hours later, patients undergo surgery to remove the prostate. Tumor tissue is examined by immunostaining for the presence of broxuridine to determine doubling times of the tumor.
