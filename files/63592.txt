Pyrotinib in Women With High-risk in Early Stage Breast Cancer
ExteNET study explored neratinib prolong anti-HER2 therapy after trastuzumab therapy found that it can improve disease-free survival in patients with lymph nodes positive; In addition, the subgroup of patients with residual tumors after neoadjuvant therapy was found to improve the survival. However, no conclusive conclusions were reached.

However, since the study was carried out early so only trastuzumab treatment was used, it is urgent to carry out research that is more in line with current clinical practice and bring more benefits to patients. To explore whether pyrotinib can further reduce the risk of recurrence from previously diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab or T-DM1.
