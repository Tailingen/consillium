Posterior Extra-fascial RARP in Intermediate or High Risk Prostate Cancer
This study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. It aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of the posterior approach extrafascial technique and the anterior approach extrafascial technique in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients, to compare the oncological prognosis, functional prognosis, and safety of the two techniques in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients, and to provide evidence-based medical evidence for the choice of surgical treatment modality for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients.

This study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial.

About 118 subjects will be enrolled in this study in a total of 12 research centres across the country, and eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to the posterior approach extrafascial technique group and the anterior approach extrafascial technique group in a 1:1 ratio. All subjects routinely underwent comprehensive and systematic physical examination, laboratory tests and imaging examinations before surgery. After surgery, subjects were followed up at 1 week (visit 2, day 14±2), 1 month (visit 3, day 28±5), 3 months (visit 4, day 90±7), 6 months (visit 5, day 180±7), and 12 months (visit 6, day 360±14) after removal of the urinary catheter after the surgery, and then annually thereafter (visit 7), with urine control rate (defined as 0/ 1 pad) and 24-h pad weight questionnaires, PSA examination, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICI-QSF), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and related scores such as General Health-Related Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Prostate Cancer-Specific Quality of Life (QLQ-PR25). ) and other relevant scores; in case of clinical suspicion of local recurrence, imaging (pelvic MRI), whole-body bone imaging in patients with bone pain, and whole-body PET/CT if necessary. Subjects will be monitored and evaluated for adverse events (AE) throughout the trial. Subjects will participate in the clinical trial for an expected duration of approximately 1 year, after which they will be followed up periodically according to the usual follow-up strategy.
