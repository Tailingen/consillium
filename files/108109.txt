Molecular Pituitary Imaging Using 18F-FET PET
The goal of this single centre pilot study is to explore whether 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine PET (FET-PET) yields comparable findings to 11C-methionine PET (Met-PET) for the localisation of pituitary tumours.
Pituitary Adenoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-Fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET) PET
Maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) over pituitary tumour on each of 11C-methionine and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine PET scans, Comparison of maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) measured over pituitary tumours on each type of PET scan., 1 day
Maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) over normal pituitary gland and parasellar structures (e.g. cavernous sinuses) on each of 11C-methionine and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine PET scans, Comparison of maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) measured over normal pituitary gland and parasellar structures (e.g. cavernous sinuses) on each type of PET scan., 1 day
Up to 20 patients with pituitary adenomas (PA) who have previously undergone 11C-methionine PET (Met-PET) as part of routine clinical care will undergo 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine PET (FET-PET). Patients with newly diagnosed PA or residual/recurrent pituitary tumours following previous treatment will be eligible for recruitment to the study.

Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be performed to assess whether MET-PET and FET-PET yield comparable findings in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent PA.
