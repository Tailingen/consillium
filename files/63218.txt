A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of AUR107 in Patients With Relapsed Advanced Malignancies (SHAKTI-1)
An open-label, first-in-human, Phase 1 study in adult patients with relapsed advanced malignancies will be done to assess AUR107 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and optimal biological dose.
Relapsed Malignant Solid Neoplasm
DRUG: AUR107
First cycle Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Assess dose limiliting toxicities of AUR107, 28 days|Safety of AUR107 as measured by the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (AE) graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, The assessment of safety was based on the frequency of deaths, AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and abnormalities in specific clinical laboratory assessments. AEs and laboratory values will be graded for severity according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0., 28 days|Optimal Biological Dose, Determine optimal Biological dose, 28 days|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum concentration (Cmax), Maximum concentration of AUR107, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax in hours, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetics: Area under the curve (AUC), Area under the curve (AUC) of AUR 107 in h\* mcg/mL, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetics: Mean Residence Time (MRT), Average time the drugs stays in the body, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetics: Terminal elimination half-life, Terminal elimination half-life of AUR 107 in hours, Day 1 and Day 15|Maximum concentration (Cmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare in fast and fed conditions, Day 8 and Day 9|Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare Tmax in fast and fed conditions, Day 8 and Day 9|Area under curve (AUC) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare AUC in fast and fed conditions, Day 8 and Day 9
Exploratory endpoint: Identification of gene expression profiles, Pharmacodynamic marker: Gene Expression profile as assessed by RNA analysis, Day 1, Day 2, and Day 15|Exploratory endpoint- Efficacy assessments, Overall Response Rate, Efficacy assessments-Overall Response Rate, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Exploratory endpoint- Efficacy assessments, Duration of Response, Efficacy assessments- Duration of Response, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Exploratory endpoint- Efficacy assessments, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Efficacy assessments- Progression Free Survival (PFS), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Median Change from Baseline to End of Treatment in Tumor-Specific Markers, CA-125 in ovarian cancer, Change in Tumor Specific Markers - CA-125 in ovarian cancer, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Median Change from Baseline to End of Treatment in Tumor-Specific Markers, PSA in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer, Change in Tumor Specific Markers - PSA in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Median Change from Baseline to End of Treatment in Tumor-Specific Markers, CEA in colorectal cancer, Change in Tumor Specific Markers - CEA in colorectal cancer, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a Phase I, Open Label, Dose-Escalation, First-in-Human study in adult patients with select relapsed advanced malignancies. The safety and tolerability of oral AUR107 will be evaluated in patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Non-small cell lung cancer, Gastric cancer, Urothelial cancer, Kidney cancer, Colon cancer, and Esophageal cancer) who do not have any available curative or life-prolonging treatment options and have exhausted all effective locally available therapies. The traditional 3+3 design for dose escalation will be used to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and determine the Optimal Biological Dose of AUR107 as a single agent. The Optimal Biological Dose will be selected using a totality of safety, PK, and PD data.
