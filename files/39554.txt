CellFX Treat & Resect Low-Risk BCC Feasibility Study
This prospective, multicenter, study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System in adults subjects with low-risk basal cell carcinoma (superficial and nodular) for complete histological clearance of the target lesion followed by surgical tumor excision 60 days post-treatment.
BCC - Basal Cell Carcinoma|BCC|Excision Margin
DEVICE: CellFX System
Number of Lesions With BCC Histological Clearance, The primary effectiveness endpoint is the total number of lesions with complete histological clearance of the BCC lesion during histological review of microscopic analysis using H \& E slides. Counts and proportions will be assessed., 60-days post-CellFX procedure|Number of Participants With Treatment Related Serious Adverse Events, No serious adverse events related to CellFX Treatment or Procedure, 60-days post-CellFX procedure
The study will enroll healthy adult subjects with confirmed low-risk (superficial and nodular) BCC lesion(s) by biopsy, excluding BCCs located on the face, neck, scalp, axilla, hands, feet, and genitals not exceeding 1.5 cm. Macrophotography of all study BCCs will be captured and clinically assessed by the site investigator for characterization of healing and scar appearance prior to and post-surgical excision. All subjects will be followed at 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60-days post-CellFX procedure and at 14, 30 and 60-days post-excision. Adverse events will be documented.
