DRUG: 89Zr-DFO-SC16.56|DRUG: SC16.56, Phase I, Cohort 2|DRUG: SC16.56, Phase I, Cohort 3|DRUG: SC16.56, Phase II
Phase I: Radiation Dosimetry of 89Zr- DFO-SC16.56 PET/CT imaging in participants, The PET and blood data are used to quantify tracer-biodistribution, measuring the amount of radioactivity present in the blood and bodily regions-of-interest, Up to 12 months|Phase I: Safety of 89Zr- DFO-SC16.56 PET/CT imaging in cancer patients by evaluating toxicities, 89Zr- DFO-SC16.56 PET/CT will be considered safe if there are no possibly probably, or definitely related grade 3 or higher toxicities (except allergic reactions) among the patients enrolled in the phase I portion, up to 12 months|Phase II: Correlation between tumor uptake of 89Zr- DFO-SC16.56 with expression of DLL3, This is determined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative mass spectrometry., Up to 12 months
