Change from baseline anxiety at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, it will be measured using the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). It includes 7 items for anxiety (DASS21-A). A 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3 was designed for each item, and the scores will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score. Thus, the anxiety score can range from 0 to 42. The higher the score is the more severe anxiety. The score of 0-7 is normal, 8-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 severe, +20 extremely severe., ebaseline, T1 after 3 weeks, T2 after 6 weeks|Change from baseline depression at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, it will be measured using the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). It includes 7 items for depression (DASS21-D). A 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3 was designed on each item, and the scores will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score. Thus, the depression score can range from 0 to 42. The higher the score is the more severe depression. The score of 0-9 is normal, 10-13 mild, 14-20 moderate, 21-27 severe, +28 extremely severe., baseline, T1 after 3 weeks, T2 after 6 weeks
Change from baseline stress at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, it will be measured using the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). It includes 7 items for stress (DASS21-S). A 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3 was designed for each item, and the scores will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score. Thus, the stress score can range from 0 to 42. The higher the score is the more severe stress. The score of 0-14 is normal, 15-18 mild, 19-25 moderate, 26-33 severe, +34 extremely severe., baseline, T1 after 3 weeks, T2 after 6 weeks|Change from baseline coping styles at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, Coping will be measured using Brief COPE. The Brief-COPE is a 28 item self-report questionnaire designed to measure effective and ineffective ways to cope with a stressful life event.The scale can determine someone's primary coping styles with scores on the following three subscale:

Problem-Focussed Coping, Emotion-Focussed Coping, Avoidant Coping.A 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 4 was designed on each item., baseline, T1 after 3 weeks, T2 after 6 weeks|Change from baseline quality of life at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, coping will be measured using FACT-G.It evaluates in functional scales on Social/family well-being (SWB); Emotional well-being (EWB) and Functional well-being (FWB). Each item is scored in one of five categories of 0-4, with 'Not at all', 'A little bit', 'some what', 'Quite a bit' 'Very much'. The higher the score is the better quality of life." The possible range of scores is from 0 to 112., baseline, T1 after 3 weeks, T2 after 6 weeks|Change from baseline satisfaction of nursing care at 3 weeks, satisfaction of nursing care will be measured using numerical rating scale.(0-10) from 0 = completely dissatisfied with the care to 10 = completely satisfied with the care., baseline, T1 after 3 weeks,
Aim: To assess the effect of MCP on anxiety, depression and QoL of BGC patients receiving chemotherapy.

Objectives

* To assess the effect of MCP on the anxiety of BGC patients receiving chemotherapy.
* To assess the effect of MCP on depression of BGC patients receiving chemotherapy.
* To assess the effect of MCP on QoL and patients' satisfaction of BGC patients receiving chemotherapy.
* To determine whether stress level, coping and coping styles mediate the intervention effect on anxiety, depression and QoL.

Hypothesis

* The participants receiving MCP will have a significantly lower level of anxiety compared to the control group.
* The participants receiving MCP will have a significantly lower level of depression compared to the control group.
* The participants receiving MCP will have significantly higher QoL scores and levels of satisfaction with care service compared to the control group.
* Stress level, coping will mediate the intervention on target outcomes.
