Usefulness of Calprotectin for Colon Adenoma Screening
The fecal calprotectin assay is used widely for inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis and the assessment of the disease activity. Some adenoma patients have elevated fecal calprotectin level, which could mean the role of fecal calprotectin as a screening marker for colon adenoma. We will investigate the usefulness of fecal calprotectin as colon adenoma marker for screening in this study.
