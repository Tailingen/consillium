Effect of GnRH Agonist vs GnRH Antagonist on IVF/ICSI Outcomes in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients.
This prospective, non-randomised, open-label, clinical trial is conducting on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) subjects to compare the effects of two pituitary suppression regimens; GnRH Agonist-Long Protocol and GnRH Antagonist-Flexible Protocol on clinical and embryological IVF/ICSI outcomes, and on the follicular fluid levels of Placental Growth Factor (PlGF); which is known for his pivotal role in the regulation of ovulation, embryo development, and implantation

DRUG: Triptorelin acetate|DRUG: Cetrorelix|DRUG: recombinant-FSH or recombinant-FSH + human Menopausal Gonadotropin|DRUG: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)
Follicular fluid Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) Concentrations:, Follicular fluid samples will be obtained on the day of oocyte retrieval, then they will be centrifuged to eliminate cellular elements and debris. After that, the supernatants will be frozen at -80 until assayed using an Elisa kit., Immediately after oocyte retrieval (35±2 hours after hCG administration)
Number of oocytes retrieved, The oocytes will be retrieved by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration 35±2 hours after hCG administration., Immediately after oocyte retrieval (35±2 hours after hCG administration)|Number of Metaphase II Oocytes (MII):, The oocyte maturity will be assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Maturation Rate%:, Maturation Rate is calculated by dividing the number of mature (MII) oocytes by the number of retrieved oocytes., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Fertilization Rate%:, Fertilization Rate is calculated by dividing the number of obtained zygote (2PN) by the number of injected oocytes., 16-18 hours after microinjection.|Cleavage Rate%:, Cleavage rate is calculated by dividing the number of cleavaged embryos by the number of zygotes (2PN)., Day 2 after microinjection.|Embryo Quality:, Embryos are assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope based on ESHRE criteria (2011)., Day of transfer (2 or 3 days after microinjection).|High Quality Embryos rate%:, High Quality Embryos rate is calculated by dividing the number of high quality embryos (Grade I) by the total number of cleavaged embryos., Day of transfer (2 or 3 days after microinjection).|Biochemical Pregnancy Rate% (Per Embryo Transfer):, Biochemical pregnancy is defined as a positive serum beta-hCG pregnancy test after 2 weeks of embryo transfer. The biochemical pregnancy rate is calculated by dividing the number of women who are biochemically pregnant by the number of women who have at least 1 embryo transferred., 2 weeks after embryo transfer|Clinical Pregnancy Rate% (Per Embryo Transfer):, Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of a gestational sac on ultrasound after 3-4 weeks of embryo transfer. The clinical pregnancy rate is calculated as by dividing the number of women who are clinically pregnant divided by the number of women who have at least 1 embryo transferred., 3-4 weeks after embryo transfer
