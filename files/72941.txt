A Study of Intensity-Modulated Pleural Radiation Therapy (IMPRINT) in People With Thymic Cancer That Has Spread to the Lining of the Lungs and Chest
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether hemithoracic intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT) is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects in people with pleural metastases from thymic malignancies. The researchers will also look at whether hemithoracic IMPRINT is effective against participants' cancer.

RADIATION: Intensity-Modulated Pleural Radiation Therapy (IMPRINT)
assess the rate of radiation pneumonitis, as indicated by the rate of grade 3 or higher radiation pneumonitis defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 5.0., 2 years
progression-free survival (PFS), PFS events will include death and/or progression of thymic malignancy due to local-regional or distant recurrence/progression. PFS will be calculated from the start of radiation treatment and will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., 12 month
