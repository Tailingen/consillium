Testicular Function and Semen Quality in Male Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Survivors
Cancer treatment can affect the testicular function, including sperm and hormonal functions. The aim of this study is to assess the testicular function and semen quality in young men who recover from childhood and adolescent cancer in Hong Kong. This can provide more information for pre-treatment counselling as well as improve post treatment survivorship care. The testicular function will be compared to aged-matched controls from men attending the Family Planning Association for premarital check-up.
