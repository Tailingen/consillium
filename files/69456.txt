Evaluation of Nevisense as Support Tool for the Diagnose of Keratinocyte Skin Cancer
This is a prospective study to assess efficacy of the Nevisense device in identifying keratinocyte skin cancer (KC) in patients suspected of having skin cancer based on the initial physician's assessment.

All skin lesions with a suspicion of Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), Invasive Squamos cell Carcinoma (iSCC), Bowen's disease (BD) or actinic keratosis (AK) and destined for excision or biopsy for further histopathological analysis will be considered for inclusion in the study.
Keratinocyte Skin Cancer
DEVICE: Nevisense
Nevisense Sensitivity and Specificity, This study has two primary endpoints:

1. Sensitivity â‰¥ 0.90
2. Sensitivity + Specificity \> 1.0

Sensitivity is the proportion of correctly identified cases of KC. Specificity is the proportion of correctly identified cases of non-KC, 1 year
