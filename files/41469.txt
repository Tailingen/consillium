A Phase II Study of Chiauranib in Combine With Capecitabine in TNBC
This study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of chiauranib in combine with capecitabine in advanced triple-negative breast cancer failed to prior anthracyclines and taxanes therapy
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Chiauranib|DRUG: capecitabine
ORR(Objective reponse rate), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients with complete or partial response evaluated by RECIST 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2years
CBR (Clinical Benefit Rate), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) will be determined by looking at the number of subjects who have either a complete response, partial response, or stable disease for greater than or equal to 24 weeks, per RECIST 1.1, 2years|PFS (Progression-free survival), From date of the first dose of study drug until the date of first documented progression or relapse or date of death from any cause, whichever came first,, 2years|DoR (Duration of response), 2years|OS(Overall survival), 2years|AEs, percentage of AEs, 2years
Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3,PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target nonreceptor kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms of clinical relevance.

This study including two phases: (1) dose-escalation , this phase using a 3+3design，9-18 patients will be enrolled and receive 25mg/35mg/50mg chiauranib and 1000mg/m2 capecitabine Q3W. (2) dose-expansion，About 20 patients will be enrolled and receive the MTD dose of chiauranib and 1000mg/m2 capecitabine Q3W.

This study also to explore the PK variation and gene expression via blood samples
