Neoadjuvant Treatment Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Plus Cyclophosphamide Sequential Docetaxel Plus Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab Versus Docetaxel Plus Carboplatin Combined With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, open label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled clinical study.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pegylated liposomal doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PLD + C + HP followed by THP) regimen compared with a docetaxel + carboplatin plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (TCbHP) regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer.

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, The percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer (ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system) when the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining after completion of systemic neoadjuvant therapy., Within 2 to 5 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy
Objective response rate (ORR) at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, The number of participants who achieved complete response and partial response at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a percentage of the overall evaluable participants., After the last dose to before surgery or within 21 days|5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to tumor recurrence or death from any cause. 5-year DFS rate is the percentage of participants with DFS from enrollment through 5 years., 5 years|Breast conservation rate at surgery, Percentage of participants receiving breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy., Within 2 to 5 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, including overall and Grade 3/4 adverse events., Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, including overall and Grade 3/4 adverse events., 5 years|Percentage of Participants with dose reductions of chemotherapy due to Grade 3/4 adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, Percentage of Participants with dose reductions of chemotherapy due to Grade 3/4 adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, 1 year|Percentage of Participants with chemotherapy delay due to Grade 3/4 adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, Percentage of Participants with chemotherapy delay due to Grade 3/4 adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0, 1 year|Relative dose intensity (RDI), RDI=actual dose intensity\* / standard dose intensity# actual dose intensity\* = drug standard dose (mg/m\^2) / weeks of administration per cycle (week) standard dose intensity# = actual standard dose (mg/m\^2) / actual dosing weeks (week), 1 year
Subgroup analysis of pathological complete response (pCR) rates based on clinically relevant baseline characteristics, Subgroup analysis of pathological complete response (pCR) rates based on clinically relevant baseline characteristics, Within 2 to 5 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Biomarkers, To explore the biomarkers and mechanisms related to neoadjuvant therapy using high-throughput sequencing technology (NGS), and to screen the patients who are suitable for anthracycline-containing neoadjuvant therapy, From before neoadjuvant therapy to surgery
This is a multicenter, open label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled clinical study.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pegylated liposomal doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PLD + C + HP followed by THP) regimen compared with a docetaxel + carboplatin plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (TCbHP) regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer.
