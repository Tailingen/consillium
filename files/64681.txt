The Hypotension Prediction Index in Free Flap Transplant in Head and Neck Surgery.
The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of the Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) on the degree of intraoperative hypotension in patients undergoing free flap surgery. The hypothesis is that implementation of the HPI algorithm will reduce the time-weighted average (TWA) intraoperative hypotension below a threshold of 65 mmHg (16), and to reveal the relationship between the episodes of hypotension and free flap viability and function.

TWA Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) < 65 mmHg, TWA - MAP \< 65 mmHg - time weighed average = (depth of hypotension in millimeters of mercury below a MAP of 65 mmHg x time in minutes spent below MAP of 65mmHg)/total duration of operation in minutes, From the beginning of the anesthesia to the end of anesthesia
