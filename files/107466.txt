COVID-19: Immune Response in Patients With Cancer Undergoing mRNA Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2
This trial aims to measure the humoral and adaptive immune response in patients with cancer diagnosis undergoing mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and assess its efficacy in preventing COVID-19.

Humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after the last dose of a mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Baseline assessment), Rate of humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 between 3 and 12 months after the last dose (before ICF signature) of a mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (baseline assessment), 3 to 12 months after the last dose
Humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2, Duration of humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2 based on the final study assessment, namely at 6 months (+ /- 4 weeks) after the baseline assessment or at 6 months (+ 4 weeks/- 8 weeks) after the first booster dose after ICF signature, if a booster dose of the vaccine is administered during the study per local / national health policy guidelines., at 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) after the baseline assessment or at 6 months (+ 4 weeks/- 8 weeks) after the first booster after ICF signature, if a booster dose of the vaccine is administered during the study per local / national health policy guidelines.|Humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2 by cohort, Rate of humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2 by cohort, 3 to 12 months after the last dose before ICF signature; and 6 months (+/- 4 wks) after baseline assessment or 6 months (+ 4 wks/-8 wks) after the first booster after ICF signature if a booster dose is administered during the study|Rate of asymptomatic subjects with SARS-CoV-2 positive test during the study, Rate of asymptomatic subjects with SARS-CoV-2 positive test, confirmed COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 infection with onset at least 14 days after the last dose before ICF signature in subjects who had been without serologic or virological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 14 days after the last dose before ICF signature., Retrospectively collected at each visit: at baseline assessment, pre-boosting (within 2 wks before 1st booster dose after ICF signature), post-boosting (2 wks after this booster); and 6 months after this booster OR after baseline assessment if no booster|Safety of booster dose(s) of mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine received after ICF signature, Frequency, duration and severity of adverse reactions reported according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events signature (CTCAE) Version 5.0, if booster dose(s) of the vaccine are administered during the study per local / national health policy guidelines., During the 30 days following the administration of the booster received during the study period (if any)
Rate of humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2 before and after the last dose, Rate of humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2 at pre- (within 2 weeks before the first booster after ICF signature) and post-boosting (at 2 weeks +/- 3 days after the first booster after ICF signature) if a booster dose is administered during the study per local/national health policy guidelines., within 2 weeks before the first booster after ICF signature, at 2 weeks +/- 3 days after the first booster after ICF signature) if a booster dose is administered during the study per local/national health policy guidelines|Changes in the levels of circulating cytokines/chemokines and the balance or differentiation/activation status of lymphocyte subpopulations and their association with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, Changes in the levels of circulating cytokines/chemokines and the balance or differentiation/activation status of lymphocyte subpopulations and their association with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, i) 3 to 12 months after the last dose before ICF signature; AND ii) in case of booster before ICF signature, 2 wks before the first booster, 2 wks after this booster, 6 months after this booster OR iii) if no booster 6 months after baseline assessment
