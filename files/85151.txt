To assess the efficacy and safety of Temozolomide for second-line treatment of Neuroendocrine Carcinomas progressing after first-line Platinum-based therapy.
Neuroendocrine Carcinomas
DRUG: Temozolomide
Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR), 6 months
Second Line Progression Free Survival (PFS), Second Line Progression Free Survival (PFS), 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease (Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease \[CR+PR+SD\]) at Week 24., 12 month|Safety and tolerability - Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AE)., The NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 will be used to evaluate the clinical safety of the treatment in this study. Intensity of all adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5). AEs not listed on the NCI-CTCAE should be graded according below. Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life threatening/disabling; Grade 5: Death., 1 month|Safety and tolerability - Incidence of abnormal laboratory test results, The following assessments will be conducted in order to monitor patient safety:

1. Hematology tests as per institutional standards.
2. Biochemistry tests as per institutional standards.
3. Coagulation tests as per institutional standards.
4. Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential., 1 month|Safety and tolerability - Incidence of abnormal vital signs, * Blood pressure (mm/Hg)
* Temperature (Â°C), 1 month|Safety and tolerability - Incidence of abnormal ECG readings, This examination is essential to highlight the presence of:

* arrhythmias,
* discontinuous heart rhythm changes,
* ischemia, i.e. reduced blood supply to the heart,
* presence of ailments such as heartbeat, chest pain, loss of consciousness or dizziness., 1 month|Quality of Life (QoL) - QoL will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Trial in Cancer QOL core (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire (version 3) [Quality of life questionnaire - QLQ], The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionaire of 30-item and it incorporates 9 multi-item scales:5 functional scales (Physical,Role,Cognitive,Emotional and Social Functioning);3 symptom scales (Fatigue,Pain and Nausea/Vomiting) and a Global Health Status/QoL scale.6 single item scales are also included (Dyspnoea,Insomnia,Appetite Loss,Constipation,Diarrhoea and Financial Difficulties).Version 3.0 has 4-point scales for the first 5 items comprising the Physical Functioning scale.These are coded with the same response categories as items 6 to 28,namely "1 Not at all" (minimum value),"2 A little","3 Quite a bit" and "4 Very much" (maximum value).The last 2 question foresee a 7-point response scale:minimum value is "1 Very poor",maximum value is "7 Excellent"., 1 month|Quality of Life (QoL) - QoL will be assessed using disease specific modules for Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET), the EORTC QLQ GINET21 (EORTC QLQ Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors 21)., The QLQ-GINET21 contains 21 items:4 single-item assessments relating to muscle and/or bone pain (MBP),body image (BI),information (INF) and sexual functioning (SX),together with 17 items organised into 5 proposed scales:endocrine symptoms (ED 3 items),GI symptoms (GI 5 items),treatment-related symptoms (TR 3 items),social functioning (SF) of the new module (SF21, 3 items) and disease-related worries (DRW 3 items).The response format of the questionnaire is a 4-point Likert scale:"1 Not at all" (minimum value),"2 A little","3 Quite a bit" and "4 Very much" (maximum value)., 1 month
