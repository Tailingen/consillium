Microwave Plus Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy for Advanced NSCLC
This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase III trial that compares microwave plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) and the key secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS). A total of 275 eligible patients will be randomized to receive either microwave ablation combinated with first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy（138） or first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy（137） in a 1:1 ratio until patients. The response of microwave ablation will be assessed by the expert consensus for thermal ablation of primary and metastatic lung tumors. Tumor response and progression will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）1.1.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Microwave ablation
progression free survival, From the start of chemotherapy or ablation to the date of progression or death, up to 12 months after the last patient randomized
Patients will be randomized to treated with microwave ablation and chemotherapy or treated with chemotherapy alone.
