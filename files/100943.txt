Durvalumab Plus Etoposide-free Chemotherapy in First-line Treatment of Extensive-disease Small-sell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
The current study is intended to be a "proof of concept" to evaluate the potential value of synergy between paclitaxel carboplatin and immunotherapy. If a signal clearly shows superiority over the CASPIAN data , we will have arguments to think that the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is more suitable for synergy with immunotherapy than the standard etoposide and carboplatin.
