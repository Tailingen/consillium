Nutrition and Chemotherapy
Patients treated for cancer nowadays have many means of information and tend to become more and more involved in their health. The interest of a therapeutic fast with detoxifying or even curative properties, with a specific indication for cancer patients treated by chemotherapy, is nowadays relayed by the media. To date, there are no studies conducted on the scope of this information in cancer patients or on the attitudes of oncologists towards this practice and possible positioning requests from patients.

We hypothesize that the choice of this practice and its modalities are rarely discussed with oncologists, although it may have deleterious repercussions on the patient's health.

We propose a research based on the principles of sociological intervention. Its objectives are a first review of the issue and the establishment of a joint working group, including patients, carers and researchers, which will propose solutions to improve the patient/carer dialogue on this issue.
