A Study in Cancer Patients With Hepatic Impairment to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of NKTR-102 (Etirinotecan Pegol)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the PK and safety of NKTR-102 in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors in Patients With Hepatic Impairment
DRUG: 145 mg/m2 NKTR 102|DRUG: 120 mg/m2 NKTR 102|DRUG: 50 mg/m2 NKTR 102
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of NKTR-102 and its metabolites, 1 pre-dose PK measurements 14 post-dose PK measurements, Day 1 through Day 42
Safety and tolerability of NKTR-102, Assessments are: physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, AEs, and laboratory testing., Day 1 through Day 42
Safety and PK data from patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment will be compared with a control group consisting of patients with normal hepatic function.
