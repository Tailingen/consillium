BIOLOGICAL: DK210 (EGFR)|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|BIOLOGICAL: Immune checkpoint blockers|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) with DK210 (EGFR), Based on toxicities observed, Minimum of 90 days from initiation of experimental therapy|Identify recommended dose of DK210 (EGFR), Based on toxicities observed, Initiation of therapy up to day 90|Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) of DK210 (EGFR) in combination with radiation, chemotherapy, or checkpoint blockers in Parts B, C, D, Based on toxicities observed, Minimum of 90 days from initiation of experimental therapy
Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) will be based on clinical examination and investigator review of radiographic images, Initiation of therapy up to approximately 12 months|Best response rate at 9 weeks, Based on investigator clinical examination and review of radiographic images, Initiation of therapy through Day 63|Progression-free (PFS), Time from first dose of DK210 (EGFR) to first documentation of clinical or radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Study Day 1 until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from first dose of DK210 (EGFR) to the time of death, Assessed up to 24 months|Serum concentrations of DK210 (EGFR) will be determined at various time points, Concentration vs time and standard pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be summarized by dose level, From initiation of treatment through 12 months (every 9 weeks)|Serum will be assayed for the presence of anti-DK210 (EGFR) antibodies, Results will be summarized by dose level, From initiation of treatment through 12 months (every 9 weeks)|Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be performed by flow cytometry at various time points, Results will be summarized by dose level, From initiation of treatment through day 63|Serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, IL-1b, and interferon (IFN)-g will be assessed at various time points, Results will be summarized by dose level, From initiation of treatment through 12 months (every 9 weeks)
This study will evaluate DK210(EGFR) as monotherapy and combination in subjects with advanced solid EGFR expressing cancers with documented progressive disease after at least one line of systemic treatment (staging performed by local standard).
