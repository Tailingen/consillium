Testing Lenvatinib in Patients With Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drug lenvatinib has on the patient and on adenoid cystic carcinoma. This type of cancer study is called a phase II study. Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will shrink the cancer by at least one-quarter compared to its present size.

Lenvatinib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if lenvatinib is a useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas.
