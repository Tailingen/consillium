Trilaciclib Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy and Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Esophageal Cancer
This study is a double-arm, randomized, controlled, single-center, phase II clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus immunotherapy with or without Trilaciclib in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma that is not resectable.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Trilaciclib Injection [Cosela]|DRUG: Placebo
Incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia, Incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 84 days
Incidence of G-CSF treatment, Incidence of G-CSF treatment, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 1 years|Incidence of platelet transfusion, Incidence of platelet transfusion, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 1 years|Incidence of grade ≥3 anemia, Incidence of grade ≥3 anemia, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 84 days|Incidence of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, Incidence of grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 84 days
The subjects included in the study will receive Trilaciclib combined with chemoradiotherapy and immunosuppressant group ( the experimental group) and chemoradiotherapy combined with immunosuppressant group ( the control group). The experimental group and the control group were treated with 4 cycles of treatment. If the efficacy was evaluated as non-progressive after 4 cycles of treatment, the experimental group and the control group continued immunosuppressive therapy until disease progression or intolerance. The incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia during chemotherapy was used as the primary endpoint.
