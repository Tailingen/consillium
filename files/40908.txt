Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with malignant glioma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: therapeutic autologous dendritic cells
Dose Limiting Toxicity, 4 weeks
Time to tumor progression, overall survival and cellular immune responses in brain tumor patients injected with tumor lysate pulsed dendritic cells, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with malignant gliomas.
* Determine survival, tumor progression, and cellular immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are prepared from autologous PBMC exposed to sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 and pulsed with autologous tumor lysate. Patients receive autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-18 months.
