Safety and Efficacy of Sintilimab in Combination With Chemoradiothrapy Followed by D2 Surgical Resection in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer With Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Metastasis
Gastric cancer with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis was considered as unresectable, to improve these patients' prognosis, we designed systematic conversion therapy including immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to estimate safety and efficacy of Sintilimab in combination with chemoradiothrapy followed by D2 surgical resection in patients with advanced gastric cancer with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis.
