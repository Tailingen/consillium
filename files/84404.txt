AI-Based Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Gastric Cancer Using Preoperative Multimodal Data
This study aims to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict whether lymph node metastasis has occurred in patients with gastric cancer before surgery. Using preoperative imaging and pathology data, the AI models will not only predict if metastasis is present but also identify which specific lymph node stations or individual lymph nodes are involved. All lymph nodes will be carefully removed during surgery and examined one by one with detailed pathological methods to ensure accurate diagnosis. The goal is to improve the accuracy of lymph node assessment and assist doctors in making better treatment decisions.
