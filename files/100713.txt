Predicting Progression of Developing Myeloma in a High-Risk Screened Population (PROMISE)
The PROMISE Study aims to establish a prospective cohort of individuals with precursor conditions to multiple myeloma, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). We will study these patients as a means to identify risk factors for progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
OTHER: Sample of Blood
Time to progression (TTP) from MGUS/SMM to overt multiple myeloma., Progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma, 15 years
The goal of the PROMISE research study is to determine clinical/genomic alterations present in individuals with MGUS and SMM, who are diagnosed through screening of a high-risk population. We also seek to determine clinical/genomic/epigenetic and immune environmental predictors of progression to multiple myeloma in patients with MGUS and SMM.
