Preoperative Intraarterial Chemoembolization Combined With Radiotherpy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Compared to postoperative chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, preoperative chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy shows higher sphincter preservation rate and lower local recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response and prognosis of intraarterial chemoembolization and intravenous infusion chemotherapy in patients with rectal T3-T4 and/or N+ rectal cancer before operation.
Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: intraarterial chemoembolization|DEVICE: intravenous chemotherapy
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathological complete response (pCR) was determined on tumor resection specimens after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, and was defined as no evidence of residual invasive and ductal disease in the rectum and lymph nodes, pathologic examination following surgery, at aproximately 9-10 weeks or after preoperative intraarterial chemoembolization plus radiotherpy
the Sphincter Preservation Rate, 3 month|Disease-free survival, Following surgery, 5 years|Overall Survival, the first day of treatment to death or last survival confirm date; assesed up to 5 years|Down Staging Rate, Until surgery at 8-9 weeks post chemoradiation plus radiation (which is 4-5 weeks)|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Until surgery at 8-9 weeks post chemoradiation plus radiation (which is 4-5 weeks)|Number of Postoperative Complication, Until surgery at 8-9 weeks post chemoradiation plus radiation (which is 4-5 weeks)
