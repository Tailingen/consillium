Functional Study of the Hypothalamus in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
The aim to evaluate whether activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in PCOS is associated with transient microstructural and metabolic changes in the female hypothalamus using MRI approaches to assess water diffusion and measure proton magnetic resonance spectra.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Cyproterone Acetate + estradiol|DRUG: Levonorgestrel, Ethinyl Estradiol 0.1-0.02Mg Oral Tablet
Change in the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), The change in the ADC will be analyzed in healthy volunteers and PCOS women before starting the oral contraceptives, and next during the third sequence of treatment., Baseline and 3 months after treatment start
Change in the metabolite concentrations, The change in the metabolite concentrations will be analyzed in the two groups before starting the oral contraceptives, and next during the third sequence of treatment., Baseline and 3 months after treatment start|Correlation coefficient (Spearman or Pearson) between the ADC and serum hormonal levels (FSH,luteinizing hormone,oestradiol, AMH), The correlation between ADC and hormonal levels in the two groups will be analysed before starting the contraceptive treatment and during the third processing sequence., Baseline and 3 months after treatment start|Correlation coefficient (Spearman or Pearson) between the metabolite concentrations and serum hormonal levels (FSH, luteinizing hormone, oestradiol, AMH), The correlation between metabolite concentrations and hormonal levels in the two groups will be analysed before starting the contraceptive treatment and during the third processing sequence., Baseline and 3 months after treatment start|Plasma GnRH concentration before and after treatment (PCOS patient and control group), Baseline and 3 months after treatment start|Correlation between brain metabolite concentrations and plasma GnRH concentration before and after contraception., Baseline and 3 months after treatment start
