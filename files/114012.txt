Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Men With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer
Background:

- Men who continue to have an elevated or rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level after their primary prostate cancer treatment are at increased risk for their cancer to progress. The time it takes to progress is highly variable. One way to predict this progression is based on the change in PSA levels over time. This is called the PSA doubling time (PSADT). Researchers want to test a vaccine on men with Stage D0 prostate cancer. Stage D0 means the PSA has become detectable again or has started to rise after primary treatment, but has not spread to other organs.

Objectives:

- To test a vaccines effectiveness on the rate of PSA increase using PSADT and tumor growth rates.

Eligibility:

- Men with Stage D0 prostate cancer with a PSADT between 3 and 15 months.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with blood tests, scans, physical exam, and medical history. Their prostate cancer will be confirmed.
* Participants will undergo apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood, minus the white cells, will be returned through a needle in the other arm.
* Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit, they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.
* Participants will get injections of either the vaccine or placebo at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24. Both will be made from the participants own cells.
* Participants will be selected randomly to receive either active vaccine or placebo. For every two participants assigned to active vaccine, one participant will be assigned to placebo vaccine.
* Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to to complete after receiving vaccine.
* The study lasts 96 weeks.

Change in the Slope Log of Prostate-specific Antigen Pre vs Post Treatment, PSA Doubling Time (PSADT) and slope log (PSA) were calculated at every study visit using the PSADT Memorial Sloane Kettering nomogram. The values were calculated to demonstrate the rate of rise of PSA, expressed as the velocity in nanograms/mL/year, or the PSA doubling time, in months or years. PSA is a tumor marker for prostate cancer and after surgery (undetectable - e.g. \<0.2 ng/mL) or radiation PSA should fall to a very low level when the disease is effectively treated. When PSA increases (\>2.0 ng/mL) after surgery or radiation that could mean recurrence of the disease. If prostate cancer is growing slower or shrinking after the treatment, PSADT can be longer while PSA slope log is shorter as tumor will make less PSA., One year pre-enrollment; weeks 3-24, and 3 - 48 post vaccine
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of vaccine treatment to time of progression or death. Given the study population in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, progression is defined as 1)"radiographic progression" by computed tomography (CT) or bone scan, 2) prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) that is 3 month or shorter, 3) PSADT decrease 50% or more compared to enrollment PSADT., Week 96 after initial vaccination
Number of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the number of participants with non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 54 months and 13 days for cohort 1 and 5 months and 9 days for cohort 2.
TARP

* T-cell receptor g alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is a 58 amino acid protein expressed by both normal and malignant prostate cancer tissue; 95% of prostate cancer specimens are positive for TARP expression. TARP is highly expressed in prostate cancers of all Gleason types, in primary as well as metastatic disease, and in hormone sensitive and castrate resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, TARP is an ideal tumor antigen target for a vaccine.
* A prospective, randomized pilot study of 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination (National Cancer Institute (NCI) 09-C-0139) utilizing TARP WT 27-35 and EE29-37-9V peptides was conducted in human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A 0201) positive men with stage D0 prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence) and a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of greater than or equal to 3 months and less than or equal to 15 months. TARP vaccination was found to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated, with adverse events limited to injection site reactions less than or equal to Grade 2. TARP vaccination was also associated with a decreased slope log PSA compared to pre-vaccination baseline in 72% of subjects reaching 24 weeks and 74% reaching 48 weeks (p=0.0012 and p=0.0004 for overall changes in slope log PSA, respectively); TARP vaccination also resulted in a 50% decrease in calculated tumor growth rate constant: pre-vaccine g = 0.0042/day, post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day (p=0.003); TARP-specific interferon gamma (IFN-g) enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) responses were detected in the majority of subjects but did not correlate with decreases in slope log (PSA).

Multi-Epitope (ME) TARP Vaccine

* The vaccine platform includes the original two 9-mer HLA-A\*0201 binding TARP peptide epitopes (WT27-35 and EE29-37-9V) utilized in NCI 09-C-0139 as well as an additional five 20-mer TARP peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids for a total of 7 peptides that span the amino acid sequence of the entire TARP protein.
* The advantage of this multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform is that the overlapping epitopes cover the entire TARP protein, resulting in potential for induction of a multi-valent anti-TARP response. In addition, these longer synthetic peptides include TARP-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC)class II cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell helper epitopes that will allow generation of better cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell responses with improved functional avidity and longevity as well as humoral anti-TARP antibody responses.

Study Objectives:
