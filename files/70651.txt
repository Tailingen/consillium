Predictive Factors of Conversion in Laparoscopic Colorectal Cancer Resection
Background Laparoscopic resection is the treatment of choice for colorectal cancer. Rates of conversion to open surgery range between 7% and 30% and controversy exists as to the effect of this on oncologic outcomes. The objective of this study was to analyze what factors are predictive of conversion and what effect they have on oncologic outcomes.

Material \& Methods From a prospective database of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery between 2000 and 2018 a uni- and multivariate analyses were made of demographic, pathological and surgical variables together with complementary treatments comparing purely laparoscopic resection with conversions to open surgery. Overall and disease-free survival were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Conversion to open rate: predictive factors oncological outcomes, 2000-2018
Laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer is the surgical option of choice provided that established oncologic principles are guaranteed \[1-4\].

Apart from the well-known advantages of minimally invasive surgery (shorter hospital stays, lower pain levels, faster return of bowel functions and rapid return to normal daily activities) reductions in operative morbidity and mortality have been reported together with oncologic outcomes which are similar to those of open surgery \[5-7\].

However, reported conversion rates to open surgery are highly variable (7% - 30%) as is the impact of conversion on oncologic outcomes \[8-10\]). The objectives of this study were to identify the risk factors associated with conversion and to assess their impact on operative morbidity and mortality and long-term oncologic outcomes.
