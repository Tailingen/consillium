Changing Health Behaviors to Manage Chronic Conditions in Community-dwelling African American Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this project was to test the efficacy of partnering with a community-led wellness program to reduce disease risk and increase wellness among breast cancer survivors. Information gathered will serve the dual purpose of testing intervention effectiveness and providing the community organization data to be used to secure sustainability funding

Social and environmental issues continue to impact disease morbidity and mortality resulting in the inequities of health, wellness, and quality of life experienced by African American breast cancer survivors (AABCS) living in urban Milwaukee. AABCS outcomes in Milwaukee are significantly worse (OR=1.55) than those of Caucasian survivors.

The American Diabetes Association/American Cancer Society expert committee recommends the promotion of a healthy diet, physical activity, and weight management with low waist circumference to prevent diabetes, cancer, and obesity and to extend life expectancy. According to the National Health Interview Survey, 56% of African Americans are inactive. Yoga is one way to increase physical activity while improving wellness and health in AABCS.

The investigator's goal was to facilitate improved self-care efficacy through evidence-based integrative health and wellness strategies to help families overcome the effects of multiple negative, deep-rooted social determinants.
