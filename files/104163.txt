Oral Decitabine and Tetrahydrouridine as Epigenetic Priming for Pembrolizumab-Mediated Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Patients With Inoperable, or Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers and Esophageal Carcinomas
Background:

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Most people with lung cancer are already in the advanced stages of the disease by the time they see a doctor. Researchers want to see if combining an approved drug with two new drugs can help.

Objective:

To study if tetrahydrouridine-decitabine (THU-DAC) with pembrolizumab is safe and effective in people with non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

Eligibility:

People 18 years and older who have NSCLC that cannot be removed by surgery

Design:

Participants will be screened with

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Blood and urine tests
* Tests of heart and lung function

They may have a small tumor sample taken (biopsy). They may have tumor scans.

Before starting treatment, participants will repeat the screening tests. They will also give a stool sample.

The study will be done in 3-week cycles for up to 6 cycles.

* Participants will take the 2 study drugs by mouth 3-5 days a week.
* Participants will get pembrolizumab in a vein for 30 minutes 1 day each cycle.

Participants will keep a study medication diary.

During cycle 1, participants will have blood taken multiple times on days 1 and 2.

Every 3 cycles, participants will repeat screening tests.

Participants will have a mandatory tumor biopsy.

When they finish treatment, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests.

Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was measured using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 to determine if the combination of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine is associated with a response rate which exceeds that of Pembrolizumab alone in participants who have programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of at least 50% and those who do not. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions., Every 10 weeks (Â± 1 week) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or off study criteria is met. Longest participant on study 11 months.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Decitabine, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of participants experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first 6 weeks (two cycles) of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine therapy. If one of three patients at any given dose level experiences DLT, up to three additional patients will be treated at this dose level. If only one of six patients exhibit DLT, subsequent patients will be enrolled into the next higher dose level. As soon as two patients at any given dose level develop DLT, no additional patients will be entered at that level. Subsequent patients will be accrued into the preceding dose level; if DLT is observed in less than two of six patients treated at this lower level, this dose will represent maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A DLT is any Grade 3 or greater toxicity that cannot be attributed to a cause other than study treatment during the first two cycles of Course 1 of therapy such as disease progression or intercurrent illness., Within the first 6 weeks (two cycles)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Tetrahydrouridine, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of participants experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first 6 weeks (two cycles) of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine therapy.

Changes in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), Peripheral blood will be collected to correlate changes in circulating tumor cells with clinical response. CTCs will be assessed using ferrofluidic enrichment and multi-parameter flow cytometric detection. Baseline and post-treatment specimen collection after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)., Baseline and post-treatment after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)|Changes in Immune Cell Subsets in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), effector and exhausted cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) T cells, and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14 +) monocytes. Assessment will include functional markers, i.e., programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), cluster of differentiation 152 (CTLA-4), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) membrane heterodimeric glycoproteins (-DR) and/or cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40). Baseline and post-treatment specimen collection after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)., Baseline and post-treatment after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)|Percent Viable Tumor Cells, Portions of biopsy materials will be sent for frozen section or permanent section confirmation of malignancy, i.e., non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), esophageal carcinomas (Esc), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells, and percent viable tumor cells. All of the analyses are predicated on acquisition of sufficient materials., Baseline and post-treatment after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)|Changes in Gene, Endogenous Retroviral (ERV), Micro Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Expressions, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Methylation Signatures and Tumor Microenvironment, Tissue will be processed for focused gene, endogenous retroviral and microRNA expressions, and DNA methylation signatures using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nanostring, pyrosequencing and digital droplet PCR techniques. Isolate serum for focused methylation analysis. If sufficient tissue is available, another portion will be imbedded in paraffin for subsequent immunostaining experiments, focusing on expression of genes focusing on those proteins encoded by genes that have been identified to be clearly activated by epigenetic therapy. If sufficient materials are present, additional more comprehensive analyses including multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor microenvironment may be performed with the focus of materials from participants treated at the maximum tolerated dose. All of the analyses are predicated on acquisition of sufficient materials., Baseline and post-treatment after one course of therapy (Week 10 +/- one week)
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 2 months/10 days, 10 months/29 days, 20 months/30 days for the first, second and third group respectively.|Number of Participants With a Dose Limiting Hematologic Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is any Grade 3 (severe) or greater toxicity that cannot be attributed to a cause other than study treatment during the first two cycles of Course 1 of therapy such as disease progression or intercurrent illness., First two cycles of Course 1 of therapy
Background:

* Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) esophageal cancer (EsC) and malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) account for approximately 185,000 deaths annually in the United States, with over two thirds of patients presenting with advanced, incurable disease. 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, esophageal cancer (ESCs) or malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) produces transient responses at best, with most patients succumbing to disease within 12-16 months following diagnosis.
* Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated response rates approximating 20% in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC or EsC, and nearly 45% in patients with tumors exhibiting high level expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) following administration of pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody.
* Approximately 17% of unselected MPM patients have exhibited objective responses following administration of pembrolizumab or other PD-1 inhibitors.
* Preclinical studies have demonstrated that epigenetic drugs such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can prime cancer cells and tumor microenvironments thereby enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
* Although a potent DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine has poor bioavailability and inconsistent distribution in solid tumors due to rapid inactivation by cytidine deaminase (CDA) which is present in high levels in many organs.
* Recent studies in rodents and nonhuman primates, as well as a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT#01685515) in patients with sickle cell disease have demonstrated that oral tetrahydrouridine (THU), an inhibitor of CDA, significantly enhances bioavailability/solid-tissue-distribution of low dose oral Decitabine (DAC), thereby enhancing systemic DNA demethylation with acceptable toxicities.
* Preliminary results of recent clinical trial suggest that oral DAC-THU can increase the frequency and magnitude of responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer patients with low or absent intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression.
* These data support further evaluation of oral DAC-THU in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for therapy of thoracic malignancies.

Objectives:

Phase I

-To define pharmacokinetics, toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of oral DAC-THU in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable, or unresectable locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.

Phase II

-To determine clinical response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria to oral DAC-THU in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable, or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.

Eligibility:

Inclusion Criteria

* Male or female, 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically proven, inoperable, or unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC, EsC, or MPM.
* Measurable disease.
* Patients with high PD-L1 expression ((Bullet) 50%) and low PD-L1 expression (0-49%) in cancer cells by immunohistochemistry are eligible.
* NSCLC patients with no prior systemic treatment, or those with prior first line treatment including an immune checkpoint inhibitor are eligible for study.
* MPM patients who have received, refused, or are ineligible for first line chemotherapy are eligible.
* Patients with EsC including Seiwert-Stein Type I and Type II gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) carcinomas who have received or refused standard of care first line therapy and/or targeted therapy are eligible.
* Patients who received DNA demethylating agents or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for another malignancy may be eligible for study if there were no dose-limiting immune related events, and there has been either no clinical evidence of disease or minimal residual disease that has been stable for at least three years.
* Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies if safely accessible per PI discretion before and after treatment.
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 2.
* No evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease; adequate pulmonary reserve.
* Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function.

Exclusion Criteria

* Patients with any targetable mutation for which there is approved first, or second line therapy.
* Serious cardiovascular conditions.
* Active Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.
* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness.
* Other active infection requiring systemic therapy.
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* Patients who are receiving systemic corticosteroids.
* Patients receiving another investigational agent.
* Another malignancy.

Design:

* The Phase I component will be a standard 3+3 design combining high and low PD-L1 expressers with incremental dose escalation of oral DAC-THU to define maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
* Simon 2-stage design for Phase II studies will be used to determine clinical response at the MTD.
* Patients will receive oral DAC-THU- on T-W for two weeks out of every 3 for 9 weeks
* Pembrolizumab will be administered on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday at a fixed intravenous dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.
* One cycle is three weeks; one course is 9 weeks. Treatment evaluation using RECIST 1.1 every 10 +/- 1 weeks.
* Those patients exhibiting disease progression or unacceptable toxicities will be removed from study. Patients exhibiting stable disease or disease regression will be offered an additional course of therapy followed by treatment evaluation. Treatment will continue in this manner until off-study criteria have been met.
* Once the MTD for DAC/THU has been identified, the MTD dose level will be expanded by 4 patients to confirm its safety. Then, including these 10 patients at the MTD, a total of 10 NSCLC patients with high (50% or greater) intratumoral PD-L1 expression and 10 NSCLC patients with low (0-49%) intratumoral PD-L1 expression will be accrued to the first stage of each of two separate Phase II cohorts using individual Simon optimal designs. If 5 or more patients of the 10 first stage NSCLC patients in the high PD-L1 cohort respond to treatment, the cohort will be expanded to 23 patients. If 11 of 23 of these patients respond to treatment, the trial will be deemed positive for NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression. If 2 or more of the 10 first stage NSCLC patients in the low PD-L1 expression cohort respond to treatment, the cohort will be expanded to 29 patients. If 6 or more of these 29 patients experience a response, the trial will be deemed positive for NSCLC with low PD-L1 expression. Up to 10 EsC patients, including those considered to be part of the Phase I component after the MTD has been identified, will be enrolled into a separate cohort to examine responses to DAC-THU/pembrolizumab at the MTD. If 2 or more of these 10 EsC patients respond to treatment, these findings may warrant an amendment or a separate Phase II trial to determine response rates to DAC-THU/pembrolizumab in EsC patients. Similarly, if 2 or more of 10 MPM patients respond to treatment, these findings may warrant an amendment or a separate Phase II trial to determine response rates to DACTHU/pembrolizumab in MPM.
* Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and at treatment evaluation following the first course of therapy for analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints.
* Patients will be followed for toxicity for at least 30 days after treatment has been discontinued, start of new anti-cancer treatment or until death, whichever occurs first.
