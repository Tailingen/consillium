It scores the following domains from 0-100 where higher global or functional scores indicate increased quality of life and higher symptom scores indicate increased symptoms: Global health status (QL2), Physical functioning (PF2), Role functioning (RF2), Emotional functioning (EF), Cognitive functioning (CF), and Social functioning (SF)., Baseline at screening, cycle (C)1 day (D)8 (about 2 weeks on study), C2D8 (about 5 weeks on study), C3D8 (about 8 weeks on study), 30-day post (about 12 weeks on study)|Health Related Quality of Life as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30: Symptom Sub-Scores, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a measure of health-related quality of life for cancer patients participating in clinical trials. It scores the following domains from 0-100 where higher symptom scores indicate increased symptoms: Fatigue (FA), Nausea and vomiting (NV), Pain (PA), Dyspnea (DY), Insomnia (SL), Appetite loss (AP), Constipation (CO), Diarrhea (DI), Financial difficulties (FI), Baseline at screening, cycle (C)1 day (D)8 (about 2 weeks on study), C2D8 (about 5 weeks on study), C3D8 (about 8 weeks on study), 30-day post (about 12 weeks on study)|Health Related Quality of Life as Measured by EORTC QLQ-H&N35 Sub-Scores, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head and Neck (EORTC QLQ-H\&N35) is comprised of the following subscales, scored from 0-100 where higher scores indicate increased symptoms: Pain (HNPA), Swallowing (HNSW), Senses problem (HNSE), Speech problems (HNSP), Trouble with social eating (HNSO), Trouble with social contact (HNSC), Less sexuality (HNSX), Teeth (HNTE), Opening mouth (HNOM), Dry mouth (HNDR), Sticky saliva (HNSS), Coughing (HNCO), Felt ill (HNFI), pain killers (HNPK), Nutritional supplements (HNNU), Feeding tube (HNFE), Weight loss (HNFL), Weight gain (HNWG), Baseline at screening, cycle (C)1 day (D)8 (about 2 weeks on study), C2D8 (about 5 weeks on study), C3D8 (about 8 weeks on study), 30-day post (about 12 weeks on study)|Health Related Quality of Life as Measured by EQ-5D Participant Counts, The EQ-5D is a 5 question measure of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression plus an overall measure of health reported on a visual analog scale. Participant counts are reported for each of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, anxiety / depression., Baseline at screening, cycle (C)1 day (D)8 (about 2 weeks on study), C2D8 (about 5 weeks on study), C3D8 (about 8 weeks on study), 30-day post (about 12 weeks on study)
Expression of PD-L1 by Histology, PD-L1 expression has been shown to predict response to immunotherapy regimens. If PD-L1 expression correlates with outcome, it could be used in the future to select patients who have greatest benefit from this regimen., up to 3 months|Levels of IFN-γ Expressing and CD122+ T Cells in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), Evaluation of the in vivo immune response will help better define the mechanism of action of this combination therapy., up to 5 years|Diversity and Clonality of the T Cell Receptor Repertoire by Deep Sequencing of PBMC, Evaluation of the in vivo immune response will help better define the mechanism of action of this combination therapy., up to 5 years|Levels of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes by Histology, Evaluation of the in vivo immune response will help better define the mechanism of action of this combination therapy., up to 3 months
Following an informed consent process, participants will receive anti-PD-1 therapy with 200 mg of pembrolizumab and NKTR-214 at 0.006 mg/kg. Palliative radiation therapy will then be delivered to tumor sites causing or felt by the treating physician to have a high potential for causing symptoms with either 8 Gy X 3 or 4 Gy X 5 completed 3 to 7 days prior to cycle 2 of anti-PD1 and NKTR-214. Combined anti-PD-1 and NKTR-214 will then be delivered each subsequent cycle.

Efficacy will be measured by overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit (CB), and duration of response with ORR the primary outcome being compared to historical control data. Toxicity will be evaluated prior to administration of each 21-day cycle, while receiving NKTR-214 followed by every four months after the participant is off trial. Health related quality of life questionnaires will be completed with cycle 1 and 2 and then every 4 cycles thereafter.
