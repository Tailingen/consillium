This research study will determine if esomeprazole, when administered twice daily at 40, 80, or 120 mg doses, can control excessive stomach acid secretion.
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome
DRUG: Esomeprazole magnesium (Nexium)
To assess the gastric acid secretory rate at the final study visit.|Control is defined as gastric acid secretory rate below 10 mEq/h or below 5 meq/h for patients with prior gastric acid reducing Surgery
The status (controlled or not controlled) of gastric acid secretory rate at the Month 6 study visit.|Control is defined as gastric acid secretory rate below 10 mEq/h or below 5 meq/h for patients with prior gastric acid reducing surgery.|The following safety variables will be assessed at Month 6 and Month 12: adverse events, clinical laboratory results (ie, chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), physical examinations, and EGDs.
