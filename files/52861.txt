18F-DOPA PET Imaging: an Evaluation of Biodistribution and Safety
Single centre prospective cohort phase III study of 18F-DOPA PET/CT imaging in specific patient populations:

1. Pediatric patients with congenital hyperinsulinism
2. Pediatric patients with neuroblastoma
3. Pediatric or Adult patients with suspected extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
4. Adult patients with a clinical suspicion of Parkinson's disease
5. Pediatric or Adult patients with primary brain tumors

This study will evaluate the biodistribution and safety of 18F-DOPA produced at the Edmonton PET Centre.
Congenital Hyperinsulinism|Neuroblastoma|Neuroendocrine Tumors|Parkinson Disease|Brain Glioma
DRUG: 18F-DOPA
Immediate safety evaluation, Clinical screen for adverse reactions to 18F-DOPA injection, Within 1 hour of injection
Delayed safety evaluation, A telephone survey to evaluate for delayed adverse reactions to 18F-DOPA injection, 10-14 days after injection|Delayed safety evaluation - referring physician, Questionnaire for referring physician to screen for adverse reactions to 18F-DOPA injection, 6 months after injection|Biodistribution: scan interpreter will evaluate the distribution of tracer and comment if expected, Scan interpreter will evaluate the distribution of tracer and comment if expected, Within 3 days after injection|Perceived clinical benefit, Questionnaire for referring physician to assess perceived clinical benefit of scan, 6 months after injection
