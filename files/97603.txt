Study of C-TIL052A Cell Therapy in Advanced Cervical Cancer
A study that aimed to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of C-TIL052A cell therapy in subjects with persistent, recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (C-TIL052A) Injection
Adverse Events (AE), To characterize the safety profile and evaluate tolerability of C-TIL052A cell therapy by collecting, analyzing the treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) during and post treatment, especially the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) within 28 days post TIL infusion., up to 12 months or through study completion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with response (CR+PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), up to 12 months or through study completion|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients ever comfirmed with response or stable disease (CR+PR+SD) during the follow-up period per RECIST v1.1, up to 12 months or through study completion|Duration of Response (DOR), The time length between the first confirmed objective response to the treatment and the subsequent disease progression per RECIST 1.1, up to 12 months or through study completion|Time to Response (TTR), The time length between TIL infusion and confirmed subsequent disease progression per RECIST 1.1, up to 12 months or through study completion|Overall Survival（OS）, The time length of patients living from the date of TIL infusion, up to 12 months or through study completion|Progression Free Survival（PFS）, The time length of patients living without progression from the date of TIL infusion, up to 12 months or through study completion
For patients with advanced cervical cancer who have failed the standard treatment, no recognized alternative follow-up treatment regimens are available and the prognosis is poor. The study is a single center phase I trial planning to assess the safety, tolerability and the preliminary anti-tumor activity of C-TIL052A cell therapy in persistent, recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer. Eligible subjects will receive injection of C-TIL052A (Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, TIL) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) after lymphodepletion. All subjects will be followed up post treatment for safety and efficacy monitoring and the follow-up period will be 12 months or through study completion.
