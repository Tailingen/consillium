Understanding and Addressing Rejection of Personalized Breast Cancer Risk Information: Administrative Supplement Study
The Understanding and Addressing Rejection of Personalized Cancer Risk Information study is a longitudinal study conducted to understand the nature of phenomenon of personalized cancer risk rejection in the context of mammography screening.

BEHAVIORAL: Presentation of a personal breast cancer risk estimate
Risk rejection as measured by a numeric estimate, Participants are asked whether they agree or disagree with their Gail Model risk estimate. An open text box allows them to write the risk number that they believe is accurate for them., at baseline survey|Risk-concordant information seeking, Participants will be given the opportunity to get more information about breast cancer screening, and will be given response options to receive information for women at lower than average risk, higher than average risk, or women with risk that is "about the same as a typical woman". Concordance is measured by agreement between the participants' actual risk estimate and the option that they choose., at baseline survey|Screening intentions, Participants are asked: In the next 12 months, do you plan to get a mammogram? The question is answered on a 5-point will-will not Likert scale. 1=definitely will not, 2=probably will not, 3=maybe, 4=probably will, 5=definitely will, at baseline survey
The Understanding and Addressing Rejection of Personalized Cancer Risk Information study seeks to understand the nature of the phenomenon of personalized cancer risk rejection in the context of mammography screening by testing hypotheses about why women reject their risk estimate and the influence of rejection on screening intentions.

The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) will be used to asses participant's breast cancer risk. This model is designed to estimate breast cancer risk in women 35-84, and uses the following predictors: 1) age, 2) age at first menstrual period, 3) age at first live birth, 4) first-degree relatives with breast cancer, 5) previous breast biopsy with atypical hyperplasia, and 6) race/ethnicity. Participants will be required to complete a survey in which they receive their BCRAT model risk estimate and respond to that risk estimate.
