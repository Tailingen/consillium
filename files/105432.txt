This food-effect study plans to enroll 16 (at least 12 to complete the study) subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences (fasted or standard high-fat breakfast) at a 1:1 ratio generated from a computer. Each dosing sequence will consist of 2 cycles, with 1 dose in each cycle of the study and a washout period of at least 7 days between each dose. Study drug will be administered to subjects in the morning of each administration day of each cycle. PK, ECG, vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory tests will be performed as specified in the protocol. Tolerability and safety of the treatment will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events.
