Assessing the Efficacy of Repeat, Monthly Treatments of Alexandrite Laser for NF1-associated Cutaneous Neurofibromas (cNFs)
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the tolerability and effectiveness of multiple treatments of Alexandrite (755 nm) Laser in those with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Cutaneous Neurofibromas (cNFs). The main questions it aims to answer are:

Will performing up to 6 months of treatment sessions with alexandrite laser will result in tolerable local skin reactions and reduction in both individual cNF size by \>50% as well as improved cNF appearance in the treated field? If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare laser treatment with cooling to both laser treatment without cooling and an untreated control see if laser treatments are effective and if cooling makes treatment more tolerable.

Participants will:

* Receive up to 6 monthly laser treatments.
* Complete surveys asking about pain during and after treatments.
* Complete surveys asking about satisfaction with the treatments.
* Undergo 2D photography and 3D imaging of treatment areas.
* Optionally, receive biopsies of up to 6 treated lesions to investigate characteristics of tumors that respond well to treatment as well as non-respondent tumors.
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)|Neurofibromatosis Type I
DEVICE: GentleMax Pro (with skin cooling)|DEVICE: GentleMax Pro (without skin cooling)
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Treatment will be considered tolerable if \<40% of participants treated have a \>Grade 2 CTCAE v5 adverse event (AE)., Anytime between initiation of treatment and study completion.
Patient Global Assessment of cNF Improvement (Likert Scale), Patient rates degree of change of treated cNFs on a scale from -3 (very much worse) to 3 (very large improvement)., Baseline, Day 90, and 30 days after final treatment (up to Day 240).|Clinician Global Assessment of cNF Improvement (Likert Scale), Clinician rates degree of change of treated cNFs on a scale from -3 (very much worse) to 3 (very large improvement)., Baseline, Day 90, and 30 days after final treatment (up to Day 240).|VAS Pain Scale, Participants will be asked to rate their pain using a visual analog scale (0 to 10) at each treatment visit and 1 week after each treatment., Baseline, every 30 days (up to Day 240).|Patient Satisfaction, Satisfaction with each treatment modality is rated from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied)., Baseline, Day 90, and 30 days after final treatment (up to Day 240).|Rate of Healing, Measured clinically via photography completed by a member of the study team at baseline, and all in-person visits., Baseline, every 30 days (up to Day 240).|cNF Appearance (Height), Clinically completed 3D Cherry Imaging. Change from baseline in height of cNFs., Baseline, Day 90, and 30 days after final treatment (up to Day 240).|cNF Appearance (Volume), Clinically completed 3D Cherry Imaging. Change from baseline in volume of cNFs., Baseline, Day 90, and 30 days after final treatment (up to Day 240).
Biologic Effect/Histology, A subset of 2-6 cNFs from the treatment region will be assessed after the final treatment session., 3 months after final treatment session.
