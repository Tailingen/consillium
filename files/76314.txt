Effectiveness of Using the Speedometer During Colonoscopy
PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL

Objective:

To evaluate if the speedometer based on the real-time image analysis can help endoscopists increase their withdrawal time, which is defined as time spent examining the colon during withdrawal of the colonoscope, during colonoscopy.

Hypothesis:

The trial hypothesis is that use of the speedometer during colonoscopy will increase the average withdrawal time, which is defined as time spent examining the colon during withdrawal of the colonoscope, by 1.6 minutes, possibly increasing the performance of the participating endoscopists. Our objective is to clarify the clinical benefits of this digital tool in colonoscopy.

Endpoint: Withdrawal time difference between colonoscopies done without the speedometer (control period) and colonoscopies done with the speedometer (intervention period).
