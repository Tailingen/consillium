Primary Care Clinical Excellence Incentive Study
As part of UCLA Health's commitment to developing a premier integrated health system built on a foundation of physician-led, team-based primary care, the Department of Medicine (DOM) recently implemented a new performance based incentive plan called the Primary Care Clinical Excellence (PCCE) Incentive Plan. This incentive plan was developed to motivate providers to improve health maintenance screening rates.

The UCLA Health DOM Quality team is leading the implementation and evaluation of this new incentive plan across our primary care network. In addition, the DOM Quality team has partnered with the UCLA Anderson School of Management to study the most efficacious ways to frame and communicate performance based incentives.

Understanding the factors that motivate physicians to deliver the highest quality primary care will provide pivotal insights into the successful implementation of performance based programs nationwide. The investigators believe that physicians who receive communication built on behavioral principles will demonstrate more motivation towards and success at meeting national primary care screening guidelines.

Aggregate Focus Quality Measure order rates at the first visit, For each patient who visits a given PCP in our sample from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020, we will consider all Focus Quality Measures open at his/her first visit to the PCP, and calculate the percent of these measures ordered within 7 days following his/her first visit.

Focus Quality Measures include: Diabetes HGB A1C, Diabetes Eye Exam, Diabetes Foot Exam, Diabetes Nephropathy Monitoring, Colon Cancer Screening, Breast Cancer screening, Cervical Cancer Screening, chlamydia screening, and HPV depending on primary care specialty. These Focus Measures are based on the USPSTF primary care recommendations.

\[Note: The original intent was to run the study over an eight month period - from November 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 - but was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revised time frame includes (1) four full cycles (months) of the intervention (11/05/2019-03/03/2020) and four months prior to the experiment as a baseline period\], 9 months

This model assigns patients to a physician if they have been seen by that physician within the last 3 years. Additional patient attribution logic includes: 1) the physician with a preventive/wellness visit in the prior 1 year is attributed first, 2) if there is no preventive/wellness visit in the prior 1 year, the physician with the largest number of visits is attributed, and 3) if there is a tie in either the preventive/wellness visit or number of visit scenario, the physician with the most recent visit is attributed. Once patients are assigned using the above attribution model, patients who have at least one visit with their attributed physician from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020 will be included in our evaluation., 6 months|New Patients, For each physician, we will identify the number of new patients they have from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020., 6 months|Number of Visits, For each patient who visits a given PCP in our sample from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020, we will measure the total number of times he/she visits the PCP from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020., 6 months|Number of Open Tests, For each patient who visits a given PCP in our sample from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020, we will measure the number of open measures he/she has at the first visit as well as the total number of open measures he/she has from November 5, 2019 to March 3, 2020., 6 months
Currently, UCLA Health has 42 primary care clinics staffed with approximately 205 PCP's serving more than 300,000 patients. In order to improve health maintenance screening rates associated with the performance based program, the investigators will use a communication strategy that leverages behavioral principles to motivate providers to improve health maintenance screening rates.

The investigators will implement a three-arm experimental communication campaign that includes monthly messages. The communication strategy will utilize behavioral change theory (particularly social comparison and recognition) to improve physician performance in health maintenance quality metrics.

This study will primarily focus on one quality domain of the PCCE incentive program-Clinical Quality. Two further quality domains of the PCCE incentive program will serve as exploratory measures: Patient Experience and Professional Participation.

For the primary outcome measure and high-priority secondary outcome measures, the investigators will first evaluate whether the combination of arms 2 and 3 differs from arm 1 in terms of the measures listed in the Outcome Measures section. If this comparison is statistically significant, the investigators will next compare arms 1 vs 2. and then, if also significant, the investigators will compare arms 1 vs 3 and 2 vs 3. For the 1 vs 3 and 2 vs 3 comparisons, we will use a Holm-Bonferroni p-value correction. These comparisons of treatment arms will be performed at the patient level using a mixed effects regression model, including random physician and clinic effects to account for clustering of patients. Control variables include (1) patient baseline order rates (or completion rates depending on the outcome measure) in July-October 2019, (2) patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity, insurance plan, zip code), and (3) physician characteristics (gender, race, years practiced, years at UCLA Health). Unless otherwise specified, p-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
