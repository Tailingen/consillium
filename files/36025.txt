Surgical and Pharmacological Efficacy of Knosp Grade 0-2 Prolactinoma
The investigators carried out a multi-center comparative study, involving hospitals including the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, West China Hospital, Wenzhou First Hospital, and Li Huili Hospital. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of medication and surgery for specific subtypes of microadenomas and clearly defined macroadenomas (Knosp grades 0-2), in order to determine which is more effective and which has fewer benefits, thereby enhancing the evidence base.
