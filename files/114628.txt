Observational study to evaluate longitudinal quality of life according to standardized EORTC questionaires as well as functional outcome, oncological outcome and toxicity in patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer. Qol will be evaluated by standardized EORTC questionaires QLQ C30 and QLQ CR29. Acute and late toxicity will be assessed according to CTCAE 4.03. Oncological outcome will be assessed with regard to local and distant control, patterns of recurrence, freedom from treatment failure and overall survival. Correlations of physicians- and patients-assessed functional outcomes are planned.
