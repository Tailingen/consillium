Duvelisib Maintenance After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in T-Cell Lymphomas
The investigators hypothesize that duvelisib maintenance after autologous stem cell transplant in patients with T-cell lymphomas will be safe and well tolerated, and will improve progression free survival.
T-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Duvelisib|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw
Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS time will be calculated as the duration of time from autologous stem cell transplant (day 0) to the date of earliest progression or death, whichever occurs first., 2 years
Safety and tolerabilty as measured by number of study treatment related adverse events, -Adverse events will be assessed using CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From start of treatment through 30 days after last dose of duvelisib (estimated to be 13 months)|Safety and tolerabilty as measured by discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events, From start of treatment through 30 days after last dose of duvelisib (estimated to be 13 months)|Overall response rate (ORR), -Defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete or partial response, monitored with PET/CT scans., 100 days after transplant|Overall survival (OS), -Defined as the duration of time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death from any cause. Patients who are alive by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up., 2 years
The investigators hypothesize that duvelisib maintenance after autologous stem cell transplant in patients with T-cell lymphomas will be safe and well tolerated, and will improve progression free survival.
