Phase 1 Study in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies to Evaluate the Safety of ATOR-1017
The aim of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of ATOR-1017 when administered as repeated intravenous infusions to patients with advanced and/or refractory solid malignancies.
Solid Tumor|Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: ATOR-1017
Safety and tolerability: Adverse events (AEs) assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0, Number of participants with treatment-related AEs assessed by CTCAE v 5.0, From start of study until 28 days after last dose|Safety and tolerability: Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants with DLTs, From first dose of ATOR-1017 (Day 1) until Day 21
Pharmacokinetics: Maximum observed serum concentration of ATOR-1017 (Cmax), From start of study until end of study (28-56 days after last dose)|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Cmax, From start of study until end of study (28-56 days after last dose)|Pharmacokinetics: Area under the ATOR-1017 serum concentration-time curve (AUC), From start of study until end of study (28-56 days after last dose)|Immunogenicity: Anti-drug antibody (ADA) titer in serum, Levels of antibodies to ATOR-1017 will be evaluated, From start of study until end of study (28-56 days after last dose)|Clinical efficacy: Anti-tumor activity assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST), Computed tomography (CT) scans of tumors will be evaluated according to iRECIST, From start of study until end of study (28-56 days after last dose)
