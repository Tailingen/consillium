Local Recurrence Prediction of by Texture Analysis Derived From Positron Emission Tomography (PET / CT) Imaging of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Treated With Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT) (Retros MUMOFRAT)
The aim of this retrospective multicentric study was to develop and evaluate a prognostic FDG PET/CT radiomics signature in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT).
Identify FDG PET/CT Parameters Predictive of Local Control
Local Recurrence, accuracy, Time-to-Event measures up to 5 years
Cancer specific survival, accuracy, Time-to-Event measures up to 5 years|Distant metastasis free survival, accuracy, Time-to-Event measures up to 5 years|Recurrence free survival, accuracy, Time-to-Event measures up to 5 years|Overall survival, accuracy, Time-to-Event measures up to 5 years
