Safety and Efficacy of T-DXd vs. CDK4/6i-based ET as First-line Therapy of HR-positive and HER2-low/Ultralow Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Classified as Non-luminal Subtype
This trial studies a type of advanced breast cancer defined as hormone receptor HR-positive/HER2-negative and classified as non-luminal by gene expression profiling (PAM50). Patients will be treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) or with physician's choice of CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) plus endocrine therapy (ET). The main purpose of the study is to analyze the efficacy of T-DXd in patients who have HR-positive and HER2-low/ultralow advanced breast cancer classified as non-luminal subtype.

This is an international, multicenter, two-arm, randomized, phase II clinical trial for patients with unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic HR-positive and HER2-low/ultralow breast cancer classified as non-luminal by gene expression profiling. Female or male patients ≥ 18 years of age with HR-positive and HER2-low/ultralow locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer classified as non-luminal subtype by central PAM50 analysis will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg body weight administered as an IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or physician's choice of CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy. The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that first-line T-DXd compared with CDK4/6i plus ET is superior in prolonging the progression free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment in patients with HR-positive, HER2-low advanced breast cancer classified as non-luminal by central PAM50 analysis (HER2-low population) and all patients.
