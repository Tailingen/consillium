A Study of KN046 in Patients With Thymic Carcinoma Who Failed Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the study drug KN046 in patients with advanced thymic carcinoma who progressed after prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Thymic Carcinoma
DRUG: KN046
Anti-tumor Activity of KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Determined by Subject Disease Response Rate Defined by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria., Disease response rate, Up to 8 weeks
Safety of KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Measured by the Number of Adverse Events That Occur in Subjects While Receiving Study Treatment., Up to 8 weeks|Tolerability of KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Measured by the Severity of Adverse Events That Occur in Subjects While Receiving Study Treatment, Assessed Using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0., AEs are graded using the following criteria using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events v5.0:

Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.

Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.

Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.

Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.

Grade 5: Death related to AE., Up to 8 weeks|Duration of Response for KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Determined by Subject Disease Response Rate Defined by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria., Up to 8 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS) for KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Determined by Subject Disease Response Rate Defined by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria., Up to 8 weeks|Overall Survival (OS) for KN046 in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma, Determined by Subject Disease Response Rate Defined by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria., Up to 8 weeks
Patients will receive KN046 intravenously at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression or excessive toxicity for up to to two years, with the goal of this trial to contribute to the development of active and well tolerated treatments for patients who have progressed on prior treatment therapies.

Recently, molecules that combine PD-1 and CTLA-4 have been developed for patients with lung cancer, with the hope that targeted therapy will be more effective than standard of care therapies. KN046 is believed to be less toxic than other targeted therapies with an assumption that the whole molecule can actively target tumor tissue for a much higher affinity of the anti-PD-L1 portion and a weaker affinity for anti-CTLA-4, leading to less autoimmune disorders and toxicities for patients than seen with other targeted therapies.
