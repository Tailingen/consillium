Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Radiation With Cetuximab or Cisplatin in Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel-cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with cetuximab or weekly cisplatin in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

Progression-free survival, The time from date of randomization until date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years., up to 3 years
Overall survival, The time from date of randomization until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years., up to 3 years|Locoregional recurrence-free survival, The time from date of randomization until date of first documented disease recurrence at a locoregional site, assessed up to 3 years., up to 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, The time from date of randomization until date of first documented distant metastasis, assessed up to 3 years., up to 3 years|Number of participants with hematologic toxicity events occurred during two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to CTCAE v4.0, 1, 2, 3 weeks post-dose|Number of participants with acute toxicities (hematologic toxicity events, oral mucositis, acne-like rash) occurred during the concurrent treatment according to CTCAE v4.0, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 weeks|Number of participants with late toxicities (hematologic toxicity events, dysphagia, acne-like rash) occurred from 3 months after completion of radiotherapy to last follow-up visit according to CTCAE v4.0, Every 3 months during the first 2 years, then every 6 months during year 3 after completion of radiotherapy|Score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Core 35 (EORTC QLQ-HN35) during the concurrent treatment, QoL score will be documented on each weekend during the course of radiotherapy, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 weeks|Score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Core 35 (EORTC QLQ-HN35) at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, At 3 months after completion of radiotherapy
Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. A phase â…¡ study conducted by Hui et al. showed that neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy was superior to the standard concomitant chemoradiation in terms of the 3-year OS without significantly exacerbating the acute toxicities. Moreover, Bonner et al. demonstrated that RT with concurrent Cetuximab significantly improved the 5-year OS and did not increase the treatment induced toxicities when compared with RT alone. Therefore, we initiated this study to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with cetuximab or weekly cisplatin for locally advanced NPC.
