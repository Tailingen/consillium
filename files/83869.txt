Safety and Efficacy of Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab or Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of lapatinib plus trastuzumab compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free survival, tumour response and overall survival.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lapatinib plus trastuzumab
6 month progression-free-survival-rate (PFS6), The primary outcome measure for this study is:

â€¢ The 6-month PFS-rate (PFS6) The 6-month PFS-rate (PFS6) will be the number of patients without disease progression or death within 6 months from the date of randomization, divided by the number of patients in the respective analysis population. For the purpose of the analysis patients who are lost to follow-up or deceased in at or before 6 months after randomization will be counted as "disease progression"., 6 months - from the date of randomization
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression (as assessed by the site radiologist and/or investigator, using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST1.1)) or death on study from any cause (defined as death within 30 days of the last study treatment), whichever occurs first. Data for patients who experienced no progress or who are lost to follow-up will be treated as censored on the last date the patient was known to be progression free., the complete duration of the study (up to 72 months)
This is an open-label, randomized, explorative phase II trial of lapatinib plus trastuzumab or lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The trial is designed to obtain some evidence wether chemotherapy-free combined HER2-directed therapy with lapatinib and trastuzumab provides a similar efficacy as the established combination of lapatinib with capecitabine and a more favourable toxicity profile. This study will also assess the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour activity of the treatment regimens and biological characteristics of subjects' tumour at baseline.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of lapatinib plus trastuzumab compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free survival, tumour response and overall survival.

The purpose of this study ist further

* to characterize the safety and tolerability of lapatinib plus trastuzumab in this population.
* to identify predictors of sensitivity to lapatinib and trastuzumab therapy. and
* to compare the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQL) and pain symptoms for patients by treatment assignment.
