Trastuzumab & Pertuzumab Followed by T-DM1 in MBC
In HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab based treatment is the standard of care as long as there are no contraindications to trastuzumab. Frequently, trastuzumab is being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However, since therapy with trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC, the optimal treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression, chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further line therapies are performed according to the physician's discretion. If this new therapeutic strategy is as effective and better tolerated than the conventional strategy, this would mean a serious breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

-To evaluate the efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) at 24 months of a chemotherapy-free dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (first-line) followed by T-DM1 (second-line) and of a chemotherapy-containing dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (first-line) followed by T-DM1 (second-line) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Secondary

* To evaluate other efficacy parameter
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the two treatment strategies
* To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL)
* To learn how patients are treated after trial treatment

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor status (positive vs negative), prior trastuzumab (never or \>12 months vs ≤12 months after last infusion), visceral metastases (present vs absent) and site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
