Feasibility Study of Biomarkers of Response to Neoadjuvant Paclitaxel in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigators are able to locate and measure certain characteristics in breast cancer tumors that have been treated with paclitaxel that may correlate to how well the cancer will respond to the chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: tumor biopsy and blood draw
Determine feasibility of measuring biomarkers in breast tumors 20 hours after administration of the first dose of paclitaxel chemotherapy., 1 year
Measure drug levels in breast tumors 20 hours after administration of paclitaxel, 1 year|Determine feasibility of correlating drug levels with biomarkers including mitotic index, aneuploidy, and Ki67, 1 year|Determine feasibility of correlating pathologic response and clinical response with biomarkers including mitotic index, aneuploidy, and Ki67., 1 year|Determine the feasibility of obtaining circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for analysis including evaluation for mitosis., 1 year|Compare biomarkers from tissue samples obtained 20 hours after administration of paclitaxel with tissue obtained at the time of surgery., 1 year
