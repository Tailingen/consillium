A Phase I/II Study of Mitoxantrone Liposome Combined With Chidamide in Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a highly heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) originating from mature thymus T cells.Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection can accelerate the entry of mitoxantrone into cells, reduce the efflux of mitoxantrone, ensure the concentration of intracellular drugs, reverse the drug resistance mechanism, and enhance anti-tumor activity.We will explore the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection combined with Chidamide in the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, and determine the phase II recommended dose RP2D.In the phase II study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination regimen.
Relapsed and Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Mitoxantrone liposome combine with Chidamide
RP2D, Phase II recommended dose, 24 months|ORR, Objective remission rate, 24 months
MTD, Maximum tolerated dose, 24 months|DLT, Dose-limiting toxicity, 24 months|DOR, Duration of remission time, 24 months
This study was a single-arm, open, multicenter phase I/II clinical study. An estimated 87 to 96 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL will be enrolled. This program is divided into two parts:

The phase I study is expected to enroll 9 to 18 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL who will be treated with Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection combined with Chidamide.The phase II study is expected to enroll 78 patients.
