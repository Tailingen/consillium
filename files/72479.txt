A Study of Oral IRAK-4 Inhibitor CA-4948 in Combination With Pembrolizumab and Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases
This phase I/II trial will investigate the use of the novel oral IRAK-4 inhibitor CA-4948 in combination with pembrolizumab therapy following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM). The investigators hypothesize that the addition of CA-4948 will reduce the rate of distant intracranial failure and reduce the need for subsequent radiation therapy. The investigators also propose that it will have a significant reduction in radiation necrosis and improve patient-reported symptoms and quality of life. This trial represents the first time an oral IRAK-4 inhibitor has been used in combination with aPD1 therapy in MBM and will yield valuable insight into its synergistic potential both in MBM and additional sites of metastases.

Reduction in need for repeated intercranial intervention 1 year after initial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), Determine if the combination of CA-4948 and pembrolizumab reduces the need for repeated intercranial intervention 1 year after initial SRS, as measured by remaining free from need for repeated intracranial intervention 1 year after initial SRS (surgery, SRS, laser interstitial thermal therapy, or whole brain radio-therapy)., 1 year
Intracranial objective response rate, Determine the intracranial objective response rate, as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, 2 years|Systemic objective response rate, Determine the systemic objective response rate, as measured by iRECIST criteria, 2 years|Radiation necrosis-free survival at 1 year, 1 year|Overall survival, Determine the overall survival of patients with melanoma brain metastases treated with CA-4948 and pembrolizumab, 2 years
