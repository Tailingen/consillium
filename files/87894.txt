IN10018 in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy in High-grade Serous Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This is a phase Ib/II, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activities of IN10018 in combination with standard chemotherapy in subjects with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneum cancer, collectively defined as ovarian cancer).

Study will evaluate IN10018 in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in subjects with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. All the subjects will receive combination therapy until documented progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
