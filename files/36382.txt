A Single-Arm Phase II Clinical Study of Pemigatinib in the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With FGFR Alterations Who Have Failed Standard Therapy
This study is a prospective single-arm phase II clinical study. Advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with FGFR 1-3 alterations (including but not limited to FGFR amplification, rearrangement/fusion, mutation, etc.) who have failed standard therapy will be enrolled in this study once they have signed the informed consent form (ICF) and been identified as eligible in screening.
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemigatinib
objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) + those with partial response (PR) according to the RECIST1.1 criteria., an expected average of 2 years
This study is a prospective single-arm phase II clinical study. Advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with FGFR 1-3 alterations (including but not limited to FGFR amplification, rearrangement/fusion, mutation, etc.) who have failed standard therapy will be enrolled in this study once they have signed the informed consent form (ICF) and been identified as eligible in screening. The patients will receive 13.5 mg of pemigatinib once a day (QD) orally following a 2-week administration/1-week interruption regimen. They will be dosed until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. During treatment, clinical tumor imaging evaluation will be performed according to RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks (± 7 days) and then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) after week 48. Safety will be assessed according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0.
