Phase Ib Study of the Safety of T-DXd and Immunotherapy Agents With and Without Chemotherapy in Advanced or Metastatic HER2+, Non-squamous NSCLC
DESTINY-Lung03 will investigate the safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan in combination with Immunotherapy Agents with and without chemotherapy in patients with HER2 over-expressing non-small cell lung cancer. The efficacy will be also analyzed as a secondary endpoint.

DRUG: T-DXd|BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Volrustomig|DRUG: Rilvegostomig
Frequency of AEs and SAEs, Occurrence of AEs and SAEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Safety and tolerability (and to determine RP2D) will be assessed for approximately 20 months from informed consent
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1 is the percentage of patients with Complete Response or Partial Response that is subsequently confirmed, based on investigator assessment, An average of approximately 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death, based on RECIST 1.1 assessment, An average of approximately 20 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the percentage of patients who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), based on RECIST 1.1 assessment. DCR is assessed at 6 and 12 weeks, An average of approximately 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is the time from first dose of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death, based on RECIST 1.1 assessment, An average of approximately 20 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time form the date of first dose of study treatment until death due to any cause, An average of approximately 20 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed by the serum concentration of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and MAAA-1181 in all arms, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody and MAAA-1181a, An average of approximately 20 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed by the serum concentration of durvalumab in study arms including T-DXd in combination with durvalumab, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for durvalumab, including T-DXd in combination with durvalumab, An average of approximately 20 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed by the serum concentration of volrustomig in study arms including T-DXd in combination with volrustomig, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for volrustomig, including T-DXd in combination with volrustomig, An average of approximately 20 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed by the serum concentration of rilvegostomig in study arms including T-DXd in combination with rilvegostomig, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for rilvegostomig, including T- DXd in combination with rilvegostomig, An average of approximately 20 months|The immunogenicity of T-DXd, durvalumab, volrustomig and rilvegostomig assessed by the presence of ADAs for T-DXd, durvalumab, volrustomig, or rilvegostomig, Individual participant data and descriptive statistics will be provided for data at each time point for each dose level for T-DXd, durvalumab or volrustomig, or rilvegostomig, An average of approximately 20 months
Part 1 is a dose escalation study by design, allowing the assessment of safety, tolerability and recommended dose levels of the combination of T-DXd and durvalumab plus cisplatin, carboplatin or pemetrexed. No more patients will be enrolled in this part of the study. Part 2, expansions in the treatment naïve setting on any recommended dose level will not be initiated. The evaluation of T-DXd combination treatment with immunotherapy continues in Part 3 and Part 4, assessing T-DXd and volrustomig with carboplatin (Arm 3B) or without carboplatin (Arm 3A) and T-Dxd and rilvegostomig with carboplatin (Arm 4B) or without carboplatin (Arm 4A).

For Part 3, patients will be randomized to Arms 3A and 3B, beginning with the cohorts receiving the volrustomig starting dose (SD). A total of 6 DLT-evaluable patients will be enrolled to the SD cohorts in each arm. If the combination of T-DXd with volrustomig at the starting dose is deemed safe, a dose escalation (E1) cohort will be opened for 6 DLT-evaluable patients. Once all open dose confirmation cohorts have 6 DLT-evaluable patients, the SRC will convene to select the volrustomig RP2D to be used in the dose-expansion (DE) cohorts of each arm (n=34).

In Part 4, once a total of 6 DLT-evaluable patients/arm have been enrolled into Arm 4A and Arm 4B safety-run in (SR) cohorts and deemed safe, an additional 34 patients per arm will be enrolled in Arms 4A and 4B in dose expansion cohorts.

The target population of interest (for Part 3 and Part 4) are patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria, HER2 overexpression, ECOG PS of 0 to 1, patients who are treatment naïve for recurrent, unresectable or metastatic disease. Patients with tumors that harbor a known genomic alteration or driver for which approved therapies are available are excluded.
