Relationship Between Serum N/OFQ and Acute Myeloid Cell Leukemia
Patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University were selected and divided into the newly diagnosed group, the relapsed group, the complete remission group as the experimental group, and the healthy physical examination subjects as the control group. The relationship between IL-1β, catecholamine and norkephalin in peripheral blood of the experimental group and the control group was observed. According to the literature, the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group. In the experimental group, the newly diagnosed group was higher than the relapse group, and the relapse group was higher than the complete remission group, and the correlation was positive, and the difference was statistically significant.
