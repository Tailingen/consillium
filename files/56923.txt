A Phase 3 Trial of Brentuximab Vedotin(SGN-35) Versus Physician's Choice (Methotrexate or Bexarotene) in Participants With CD30-Positive Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (ALCANZA Study)
The purpose of this study is to determine objective response rate (ORR), lasting at least 4 months (ORR4), with brentuximab vedotin in participants with cluster of differentiation antigen 30 positive (CD30+) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma \[mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) \]compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm.
Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Mycosis Fungoides|Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Bexarotene
Percentage of Participants Achieving an Objective Response That Lasts at Least 4 Months (ORR4), ORR4 was determined by an Independent Review Facility (IRF) based on Global Response Score (GRS) which consisted of a skin assessment by the investigator using the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT), nodal and visceral radiographic assessment by an IRF and for the participants with mycosis fungoides (MF) only, detection of circulation Sezary cells. Participants whose first response occurred after the start of subsequent anticancer therapy were excluded. Response Criteria was based on International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL), United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC) and Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force (CLTF) of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Consensus guidelines (Olsen, 2011)., Each Cycle until disease progression, death End of treatment (Median overall follow-up 38.8 months)
Percentage of Participants Achieving a CR, Complete Response (CR) was determined by the IRF based on Global Response Score (GRS) which consisted of a skin assessment by the investigator using the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT), nodal and visceral radiographic and for the participants with mycosis fungoides (MF) only, detection of circulation Sezary cells. Response Criteria was based on ISCL, USCLC and CLTF of the EORTC Consensus guidelines (Olsen, 2011)., Each Cycle until disease progression, death or data cutoff (Median overall follow-up 38.8 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was assessed by the IRF and is defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was based on ISCL, USCLC and CLTF of the EORTC Consensus guidelines (Olsen, 2011)., Until disease progression, death or data cutoff (Median PFS follow-up of 38.8 months)|Maximum Change From Baseline in Symptom Domain Score of the Skindex-29 Questionnaire, Skindex-29 is a 29-item dermatology-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The Skindex-29 incorporates a 28-day recall period and consists of 3 domains: symptoms, emotions, and functioning. The domain scores and an overall score are expressed on a 100-point scale, from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating lower levels of health- HRQoL. A negative change (reduction) from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline up to End of Treatment (Week 52)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response was assessed by the IRF in participants with confirmed response \[CR or Partial Response (PR)\] and is defined as the time between first documentation of response and disease progression. Response Criteria was based on ISCL, USCLC and CLTF of the EORTC Consensus guidelines (Olsen, 2011)., Until disease progression, death or data cutoff (Median follow-up 38.8 months)|DOR of Skin Response, Duration of skin response (CR and PR) was assessed by the investigator and is defined as the time between the first skin response to progressive disease in skin. Per mSWAT, CR is defined as 100% clearance of skin lesions. PR is defined as 50%-99% clearance of skin disease from Baseline; No new tumors in participants without tumors at Baseline -MF; No new tumors-primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL).Progressive disease is defined as â‰¥ 25% increase in skin disease from baseline, or loss of response: in those with CR or PR, increase of skin score of greater than the sum of nadir plus 50% baseline score, or new tumors in participants without tumors at baseline (MF)., Until disease progression, death or data cutoff (Median follow-up 38.8 months)|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS was assessed by the IRF and is defined as the time from randomization until any cause of treatment failure: disease progression, discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was based on ISCL, USCLC and CLTF of the EORTC Consensus guidelines (Olsen, 2011)., From randomization until disease progression, death or data cutoff (Median follow-up 36.8 months)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Concentration for Brentuximab Vedotin, Day 1 pre-dose and 30 minutes after infusion in Cycles 1 and 3|Ctrough: Observed Concentration at the End of a Dosing Interval for Brentuximab Vedotin, Day 1 pre-dose of Cycles 2 and 4|Cmax: Maximum Observed Concentration for Monomethyl Auristatin (MMAE) for Brentuximab Vedotin, Day 1 pre-dose and 30 minutes after infusion ended in Cycles 1 and 3|Ctrough: Observed Concentration at the End of a Dosing Interval for MMAE for Brentuximab Vedotin, Day 1 pre-dose of Cycles 2 and 4|Number of Participants With Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA) to Brentuximab Vedotin, Blood was collected and evaluated for ATA and neutralizing ATA in all participants who received brentuximab vedotin to assess immunogenicity., Baseline up to End of Treatment (Week 52)|Change From Baseline in the Skindex-29 Questionnaire Total Score, Skindex-29 is a 29-item dermatology-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The Skindex-29 incorporates a 28-day recall period and consists of 3 domains: symptoms, emotions, and functioning. The domain scores and an overall score are expressed on a 100-point scale, 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating lower levels of health- HRQoL. A negative change (reduction) from Baseline indicates improvement., Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, at End of Treatment (EOT) and during posttreatment long treatment follow-up (LTFU) - (Median follow-up 38.8 months)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Questionnaire (FACT-G) Score, FACT-G is a 27-item general cancer QOL instrument completed by participants receiving cancer treatment. FACT-G incorporates a 7-day recall period and contains 4 primary subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; sum of 7 items, point range 0-28); Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, sum of 7-items, point range 0-28); Emotional Well-Being (EWB; sum of 6-items, point range 0-24); Functional Well-Being (FWB; sum of 7-items, point range 0-28); Fact-G total score=sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, point range 0-108. Higher scores for the total scales and subscales indicate better quality of life. A negative change (reduction) from Baseline indicates improvement., Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, at EOT and during posttreatment (LTFU) - (Median follow-up 38.8 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs and SAEs were assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event., First dose of study drug through 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to 450 days)
The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is being tested to treat people who have CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma). This study will look at the overall response of people who took brentuximab vedotin compared to people who took methotrexate or bexarotene as standard care.

The study enrolled 131 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

* Methotrexate 5 to 50 mg or Bexarotene 300 mg/m\^2 (as per physician's choice)
* Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg

This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 6 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic every 12 weeks for a minimum of 24 months after the end of treatment (EOT) visit, and then every 6 months until death, study closure, or 6 years after enrollment of the last participant.
