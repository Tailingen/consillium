Phase 2 Study of OTL38 for Intra-operative Imaging of Folate Receptor-alpha Positive Ovarian Cancer
This study is being done to:

* test the safety of OTL38
* see if OTL38 helps light up the cancer when viewed with the special camera system
* test the safety of the special camera system for use along with OTL38 during surgery
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: OTL38|DEVICE: Near infrared camera imaging system|PROCEDURE: Laparotomy
Sensitivity of OTL38 in Detecting Folate Receptor-alpha Positive Ovarian Cancer During Surgery., Sensitivity for the detection of folate receptor-alpha positive (FRAP) ovarian cancer lesions is defined as the ratio (multiplied by 100) of the number of FRAO ovarian cancer lesions confirmed by both fluorescent light and the pathology/ and immunohistochemistry lab (TP) over the number of FRAP ovarian cancer lesions confirmed by the pathology/ and immunohistochemistry lab (TP+FN). 95% lower one-sided confidence interval was used., Day of Surgery (Day 1)|Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of OTL38 in Detecting Folate Receptor-alpha Positive Ovarian Cancer During Surgery., PPV for the detection of FRAP ovarian cancer lesions is defined as the ratio (multiplied by 100) of the number of FRAP ovarian cancer lesions confirmed by both fluorescent light and the pathology/ and immunohistochemistry lab (TP) over the number of FRAP ovarian cancer lesions confirmed by fluorescent light (TP + FP).

95% lower one-sided confidence interval was used., Day of Surgery (Day 1)
This study is being done to:
