A Phase I/II Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Vaccinations With Allogeneic Dendritic Cells: Autologous Tumor-Derived Cells Subjected to Electrofusions in Patients With AJCC Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study will look how using taken from your tumors and mixed with special immune stimulating cells from another person's blood in given back to you in a series "fusion cell" injections, will effect your body. The primary goal of the study is to see if giving the experimental fusion cell injections is safe. We will also be looking to see what effect the experimental treatment as on your immune system and whether it has an effect on your cancer.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Electrofusion DC vaccine
To assess the safety of 3 serial vaccinations with allogeneic DCs: autologous tumor-derived cells subjected to electrofusion in patients with AJCC stage IV RCC, screening/baseline, treatment period, follow-up and long-term follow-up
To determine if 3 serial vaccinations of allogeneic DCs: autologous tumor-derived cells subjected to electrofusion will induce a clinical response as assessed by tumor response and will induce an immune response., screening/baseline, treatment period, follow-up and long-term follow-up
Patients undergo tumor aquisition and short-term tumor cell cultures are established. Leukopheresis is performed monocyte-derived DC are generated ex-vivo by standard culture techniques, utilizing GM-CSF and Il-4. PEG fusions are generated, and following irradiation, the vaccine is frozen. The thawed vaccine is administered SC into a single site every three weeks. Each study is examining a dose-escalating strategy based apon the number PEG-fused generated from the PEG process that expressed both tumor cell and DC markers as determined by immune staining.
