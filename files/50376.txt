CKD-581 + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone in Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma
This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and recommened phase 2 dose(RP2D) based on dose limiting toxicity(DLT), and to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in patients with Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma.

This is an open label, dose escalation study. Cohort of 3\~6 patients receive escalation doses of CKD-516 until the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
