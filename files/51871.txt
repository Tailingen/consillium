Safety and Efficacy of RC-1291 HCl in Patients With Cancer Related Anorexia and Weight Loss
Anorexia and weight loss are devastating complications in late-stage cancer patients and is strongly associated with mortality in these patients. Activation of Ghrelin receptors have been demonstrated to stimulate appetite. RC-1291 HCl, by virtue of its ghrelin like activity and Growth Hormone releasing effects may have a dual role in the reversal of cancer induced anorexia and weight loss. This study will test the safety and efficacy of RC-1291 in the treatment of cancer patients with anorexia and weight loss.
