Effects of Two Doses of MPX Capsules on Rising Prostate-specific Antigen Levels in Men Following Initial Therapy for Prostate Cancer
This research is being done to test an investigational product called Muscadine Plus in the treatment of men who have received initial therapy (surgery and or radiation, cryotherapy or brachytherapy) for prostate cancer and are experiencing a rise in their prostate-specific antigens (PSA) level.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Muscadine Plus Grape Skin Extract|DRUG: Low-dose MPX|DRUG: High-dose MPX|DRUG: Placebo oral capsule
(Phase I) Maximum Tolerated Dose, To determine the recommended dosing for Muscadine Plus and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Muscadine Plus in prostate cancer patients with rising PSA following definitive therapy., Up to 7 months post-intervention|(Phase II) Prostate Specific Antigen Doubling Time (PSADT), To define the effects of placebo and two different daily doses of MPX on PSADT in men who have rising PSA after initial definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer., Change from baseline to month 12
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events reported verbally by patient and documented in study notes., At month 12 post-intervention|(Phase II) Proportion of Men Whose PSADT Increases Greater Than 33%, At month 12 post-intervention|(Phase II) Number of Men With Greater Than 50% Reduction in PSA Compared to Baseline, Change in PSA values drawn over study period, taken every 3 months. PSA is measured in ng/mL, At month 12 post-intervention
In phase I the investigators are evaluating the safety of the product and checking blood levels of the active components. In phase II the investigators are evaluating the effect of MPX on PSA doubling time
