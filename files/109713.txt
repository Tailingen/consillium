The Effect of Deep Versus Moderate Muscle Relaxants in Men During and After Robotic Surgery for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in intra-abdominal pressure which surgeons use during surgery and post-surgery pain in men who undergo robotic prostate surgery with deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB), compared with moderate NMB.

Difference in levels of Intra-Abdominal Pressure (IAP) when performing robotic prostatectomy in participants under a moderate vs deep Neuromuscular Blockade technique, Measured by continuous Intra-abdominal Pressure monitor in mmHg, 1 year|Difference in levels of postoperative pain in participants under a moderate vs deep Neuromuscular Blockade technique during robotic prostatectomy using the pain numeric pain scale (NPS)., Difference in levels of postoperative pain in participants under a moderate vs deep Neuromuscular Blockade technique during robotic prostatectomy using the pain numeric pain scale (NPS). The numeric pain scale (NPS) is a subjective measure which can be used in recovery rooms to assist in the assessment of pain. Individuals rate their pain on an eleven-point scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain)., 1 year
