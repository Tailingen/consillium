A Phase 2 Trial of MP0250 Plus Bortezomib + Dexamethasone in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and efficacy of MP0250 in combination with bortezomib + dexamethasone in patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM).

MP0250 is a multi-DARPin® drug candidate with three specificities, able to simultaneously neutralize the activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and also to bind to human serum albumin (HSA) to give an increased plasma half-life and potentially enhanced tumor penetration.
