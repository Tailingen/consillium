The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Hemay181 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to explore the maximum tolerated dose. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of Hemay181 in patients with advanced solid tumors and to evaluate the preliminary evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy of Hemay181.

The study will be conducted in two parts. Part one, trial will be conducted in about 24 subjects to determine safety and tolerability of Hemay181 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Part two, approximately 15-27 additional subjects with advanced solid tumors are included to better define the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Hemay181.
