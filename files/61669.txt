Everolimus, Rituximab, and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cells in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Giving everolimus together with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of everolimus when given together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate and prednisone) chemotherapy.
* To assess the feasibility of everolimus in combination with standard R-CHOP chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Secondary

* To describe the toxicities associated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.
* To further describe the toxicities associated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.
* To assess the rate of event-free survival (EFS) at 12 months for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.
* To evaluate overall response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, EFS, overall survival, and progression-free survival for patients treated with everolimus in combination with R-CHOP chemotherapy.

Tertiary

* To profile gene expression using immunohistochemistry and categorize patients as germinal-center B-cell-like (GBC) vs activated B-cell-like (ABC) vs unclassified lymphoma subtype. (exploratory)
* To determine whether previously identified predictive markers in large cell lymphoma remain valid with the addition of everolimus to R-CHOP chemotherapy. (exploratory)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a feasability expanded-cohort study.

Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10 or 1-14; rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-60 minutes, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1; and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumor biopsies are collected for laboratory studies and patients may undergo blood and needle biopsy sample collection for correlative studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.
