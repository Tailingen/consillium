Comparison of Harmonic Scalpel to Conventional Diathermy in Perforator Flap Elevation for Head and Neck Reconstruction
This study is to compare the efficacy of Harmonic Scalpel with conventional diathermy technique in terms of reducing elevation time and perioperative complications of perforator flaps for head and neck reconstruction.
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Diathermy|PROCEDURE: Harmonic Scalpel
flap elevation time: from identification of skin perforator to completion of dissection to main pedicle, 1 hour after completion of flap elevation
intraoperative complications: bleeding, perforator injury (thermal, mechanical), 1 hour after completion of flap elevation|postoperative drainage amount, 1 week after flap inset|postoperative pain measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), 1 week after completion of flap elevation
