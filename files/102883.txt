Treatment of Prostate Cancer With Adjuvant Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab plus erlotinib following radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib + Bevacizumab
To Evaluate the Efficacy of Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib, Determined by time to tumor recurrence, as measured by rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy.|Time to Tumor Recurrence, Tumor progression assessed every 3 months during Follow-up Period for a maximum of 3 years after administration of first study treatment
Time to Tumor Progression., Measured once for participants who experienced tumor recurrence per protocol. Imaging done to measure tumor progression only after documented tumor recurrence, Tumor progression assessed every 3 months during Follow-up Period for a maximum of 3 years after administration of first study treatment|Overall Survival, Survival status was assessed every 3 months after completion of study treatment for a maximum of 3 years after administration of first study treatment
This study explores the anti-tumor activity of adjuvant bevacizumab plus erlotinib in a select group of prostate cancer patients deemed at high risk for early relapse following radical prostatectomy.
