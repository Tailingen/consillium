Study of Erlotinib With or Without Investigational Drug (CS-7017) in Subjects With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase 2 and open-label (subject will know the treatment he or she is receiving) study. The subject will receive either Erlotinib alone or Erlotinib + CS-7017 in this study.

The study will determine what effect adding CS-7017 to Erlotinib has on safety and length of survival in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed the first treatment.
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: CS-7017|DRUG: erlotinib
Summary of Analysis of Progression-Free Survival Following Administration of CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First Line Therapy, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, whichever comes first., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to approximately 2.5 years
Analysis of Overall Survival Following Administration of CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First Line Therapy, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Baseline to death, up to approximately 2.5 years|Overall Response Rate Following Administration of CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First Line Therapy, The overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR); ORR = CR + PR. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions, CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline to disease progression or death, up to approximately 2.5 years|Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Occurring in â‰¥10% of Participants Following Administration of CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First Line Therapy, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date on or after the first dose of CS-7017 or erlotinib up to and including 30 days after the last dose of any study drug, or worsened in severity after the first dose of CS-7017 or erlotinib relative to the pre-treatment state., Baseline to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 2.5 years
