ARN 509 Plus Everolimus in Men With Progressive Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer After Treatment With Abiraterone Acetate
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the combination of apalutamide plus everolimus at different dose levels.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: apalutamide|DRUG: Everolimus
safety, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0 (CTCAE). Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests throughout the conduct of the study., 2 years|pharmacokinetics, Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC(INF), AUC(TAU), will be derived from blood to obtain everolimus concentration or plasma to obtain apalutamide and it's major metabolite concentration versus time data for patients in the dose escalation cohorts., 2 years|maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The first phase of the study will examine the safety of apalutamide in combination with everolimus in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Up to 2 dose levels will be tested. A standard "3 plus 3" dose escalation rule will be used in order to determine the MTD/RP2D. Patients will be treated in cohorts of three and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. The MTD is defined as the highest dose with an observed incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in no more than one out of six patients treated at a particular dose level., 2 years
anti-tumor activity, Tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment will be collected to evaluate for downstream indicators of PI3K pathway modulation, including pS6K, p4EBP1, pAKT, AR, PHLLP 1 and 2, and additional pathways of interest if safe and feasible per treating investigator. In lieu of biopsy, if a patient is having an elective or clinical resection/surgery and tissue is already being removed, some of that tissue may be collected for research purposes to fulfill the biopsy requirement for that timepoint. These biomarkers will be measured at baseline and cycle 2 and after treatment to explore the association between changes in the tumor biomarkers and progression-free survival., 2 years
