Investigation of PSMA PET/CT as an Imaging Biomarker in Solid Tumors
multi-centre, prospective, diagnostic trial to evaluate the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA-antigen) over-expression in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and in advanced/metastatic solid tumors patients.

Multi-centre, prospective, diagnostic trial to evaluate the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA-antigen) over-expression in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and in advanced/metastatic solid tumors patients.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the detection rate of PSMA PET/CT, defined as the ratio of PSMA-positive patients and the total number of cancer patients with known advanced/metastatic disease that performed a PSMA PET/CT as part of the present study. A positive patient is defined as a patient with at least one PSMA-positive lesion.
