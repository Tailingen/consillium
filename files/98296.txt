Study of Pembrolizumab and Concurrent Radiation in Patients With Previously Treated Carcinoma of Unknown Primary
Single-arm phase 2 study to examine pembrolizumab and concurrent radiation to induce an abscopal effect in patients with previously treated carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP16-268)
Carcinoma, Unspecified Site
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation Therapy
Abscopal Response Rate, Evaluate the abscopal response rate in Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) patients treated with the combination of pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Best abscopal response is defined as the frequency of patients whose best responding abscopal lesion demonstrates at least a 30% decrease in its longest diameter from baseline (Golden et al., 2015)., From Cycle 3, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) (C3D1) until death or up to a maximum of 19 months
Response Rate, To determine the response rate by RECIST 1.1 and informed by irRECIST, of non-irradiated metastatic sites when pembrolizumab is combined with radiotherapy. Subjects with confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 should be considered.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until death or up to a maximum of 19 months|Evaluate Treatment-related Toxicity., The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be summarized using CTCAE version 4.0 criteria. The frequency and percentage of grade 2+ adverse events will be summarized using CTCAE version 4.0 criteria., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until death or up to a maximum of 9 months|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause, where disease progression will be determined based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients that are alive and progression-free will be censored on their last tumor evaluation date.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until progression or death or up to a maximum of 6 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death from any cause. Subjects who did not die will be censored at their last visit., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until death or up to a maximum of 19 months|Time-to-Progression, Time-to-Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from registration to disease progression, where patients that are progression-free will be censored on their last tumor evaluation date., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until death or up to a maximum of 6 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the frequency (%) of patients who have a best response of PR, CR, or Stable disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; stable disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since the treatment started., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) to a maximum of 19 months|Explore the Association Between Response Rate (RR) and Other Endpoints (e.g., OS, PFS), The association between RR (using RECIST 1.1 (informed by irRECIST)) with other clinical endpoints (e.g., OS, PFS, etc.) was performed., From Cycle 1, Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days) until death or up to a maximum of 19 months
This is a proof-of-principle single-arm phase 2 study in patients with previously treated CUP. All patients receive pembrolizumab combined with Radiation Therapy (RT) to a metastatic site, so as to induce an abscopal tumor response. The treatment combination will be repeated with RT delivery to a second metastatic site in a non-overlapping RT field.

The results will be compared with historical control. The primary endpoint is the confirmed response rate (RR) in a non-irradiated site based on best responding abscopal lesion. This study will also evaluate the following secondary endpoints: RR in a non-irradiated site based on RECIST 1.1, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time-to-progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR).
