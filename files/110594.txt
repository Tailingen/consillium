A Phase I Clinical Study of SHR-A2009 for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, multicenter Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SHR-A2009 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: SHR-A2009
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD)., Incidence and category of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 21-day cycle of SHR-A2009 treatment., From Day 1 to Day 21|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D will be determined on the basis of evaluation on MTD/MAD, PK, efficacy data in dose escalation and dose expansion stages., From Day 1 to 90 days after last dose|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) ([CTCAE] v5.0), Assess safety and tolerability of SHR-A2009 by way of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0)., From Day 1 to 90 days after last dose
