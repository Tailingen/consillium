Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Nanoparticle Albumin-bound Paclitaxel in Lung Cancer
platinum-based albumin-bound paclitaxel regimen in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) especially in lung squamous cell carcinoma has a better tumor response rate and safety than solvent-based paclitaxel.However, the safety and efficacy is uncertain in neoadjuvant therapy.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel
Tumor response rate and Number of Adverse Events, From date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 2 months
disease free survival, From date of surgery until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 36 months
dynamic circulating tumor cell changes during treatment, baseline, 3 weeks and up to progression disease
The main purpose of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy of platinum-based albumin-bound paclitaxel regimen in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of stage â…¡ B and IIIA .
