Toripalimab Plus Pemetrexed+Platinus in Advanced Non-small-cell Lungcancer Patients Previsouly Treated EGFR-TKI
This is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Phase III Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) or placebo combined with chemotherapy in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Participants with TKI-resistant EGFR-mutated Tumors; and evaluate the population with the best predictive biomarkers, i.e., positive diagnosis population.

About 440 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with activated EGFR mutation will be 1:1 randomized into two groups, JS001 combined with the standard 1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the study group whereas placebo combined with standard 1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the control group. The stratification will be based on the following factors:

The history of the previous lines of EGFR-TKI treament ( 1st or 2nd generation of TKI vs. 3rd generation of TKI vs. 1st or 2nd generation of TKI + 3rd generation of TKI) ; Disease stage (IIIB-C vs. IV);
