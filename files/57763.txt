REFOCUS: A First-in-Human Study of Highly Selective FGFR2 Inhibitor, RLY-4008, in Patients With ICC and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, FIH study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PDy), and antineoplastic activity of RLY-4008, a potent and highly selective FGFR2 inhibitor, in patients with unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and other solid tumors. The study consists of 4 parts: a dose escalation (Part 1), a dose expansion (Part 2), and an extension (Part 3) and a rollover (Part 4).
