Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Inhibition Using Etanercept in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
The hypothesis is that a subset of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/ myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), including also patients with no clinical response after B-cell depletion therapy using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, may benefit from tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibition using Etanercept as weekly subcutaneous injections.
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome|Myalgic Encephalomyelitis
DRUG: Etanercept
Symptom alleviation within 12 months follow-up, as compared to baseline, measured by standardized self-reports and quality of life schemes., The primary endpoint is defined as moderate or major response of the CFS/ME symptoms, of at least six weeks duration, independent on when during 12 months follow-up the response period(s) occurs. Single such response periods, and the sum of these, are recorded., Response of at least six weeks duration, independent on when occuring, during 12 months follow-up.
Symptom alleviation, as compared to baseline, measured by standardized self-reports and quality of life schemes., The secondary outcome measures are effect on the CFS/ME symptoms, by evaluation at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after start of intervention., At 3, 6, 9, 12 months after start of intervention.
