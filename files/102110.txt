Study of PD-1 Inhibitor JTX-4014 Alone and in Combination With Vopratelimab in Biomarker-selected Subjects With Metastatic NSCLC After One Prior Platinum-containing Regimen
This is a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate PD-1 inhibitor pimivalimab (JTX-4014) alone and in combination with vopratelimab (JTX-2011), an ICOS agonist, in biomarker-selected adult subjects with metastatic NSCLC who are PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor naïve and have progressed on a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

Pimivalimab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to programmed cell death receptor protein-1 (PD-1) and block its interaction with its ligands, programmed cell death receptor protein-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death receptor protein-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), to augment anti-tumor T cell activity. Vopratelimab is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Inducible CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 2, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability of pimivalimab alone and in combination with vopratelimab in biomarker-selected adult subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor naïve and have progressed on a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.
