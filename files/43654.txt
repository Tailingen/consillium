Chidamide Prevents Recurrence of High-risk AML After Allo-HSCT
The goal of this phase I/II clinical trial is to test in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients undergoing allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The main question it aims to answer is:

• The efficacy and safety of chidamide maintenance therapy in reducing the recurrence rate and GVHD incidence in high-risk AML patients after allo-HSCT.

Participants will take oral chidamide (Epidaza) until 180 days after allo-HSCT.
