Quality of Life in Patients After Combined Modality Treatment of Rectal Cancer
The goal of this study is gathering informations about patients' quality of life after combined modality treatment of rectal cancer to evaluate how combined modality treatment for rectal cancer affects patients' quality of life. The findings of this study may provide us important information that can be used in treatment decision and to develop programs to improve quality of life of patients with rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: questionnaires
To prospectively evaluate the quality of life of patients one year after rectal cancer resection, one year after the operation
To prospectively evaluate the quality of life of patients at baseline, consecutive patients treated winh capecitabine-based radiochemotherapy, before treatment (at baseline)|To prospectively evaluate the quality of life of patients two years after rectal cancer resection, two years after the operation
Over the last two decades, rectal cancer research has lead to better understanding of disease behaviour, resulting in more efficient treatments and higher prevalence of cancer survivors.Due to aggressive therapy, rectal cancer survivors can exhibit late sequelae of treatment, most common being impaired bowel, voiding, sexual malfunctioning and quality of life impairment. In order to determine the impact of rectal cancer and its treatment on patients' quality of life over time, this study will prospectively follow a cohort of patients at specified intervals evaluating their physical symptoms, physical and social functioning and overall quality of life.Medical and sociodemographic factors that might be predictive will be tested.
