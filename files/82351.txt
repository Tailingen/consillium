A Phase IIb Study of BPI-7711 Capsule in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With T790M Mutation Positive
A phase IIb, open-label, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of BPI-7711 capsule in patients with metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation and T790M mutation positive.
NSCLC
DRUG: BPI-7711
ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review (ICR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (according to independent review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., up to 52 weeks
ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by investigators, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (according to independent review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., up to 52 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST 1.1, DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or SD (according to independent review), prior to progression (PD) or further anti-cancer therapy., up to 104 weeks|Progression free survival(PFS) according to RECIST 1.1, PFS is the time from date of first dose until the date of PD (by independent review) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from BPI-7711 therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment., up to 104 weeks
This is a phase IIb, open-label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of BPI-7711 (180 mg, orally, once daily) in China with a confirmed diagnosis of EGFR sensitizing mutation positive and T790M mutation+ unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have progressed on prior EGFR-TKIs treatment. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of BPI-7711 by assessment of ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
