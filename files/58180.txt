LCI-GU-BLA-SPEC-001: Aurora Kinase Expression in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a prospective, single arm, observational study examining aurora kinases and circulating tumor cells in subjects with bladder cancer being treated with standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Bladder Cancer
Correlation of pathologic response rate and aurora kinase expression, Within 6 months of subject enrollment
Subjects will receive neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy per standard of care. CTC and Aurora kinase expression patterns will be analyzed in subject specimens for correlation with clinicopathologic outcome. Subjects will be on study for a total of five years following cystectomy.
