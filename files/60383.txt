Clinical Study of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Lymphocytes (CAR-T) in the Treatment of Myeloid Leukemia
Researchers plan to enroll a total of 100 patients with relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to receive a single dose of autologous CAR T cells.The safety of CAR T therapy was evaluated by observing adverse events after cell therapy;The efficacy of CAR-T therapy was evaluated against the outcome of patients' own past standard treatment regimens or historical data.Blood and bone marrow were collected before and 12 months after infusion to detect the number and activity of CAR T cells, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAR T cells.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Anti-CLL1 CART cells
Incidence of AE after CAR-T infusion, Incidence of adverse events after CAR-T infusion

Data. The records of adverse events (AE) should include: description of AE and all related symptoms, occurrence time, severity, duration, measures taken, final results and outcomes. According to NCI CTC AE 5.0 standard, AE was scored

Grade.

Safety evaluation indexes include but are not limited to the following contents

1. Any spontaneously reported and all directly observed adverse events;
2. Any abnormal changes in vital signs and physical examination;
3. The abnormal results of laboratory examination, physical examination and blood examination with clinical significance after treatment, up to 12 months after CAR-T infusion
