Radiotherapy Combined With Endostatin and Capecitabine for NPC
Radiotherapy combined with recombinant human endostatin and capecitabine for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) resistant to induction chemotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Endostatin and Capecitabine
Recurrence free survival (RFS), calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of locoregional failure, distant failure, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, 3 years
overall survival (OS), calculated from date of randomisation to death, 5 years|distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), calculated from date of randomisation to the first distant failure, 3 years|Local-regional free survival (LRFS), calculated from date of randomisation to the first Local-regional failure, 3 years|adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAE), graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, 5 years|quality of life (QoL), the change of QoL from randomization to 12 months after chemoradiation, graded according to EORTC QLQ-C30 V3.0, 3 years
This study was a single-arm, open-label, phase II study of radiotherapy combined with recombinant human endostatin and capecitabine for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) resistant to induction chemotherapy. fourty-one patients of locally advanced NPC resistant to induction chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients received radiotherapy combined with recombinant human endostatin and capecitabine. The primary endpoint was Recurrence free survival (RFS). Secondary goals included overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), Local-regional free survival (LRFS); adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAE); safety and quality of life (QoL).
