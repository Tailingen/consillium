Study of Predictive Immunological Parameters of Molecular Complete Remission in Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Chronic Phase and Treated With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
The investigators recently identified promiscuous HLA-DR-derived epitopes from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) called universal cancer peptides (UCP), to study tumor-specific CD4+ T cell responses.

The aim of this prospective preliminary study is to evaluate the presence of UCP-specific Th1 responses in patients in complete remission of CML two years after end of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKi) treatments.
