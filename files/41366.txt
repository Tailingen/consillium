Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging of the Prostate
Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) represents a potential leap forward in improving prostate cancer early detection: a non-invasive and accurate imaging test for clinically significant prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: MRI with DBSI analysis
Area under the curve (AUC) comparison from biopsy and DBSI, * As a per patient analysis, the investigators will use the highest Gleason score from the biopsy as the reference standard
* In the per patient analysis, Gleason 7 or greater, will be the cut-off as this will be considered "clinically significant". The investigators will also perform similar analyses with cut-offs of Gleason 4+3=7 or greater, as well as Gleason 6 or greater. This will serve as the sensitivity analysis., Up to 12 weeks|Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) comparison from biopsy to DBSI, * As a per patient analysis, the investigators will use the highest Gleason score from the biopsy as the reference standard

The investigators will also perform similar analyses with cut-offs of Gleason 4+3=7 or greater, as well as Gleason 6 or greater. This will serve as the sensitivity analysis., Up to 12 weeks|Prostate sector analysis as measured by comparison of the highest Gleason score from each of the 10 biopsy sectors to the DBSI predicted pathology from each sector, Up to 12 weeks
Comparison of Gleason score from the MRI regions of interest to the DBSI predicted pathology, -Only for those patients with a suspicious MRI lesion, Up to 12 weeks|Area under the curve (AUC) comparison from DBSI to conventional MRI interpretation, Up to 12 weeks|Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) comparison from DBSI to conventional MRI interpretation, Up to 12 weeks
