Phase I/II FIH Study of 9MW2921 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, Phase I-II, first-in-human (FIH) study of 9MW2921 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory to all standard therapies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of 9MW2921.
