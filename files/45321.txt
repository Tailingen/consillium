A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine (Elranatamab) in Participants With Multiple Myeloma That Has Come Back After Responding to Treatment or Has Not Responded to Treatment
The purpose of the study (Part 1 and Part 2) is to evaluate the safety of a step-up dosing approach (starting with low doses followed by higher doses) of the study medicine (elranatamab) in participants with multiple myeloma that has come back after responding to treatment or has not responded to treatment (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma). This study will also look at the safety and efficacy of different doses of elranatamab, as well as different intervals between doses.

Participants in the study will receive elranatamab as an injection under the skin at the study clinic. After the initial step-up doses, participants will start receiving one dose every week. The frequency of clinic visits for injections may then decrease over time. Participation will be at least two years.

The purpose of the study (Part 1 and Part 2) of the study is to evaluate the safety (in particular the rate of Grade ≥ 2 CRS) of a step-up priming dose regimen of elranatamab in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, this study will assess the safety of different dosing regimens of elranatamab and if it can provide a clinical benefit in those participants. Elranatamab is a bispecific antibody: binding of elranatamab to CD3-expressing T-cells and BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cells causes targeted T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
