International Cancer of the Head and Neck, Genetics and Environment (InterCHANGE) Study
Our overall objective is to understand the role of lifestyle factors, genetics and HPV infection in the development and prognosis of head and neck cancer particularly in Asia.
Evaluate the Association Between Certain Environmental Exposures (e.g. Cigarette Smoking, Alcohol Drinking, Betel Nut Chewingâ€¦) and Head and Neck Cancers|Assess the Effect of Genetic Factors, Including Both SNP and Copy Number Variation (CNV) Through Analysis of Both Main Effect and Gene-gene Interaction
