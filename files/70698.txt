This open label, multi center, first-in-human study consists of 2parts.

-Part 1: The dose is increased according to the prescribed dose escalation schedule.

Dose escalation proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is reached. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is evaluated after completing cycle 1 administration for all subjects enrolled for each dose group in order to determine whether to proceed to the next level. all matters related to dose escalation are subject to the decision of the SRC. If DLT occurs in two subjects during the first dose level process, the dose level reset by the SRC is reflected and study protocol amendment procedure is followed accordingly. Following completion of the DLT evaluation of the planned dose level in this study, the SRC reviews the outcome of the evaluation and determines whether to set additional dosing or proceed to PART 2 (Dose expansion).

-Part 2: In Part 2, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the CKD-702 Inj. determined in Part 1 is set as the treatment dose, and the dose must be administered with the same administration methods as Part 1, repeating cycles.
