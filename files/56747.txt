TDLN-sparing RT Plus Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced ESCC
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if immunotherapy in combination with tumor draining lymph nodes-sparing radiotherapy (TDLN-sparing RT) and chemotherapy works to treat locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer in adults.

Researchers will compare immunotherapy in combination with TDLN-sparing RT and chemotherapy to TDLN-sparing RT and chemotherapy to see if immunotherapy works more effectively when using TDLN-sparing RT to treat locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer

Participants will:

TDLN-sparing RT for esophageal cancer 50.4Gy/28Fx Paclitaxel plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for 4 cycles PD-1 inhibitors or observation every 3 weeks for 1 year
