High Dose CHOP in Lymphoma
The study hypothesis is that intensification of CHOP by dose escalation of the most active drugs in the combination will improve treatment outcome. Patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma are treated by high cyclophosphamide containing CHOP. The planned dose is 3000 mg/m2 which is 4 times the atandard one. Only 4 cycles are given.
