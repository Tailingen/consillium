Phase I/Ib Trial of LSZ102 Single Agent or LSZ102 + LEE011 or LSZ102 + BYL719 in ER+ Breast Cancers
To characterize the safety and tolerability, identify recommended doses and regimens for future studies, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LSZ102 as a single agent and in combination with either LEE011 or BYL719 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer who have progressed after endocrine therapy.
Advanced or Metastatic ER+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: LSZ102|DRUG: LEE011|DRUG: BYL719
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by well-established statistical methods/models to estimate the maximum tolerated doses (MTD)and/or recommended doses for expansion (RDE). Safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data will guide dose escalation decisions., Day 1 - Day 28 of Cycle 1 (28 day cycle)|Safety and tolerability of LSZ102, LSZ102 + LEE011 and LSZ102 + BYL719, Incidence and severity of adverse events, serious adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, dose interruptions, dose reductions and dose intensity., Approximately 3 years
Overall response rate (ORR), Assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity of LSZ102, LSZ102 + LEE011 and LSZ102 + BYL719. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response., Approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity of LSZ102, LSZ102 + LEE011 and LSZ102 + BYL719, 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity of LSZ102, LSZ102 + LEE011 and LSZ102 + BYL719, 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Assessment of preliminary anti-tumor activity of LSZ102, LSZ102 + LEE011 and LSZ102 + BYL719, 3 years|Plasma concentration of study medications, Plasma concentration versus time, 1 cycle (28 day cycle)|Plasma concentration under fasted condition and fed condition, Plasma concentration versus time under fasted and fed conditions, Up to 2 cycles (28 day cycle)|Levels of Pharmacodynamic marker Estrogen receptor (ER), To assess pharmacodynamics effect, 3 years|Levels of Pharmacodynamic marker Progesterone receptor (PgR), To assess the pharmacodynamic effect, 3 years|Levels of Pharmacodynamic marker pS6, To assess the pharmacodynamic effect, 3 years|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter AUC, AUC = Area under curve, 6 cycles (28 day cycle)|PK parameter Cmax, Cmax = Maximum observed plasma concentration after drug administration, 6 cycles (28 day cycle)|PK parameter Tmax, Tmax = Time to reach Cmax, 6 cycles (28 day cycle)|PK parameter Cmin, Cmin = Minimum observed plasma concentration after drug administration, 6 cycles (28 day cycle)
To characterize the safety and tolerability, identify recommended doses and regimens for future studies, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LSZ102 as a single agent and in combination with either LEE011 or BYL719 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer who have progressed after endocrine therapy.
