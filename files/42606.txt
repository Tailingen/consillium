Paclitaxel and ABI-007 in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and ABI-007, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with ABI-007 in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine whether a change in the formulation alters the pharmacokinetic profile of paclitaxel in the plasma of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with ABI-007 and paclitaxel.

Secondary

* Correlate pharmacokinetic data of this regimen with decrease in the neutrophil count at nadir in these patients.
* Determine the intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of ABI-007 in these patients.
* Determine protein binding of paclitaxel via measurement of Î±-1-acid glycoprotein and serum albumin levels in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study.

* Courses 1 and 2: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

  * Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 22.
  * Arm II: Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 22.
* Courses 3 and beyond: All patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
