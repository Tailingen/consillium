Desensitizing Distressing Recollections in Cancer Patients
The major goal of this study is to determine whether Neuro-Emotional Technique is a viable treatment option for decreasing distress in cancer patients. The potential advantages of NET are: 1) it is designed specifically to address distressing stimuli and unresolved emotional memories; 2) it is a brief, time-limited intervention; and 3) its multi-modal design may appeal to and benefit a broader range of patients than a single mode intervention
