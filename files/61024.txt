Primary Tumor Burden Score:A Novel Staging Parameter for ESCC After nCRT
In this case-only study, the investigators try to define a novel staging parameter, the Primary Tumor Burden Score (PTBS).
Neoplasm, Esophagus|Neoplasm, Squamous Cell
PROCEDURE: nCRT
Five-year survival of patients, The survival of the patients was recorded by follow-up for five years after surgery., From surgery to the end of follow-up(at least 5 years later)
In this case-only study, the investigators try to define a novel staging parameter, the Primary Tumor Burden Score (PTBS), which will combine the proportion of residual primary tumor cells and pre-treatment pathological T stage (prepT stage). The investigators will also try to improve ypTNM stage by results of PTBS.
