A Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in People With Unfavorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment approach for people with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate. The researchers will see whether SBRT can prevent participants' cancer from coming back and/or spreading to other parts of the body. In addition, they will look closely at how safe and effective it is to rely on Decipher test results for determining which patients would benefit from more extensive radiation treatments
