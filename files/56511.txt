Clinical Studies of New Model Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Building a new haploid transplanted model with high-dose CTX、CD19-CART,donor CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell and Tregs,to prevent graft-versus-host disease(GVHD),reduce the infection,promote the rate of immune reconstruction，seperate graft versus leukemia（GVL）and GVHD，then to reduce the relapse rate after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation（HSCT）for relapsed and/or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia（r/r-B-ALL）.
CD19-chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells|Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|the Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
PROCEDURE: the new model of haplo-HSCT for r/r B-ALL
disease free survival at six months, the disease free survival of the new model haplo-HSCT will be assessed at 6 months., six months|acute graft-versus-host disease, we will examine the treatment-related acute GVHD at 3 months., three months
compare the new haplo-HSCT model with the traditional haplo-HSCT in DFS、OS、RFS、CR and the degree of GVHD.etc.for the r/r B-ALL patients.
