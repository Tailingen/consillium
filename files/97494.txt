PLX3397 Plus Sirolimus in Unresectable Sarcoma and Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with PLX3397 and Sirolimus will be tolerated and result in shrinking of the cancer or stopping the cancer from growing. In the phase I portion, the maximum tolerate dose of the study drug will be determined. In the Phase II portion, progression free survival will be assessed at the dose level found in Phase I. Participants will continue to take the study drug until they experience an unacceptable side effect or their disease progresses. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent up to 10% of adult soft tissue sarcomas. Due to its rarity, few MPNST-specific prospective trials exist, and treatments are largely based on extrapolation from results from other sarcoma subtypes. Since the molecular pathways driving pathogenesis within sarcoma subtypes are distinct, these treatment options are likely suboptimal at best. Targeted therapies that block key pathways known to drive MPNST will likely result in superior tumor responses with limited toxicities.
