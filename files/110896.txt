Two-Dose Level Evaluation of NX-1207 for the Treatment of Low Risk, Localized (T1c) Prostate Cancer
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single injection of NX-1207 for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed low risk localized (T1c) prostate cancer in patients currently undergoing active surveillance. Study participants currently on active surveillance will be randomized either to treatment with a single intraprostatic injection of NX-1207 (2.5 mg or 15 mg) followed by active surveillance or to no treatment (continued active surveillance). Blinded efficacy evaluation will be by a second post-treatment prostate biopsy.
