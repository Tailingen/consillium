A Phase I Study of MLN6907 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal
This study is a first-in-human (FIH), single-dose, open-label, phase 1 study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), distribution, and radiation dosimetry of \[68Ga\]MLN6907 after a single intravenous (IV) administration. Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma who are scheduled for resection of liver metastases as part of their treatment plan will be eligible for enrollment.
