Since 1982,cancer has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan. In particular,gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in male cancer patients and the sixth for female patients in 2000,accounting for an estimated 2,374 deaths. In recent years, the treatment of gastric cancer patients has gradually been improving due to advances in early diagnosis and surgical techniques. Although chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been used in either the adjuvant or palliative setting, their values are still limited due to their unacceptable toxicity or inadequate efficiency.
