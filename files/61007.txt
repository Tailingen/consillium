Curcumin Biomarker Trial in Head and Neck Cancer
There is considerable evidence that turmeric consumption may have a protective effect against cancer progression. The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of supplementation with a turmeric extract, Curcumin C3 Complex速, on biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Microgranular Curcumin C3 Complex速
Change in tissue biomarkers, Change in tissue levels, between pre- and post-treatment biopsy, 21-28 days|Pharmacokinetics of microgranular curcumin, Determine whether biologically active levels of curcumin can be achieved in head and neck tumors, 21-28 days
Ease of ingestion, Determine if microgranular curcumin can be easily ingested, 21-28 days
This is an open label, exploratory biomarker trial of the food substances Curcumin C3 Complex速 in subjects with newly diagnosed HNSCC. Curcumin, a novel safe nutritional interventional agent has exciting potential usage as a preventive/adjuvant agent, and prevents tumor formation by inhibiting an important molecular pathway that is shown to cause cancer progression, which we will test as a tumor marker in this clinical trial.

The primary objective is to evaluate biomarker response of HNSCC patients to the food substances Curcumin C3 Complex速. This will be done by comparing post-intervention values to baseline values. In addition, we will determine the levels of curcumin and its metabolites in tumor and adjacent tissue.
