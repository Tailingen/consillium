EORTC QLQ-C30 is scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for a functional/global health status scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning/HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life);however a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A ≥10-point change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by patients as clinically significant (Osoba et al.1998)., Baseline up to approximately 29 months|TTD in Patient-Reported Lung Cancer Symptoms as Determined by EORTC Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13) Score, QLQ-LC13 Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module incorporates one multiple-item scale to assess dyspnea and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for a functional/global health status scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning/HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life); however, a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A ≥10-point change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by patients as clinically significant (Osoba et al. 1998)., Baseline up to approximately 29 months|Change From Baseline in Patient-Reported Lung Cancer Symptoms Score Using the Symptoms in Lung Cancer (SILC) Scale, The SILC (Symptoms in Lung Cancer) scale was used to assess patient-reported severity of lung cancer symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, and cough). The SILC scale is a 9-item content validated self-report measure of lung cancer symptoms. It measures severity of cough, dyspnea, and chest pain with a symptom severity score. The SILC questionnaire comprises three individual symptoms (dyspnea, cough, chest pain) and are scored at the individual symptom level, thus have a dyspnea score, chest pain score, and cough score. Each individual symptom score is calculated as the average of responses for the symptom items \[e.g. Chest Pain Score=mean (item 1; item 2)\]. An increase in score is suggestive of a worsening in symptomology (i.e. frequency or severity). A score change of ≥0.3 points for the dyspnea and cough symptom scores is considered to be clinically significant; whereas a score change of ≥0.5 points for the chest pain score is considered to be clinically significant., Baseline up to approximately 29 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of participants with at least one adverse event., Baseline up to data cutoff date 7 December 2020 (up to approximately 68 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies (ATAs) to Atezolizumab, Baseline up to approximately 29 months|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Atezolizumab in Arm A and Arm B, The predose samples will be collected on the same day of treatment administration.
