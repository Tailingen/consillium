Postoperative Analgesia in Major Gynecological Cancer Surgeries
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of epidural block or erector spinae plane block applied for postoperative analgesia in gynecological cancer surgeries.

The main question(s) it aims to answer are:

\[Is erector spinae plane block as effective as epidural block in postoperative analgesia?\] The study was designed as a prospective randomized study. Researchers evaluated the effects of epidural block or erector spinae plane block applied for postoperative analgesia on pain scores, postoperative opioid use, and mobilization in patients undergoing gynecological cancer surgery.

postoperative numerical rating scale, The primary purpose of this study is to compare NRS values at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Numeric rating scale was used to assess postoperative pain For example, 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable., postoperatvely 24 hours
Intraoperative amount of remifentanyl, The secondary aim of this study is to compare the amount of intraoperative remifentanyl, intraoperative process
postoperative mobilization time, The other purpose of this study is the first postoperative mobilization process, postoperatvely 24 hours
Our study was designed as a prospective randomized study. The investigators evaluated the analgesia methods used in patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer between May 2024 and December 2024. The investigators evaluated the effect of epidural block or erector spina plan block on postoperative analgesia, opioid use and mobilization.
