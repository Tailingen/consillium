Combination Chemotherapy Plus Filgrastim in Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus filgrastim in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: estramustine phosphate sodium
Response rate, Up to 2 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate (objective and PSA response) and duration of response to estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin with filgrastim (G-CSF) support in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.
