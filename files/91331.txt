Phase II Study of the Use of Neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel With Hormonal Treatment in Patients Operable Prostate Cancer, Assess the Efficacy and Toxicity of Cabazitaxel, and Explore Potential Predictive and Prognostic Markers of Clinical Outcome
This study is evaluating the efficacy of cabazitaxel and hormonal treatment as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with clinically operable disease suitable for surgery, and a high risk of relapse after surgery
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel
To assess the efficacy activity of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in patients with high risk operable prostate cancer, measuring the reduction in treatment failure and comparing this to that obtained in the control arm, Treatment failure is defined as: PSA level ≥ 0.12ng/ml measured on at least two occasions (1 confirmatory sample) post-surgery within three years of follow-up or death related to prostate cancer or use of a salvage therapy or not undergoing surgery at all.), through study completion, average 3 years
• To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, measuring the pathological and radiological response rates and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., Pathological response rate assessed as per pTNM staging system Radiological response rates as defined in RECIST V1.1 Combined to give overall response rate, 3 year follow up|To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, assessing surgical margin involvement and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., The proportion of patients with positive resection margin will be reported and compared across the treatment groups using Chi-square tests. Multivariable models using logistic regression techniques shall be used to adjust for key prognostic variables of interest., 3 year follow up|To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, assessing lymph node involvement and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., The proportion of patients with positive lymph nodes will be reported and compared across the treatment groups using Chi-square tests., 3 year follow up|To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, measuring progression free survival and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., 3 year follow up|• To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, measuring overall survival from time of randomisation to death and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., 3 year follow up|To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, measuring surgical feasibility and comparing this to that obtained in a control arm of immediate surgery., The proportion of patients with delays to surgery, perioperative morbidities, mortalities and surgical complications will be reported and compared across the treatment groups., 3 year follow up|To assess the quality of life of patients receiving neoadjuvant Cabazitaxel chemotherapy and hormonal therapy and comparing this to quality of life patients in a control arm of immediate surgery using the EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire., Responses to EORTC QLQ-C30 will be reported (median, IQR) according to global health status, the functional scales and symptom scales, by intervention group, and over time. Joint modelling or quality-adjusted survival analysis will be undertaken to allow a simultaneous assessment of quality of life and survival., 3 year follow up
This study is evaluating the efficacy of cabazitaxel and hormonal treatment (LHRH analogues) as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with clinically operable disease suitable for surgery (no lymph node, visceral or bony metastases), and a high risk of relapse after surgery (5 year risk of relapse).

Patients will receive four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment (cabazitaxel treatment and 3 months LHRH treatment) unless there is evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient request to withdraw consent.
