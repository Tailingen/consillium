Modafinil in Treating Children With Memory and Attention Problems Caused by Cancer Treatment for a Brain Tumor
RATIONALE: Modafinil may help improve memory, attention, and fatigue caused by cancer treatment.

PURPOSE: This phase II randomized trial studies how well modafinil works in treating children with memory and attention problems caused by cancer treatment for a brain tumor.

Change in Age-Adjusted Scores at Week Six From Baseline in the Attention Task of the CogState Battery, CogState Battery. CogState is a semi-automated, computerized cognitive testing system that was developed as a rapid and accurate test of cognitive function specifically for repeated assessment that is sensitive to the effects of medication in children over the age of 5 years and in adults from different language, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. The CogState tasks to assess processing speed, visual attention, working memory and executive function were used. The CogState battery was administered in the following order: Detection Task, Identification Task, One Card Learning Task, One Back Task, and lastly, the Modified Groton Maze Learning Task. It was administered at baseline and 6 weeks. A positive change from baseline is an improvement. There is not a minimum or maximum since the value is reported as a z-score, but with the mean = 0 and the SD = 1, the range should be between -3 and 3., Baseline and 6 weeks
Number of Reported Adverse Events (AEs), AEs gathered using SAFTEE (Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects) and participant report on daily log., 30 days post intervention|Change in Working Memory Score at 6 Weeks From Baseline as Assessed on BRIEF, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). The BRIEF is a behavior rating scale designed to assess executive functions in the home and school environments. The measure was selected to provide parent-reported outcomes of problems related to attention, memory and executive function that occur in everyday life. The instrument was utilized to measure the change in working memory, according to the parent's perspective only, from baseline to 6 weeks. Scores are linear transformations of raw scores into T scores (mean = 50, SD = 10); higher scores indicate greater difficulties. The baseline score was subtracted from the 6 week score. Positive change from baseline is an improvement. The total scale ranges from 0 to 172. A T score \>60 on the BRIEF working memory subscale indicates cognitive impairment., Baseline and 6 weeks|Change in PedsQL Score at 6 Weeks From Baseline, PedsQL is Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Multi-dimensional Fatigue Scale. This scale is designed as a generic symptom-specific instrument to measure fatigue. Higher scores indicate fewer symptoms of fatigue. It was administered at baseline and 6 weeks. The score is the sum of the answers. The baseline score was subtracted from the 6 week score. A positive change indicates worsening. The scale total score range is from 0-72 for both the parent and patient reported instruments., Baseline and 6 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine whether a 6-week drug trial of modafinil, compared to placebo, is associated with improvement in neurocognitive function as defined by direct assessment of attention in children with cognitive impairment after treatment for a primary brain tumor.

Secondary

* Determine whether modafinil, compared to placebo, is associated with improved executive function, as assessed using the BRIEF executive function and hippocampal learning and executive function tasks from the CogState battery. Determine whether modafinil, compared to placebo, is associated with improved attention, as assessed by the Conners' (3rd Edition) 3 Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-3) - Short Form.
* Determine whether modafinil, compared to placebo, is associated with reduced fatigue as assessed using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale.
* Evaluate the safety of modafinil in this population.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Participants receive modafinil orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42.
* Arm II: Participants receive placebo PO QD on days 1-42. Participants complete a semi-automated, computerized cognitive-testing system (CogState) designed to assess psychomotor, attention/vigilance, memory, and other components of executive function by presenting different tasks, each with its own set of rules, at baseline and after completion of study therapy. Participants also complete the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (Peds QL-MFS).

Parents or legal guardians complete the PedsQL-MFS, the Conners Parent Reported Scale (CPR-3), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) at baseline and after completion of study therapy.

Clinical and/or research staff administer the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergency Events (SAFTEE), a semi-structured interview designed to elicit adverse events, at baseline and periodically during study.

After completion of study therapy, participants are followed up for 30 days.
