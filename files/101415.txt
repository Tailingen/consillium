PaTcH Study: A Phase 2 Study of Trametinib and Hydroxychloroquine in Patients With Metastatic Refractory Pancreatic Cancer
This study is designed to investigate the means by which cancer resists treatment can be overcome by a combination of an established anticancer drug, trametinib, with hydroxychloroquine.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine

The number of successfully established organoid cultures per patient before and on treatment, The number of successfully established organoid cultures per patient from biopsies of patients with pancreatic cancer being treated with trametinib and hydroxychloroquine before treatment and on treatment., Through study treatment, an average of one year|Organoid resistance to trametinib and hydroxychloroquine, The number of organoids resistant to trametinib and hydroxychloroquine treatment as measured by proliferation and apoptosis rates., Through study treatment, an average of one year|Resistance mechanisms and their potential therapies in vitro, A list of potential resistance mechanisms and their potential therapies that can be tested on in vitro organoid cultures., Through study treatment, an average of one year|Comparison of new methods of multi-omics data integration vs existing models using AUROC, A comparison the performance of new methods of multi-omics data integration against existing models using AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) analysis., Through study treatment, an average of one year
The study is a multi-centre single arm Phase 2 clinical trial to explore primary and emerging resistance mechanisms in patients with metastatic refractory pancreatic cancer treated with trametinib and hydroxychloroquine. This study will include 10-22 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have previously progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy.
