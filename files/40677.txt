BGB-43395 Alone or as Part of Combination Therapies in Chinese Participants With HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1a/1b clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-43395, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor, as monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant, letrozole, or other combination partners in Chinese participants with hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC) and other advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

MAD is defined as the highest dose administered if MTD is not reached., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1a: Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDFE) of BGB-43395, RDFE of BGB-43395 alone or as part of combination therapies will be determined based upon the MTD or MAD., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1b: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to approximately 30 months
Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have confirmed CR or PR assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1b: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug(s) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs including findings from physical examinations, ECGs, and laboratory assessments as needed., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drugs to the date of the first determination of objective response that is confirmed by a subsequent response as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1b: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting â‰¥ 24 weeks., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 1a: Observed plasma maximum concentration (Cmax) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Observed plasma trough concentration (Ctrough) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Half-life (t1/2) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1b: Plasma concentrations of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
