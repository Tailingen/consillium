Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection of Gastric Subepithelial Tumors (FROST)
Prospective observational trial. A full thickness resection of gastric subepithelial tumors is performed after application of full thickness sutures underneath the tumor with the GERDX(TM) device. Hypothesis: This endoscopic method is feasible, effective and safe.
Gastric Neoplasms|Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DEVICE: GERDX(TM)
Rate of cases in which a complete macroscopic en bloc resection of the gastric subepithelial tumor could be achieved, intraoperative
Rate of cases in which a complete microscopic resection of the gastric subepithelial tumor could be achieved, within one week after resection (as soon as result of pathologic analysis of resected specimen is available)|Rate of complications (bleeding, perforation), 6 months after resection|Duration of hospitalization, within one week after resection|Number of participants with local or systemic recidive of tumor, 6 months after resection|Number of participants with needs of surgical therapy or endoscopic re-resection, 6 months after resection
