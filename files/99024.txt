A Study to Test the Safety/ Efficacy of Brivaracetam (BRV) Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Subjects >=16 Years of Age With Partial Seizures With or Without Secondary Generalization
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Brivaracetam (BRV) in focal epilepsy subjects with partial seizures and to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of BRV over time.
Partial Seizures With or Without Secondary Generalization|Epilepsy
DRUG: Brivaracetam
Percentage of study participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From study entry until Final Visit (up to 70 months)
Percent change in partial seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline of EP0083 or N01358 to the Evaluation Period, The seizure frequency is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days. This evaluation will be done every 3 months of the Evaluation Period (by 3-month periods). Change in seizure frequency from Baseline of EP0083 (NCT03083665) or N01358 (NCT01261325) is calculated as the seizure frequency at the evaluation time point minus the seizure frequency at Baseline of EP0083 or N01358., Baseline of EP0083 or N01358 and by 3-month periods over the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Responder rate in partial seizure frequency per 28 days over the Evaluation Period, The seizure frequency is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days. This evaluation will be done every 3 months of the Evaluation Period (by 3-month periods). A responder is defined as a subject with a \>= 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline Period of EP0083 or N01358., Baseline of EP0083 or N01358 and by 3-month periods over the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types (partial, generalized, and unclassified epileptic seizure) for at least 6 months during the Evaluation Period, A study participant was considered seizure free, if no seizure occurred during 6 consecutive months in the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types (partial, generalized, and unclassified epileptic seizure) for at least 12 months during the Evaluation Period, A study participant was considered seizure free, if no seizure occurred during 12 consecutive months in the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types during the Evaluation Period, A study participant was considered seizure free (partial, all epileptic seizure), if no seizure occurred during the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percent change in partial seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline of directly enrolled study participants to the Evaluation Period, The seizure frequency for directly enrolled participants is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days from 8 weeks prior to BRV administration.

Change in seizure frequency is calculated as the seizure frequency at the evaluation time point minus the seizure frequency at Baseline of directly enrolled participants., Baseline from 8 weeks prior to BRV administration over the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Responder rate in partial seizure frequency per 28 days over the Evaluation Period for directly enrolled study participants, The seizure frequency for directly enrolled participants is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days from 8 weeks prior to BRV administration.

A responder is defined as a study participant with a \>= 50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline Period., Baseline from 8 weeks prior to BRV administration over the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types (partial, generalized, and unclassified epileptic seizure) for at least 6 months during the Evaluation Period for directly enrolled study particpants, A study participant was considered seizure free, if no seizure occurred during 6 consecutive months in the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types (partial, generalized, and unclassified epileptic seizure) for at least 12 months during the Evaluation Period for directly enrolled study particpants, A study participant was considered seizure free, if no seizure occurred during 12 consecutive months in the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)|Percentage of participants continuously seizure-free for partial seizure and all seizure types during the Evaluation Period for directly enrolled study particpants, A study participant was considered seizure free (partial, all epileptic seizure), if no seizure occurred during the Evaluation Period., During the Evaluation Period (up to 70 months)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Brivaracetam (BRV) in focal epilepsy subjects with partial seizures and to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy of BRV over time.
