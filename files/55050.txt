Elevated Platelet Count as Prognostic Factor in Colorectal Cancer With Synchronous Liver Metastases
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide and is often metastatic at diagnosis. Despite progresses in surgical techniques and the introduction of novel chemotherapy regimens, many patients still suffer from a poor prognosis. It is therefore of utmost importance to identify prognostic markers that may improve selection of patients.

In recent years several studies demonstrated that preoperative blood tests as platelet count or neuthophil-to-lymphocyte ratio could be prognostic factors in CRC as well as other malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of preoperative platelet count (PC) in patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases.
