Efficacy and Safety of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir Fixed Dose Combination in the Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection in Pediatric Participants Undergoing Cancer Chemotherapy
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in pediatric participants who are undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
Hepatitis C Virus Infection
DRUG: LDV/SOF
Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 12 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR12), SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA \< the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, 50 IU/mL) at 12 weeks after stopping study treatment., Posttreatment Week 12|Percentage of Participants Who Permanently Discontinued Study Drug Due to an Adverse Event, First dose date up to Week 12
Percentage of Participants With HCV RNA < LLOQ at 4 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR4), SVR4 was defined as HCV RNA \< LLOQ at 4 weeks after stopping study treatment., Posttreatment Week 4|Percentage of Participants With HCV RNA < LLOQ at 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR24), SVR24 was defined as HCV RNA \< LLOQ at 24 weeks after stopping study treatment., Posttreatment Week 24|Percentage of Participants With HCV RNA < LLOQ While on Treatment, Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12|HCV RNA Change From Baseline/Day 1, Baseline; Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12|Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure, Virologic failure was defined as:

* On-treatment virologic failure:

  * Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA \< LLOQ while on treatment), or
  * Rebound (confirmed \> 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
  * Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
* Virologic relapse:

  * Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA \< LLOQ at last on-treatment visit, Baseline to Posttreatment Week 24
