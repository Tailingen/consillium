Performance of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T for RLT in mCRPC - Prospective Multicenter Swiss Registry Study
The goal of this observational study (multicenter, national registry-based) is to evaluate the performance of 177Lu-ITG-PSMA-1 (177Lu-PSMA-I\&T) as therapy in patients with metastatic castration resistent prostate cancer (mCRPC).

The main questions are whether the 177Lu-PSMA-I\&T is safe and if it works well to treat patients with progressive mCRPC. The data and information in the study are collected under standard medical therapy and follow-up, so called real-world conditions.

Participants will:

* undergo regular radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-PSMA-I\&T
* have clinical, laboratory and imaging follow-up according to the currently available recommendation for PSMA-RLT an in line with their medical needs.
* answer study related set of questionnaires
mCRPC
DRUG: radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T
Frequency and severity of treatment related adverse event, frequency and severity of treatment related adverse events evaluated on standard blood tests (CBC, liver and kidney function)-, according to CTCAE 5.0, performed at baseline (before starting the first therapy cycle), during (before each additional therapy cycle) and at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles
Efficacy - biochemical response, -measured by changes from baseline PSA (ng/ml), according to the PCWG3, performed at baseline (before starting the first therapy cycle), during (before each additional therapy cycle) and at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles|Efficacy - imaging response, objective response rates from, evaluated on morphological imaging according to RECIST criteria and on molecular imaging according to the Consensus statements on PSMA PET/CT response assessment criteria, PSMA PET/CT performed at baseline (before starting the first therapy cycle), PSMA SPECT/CT during therapy (24-48 hours after each cycle) and PSMA PET/CT (and/or CT/MRI) at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles|Quality of life - EORTC PR25, evaluated with the standardized EORTC PR25 questionnaire, performed at baseline, before each therapy cycle and at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles|Quality of life - pain, evaluated with the standardized Brief Pain Inventory, performed at baseline, before each therapy cycle and at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles|Quality of life - Xerostomia, evaluated with the standardized Xerostomia questionnaire, performed at baseline, before each therapy cycle and at 8-14 weeks after completion of all therapy cycles
Prospective, multicenter Swiss registry study evaluating the performance of 177Lu-ITG-PSMA-1 (177Lu-PSMA-I\&T) as RLT in mCRPC.

Primary endpoint: Safety-

* frequency and severity of adverse events (measured according to CTCAE 5.0). Secondary endpoints: Efficacy
* biochemical response: best PSA response, PSA50 (\>50% decrease from baseline PSA level) and PSA response at 12 weeks

  * imaging response: Objective response rate evaluated on follow-up morphological imaging CT/MRI and/or on molecular imaging PSMA PET/CT
  * quality of life: evaluated with standardized questionnaires
