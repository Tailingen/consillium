Relmacabtagene Autoleucel As Second-Line Therapy in Adult Patients with Aggressive B-cell NHL
The primary objective of this study is to asess the efficacy of Relmacabtagene autoleucel as second-line therapy in adult patients with aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma who are ineligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to determine the antitumor activity, PK, and safety of JWCAR029(Relmacabtagene autoleucel ) in subjects who have relapsed within 12 months from, or are refractory to, a single line of immunochemotherapy for aggressive Bcell NHL and are ineligible for HSCT (as defined in the eligibility criteria). Subjects will be treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and JWCAR029.
