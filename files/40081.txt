CNS Penetration, PK and PD of Preoperative CC-90010 in Progressive/Recurrent Diffuse Astrocytoma, Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma
CC-90010-GBM-001 is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and CNS penetration of CC-90010 following short-term interval therapy (4 daily doses ) prior to surgery, in subjects with progressive or recurrent WHO Grade II Diffuse Astrocytoma, Grade III Anaplastic Astrocytoma and recurrent Glioblastoma who have failed radiation and chemotherapy, and who are candidates for surgical tumor resection as part of their salvage regimen (planned salvage resection).
