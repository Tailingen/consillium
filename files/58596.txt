18F-FDG PET Radiomics of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) radiomics in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and its additional value to the International Prognostic Index (IPI).

Several studies have shown that 18F-FDG PET radiomics is predictive of survival in DLBCL. However, to the best of the investigator's knowledge, a multi-feature radiomic signature for prognosis assessment of DLBCL has not yet been described. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether PET-based radiomics could add more prognostic values to the IPI in DLBCL.

This study aims to develop 18F-FDG PET radiomic signature, and investigate whether the radiomic signature could improve the prognostic value of the IPI score in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in DLBCL.
