Neoadjuvant Therapy of Abiraterone Plus ADT for Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate
Neoadjuvant treatment before radical prostatectomy has been proven to provide benefits on peri-operation results, especially on reduction of tumor volume and minimization of biochemical recurrence. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate Plus androgen deprivation therapy（ADT）in high-risk localized prostate cancer with intraductal carcinoma of the prostate（IDC-P）.

IDC-P is an adverse pathological entity of prostate cancer, characterized by the growth of malignant cells in pre-existing prostatic ducts and acini, and is present in high-grade disease and associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that IDC-P was significantly associated with an adverse clinical course in patients who received radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and the presence of IDC-P on the biopsy specimen was associated with a poor prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS) and a poor docetaxel response in patients with distant metastasis at the initial diagnosis. Our previous researches as well as other published data indicated that abiraterone had a better therapeutic efficacy than docetaxel as the first-line therapy in metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer（mCRPC）with IDC-P. Therefore we intended to perform this single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate Plus ADT as neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk localized prostate cancer with IDC-P. The primary endpoint is the pathologic complete response (pCR).
