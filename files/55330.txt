Radiographic bone progression was defined by the appearance of two or more new lesions on bone scan, 3 months|Phase 1 and 2: Participants With Stable Bone Disease in Post-chemotherapy and CYP17i-naïve Group, Number of participants with stable bone disease (no change). Radiographic bone progression was defined by the appearance of two or more new lesions on bone scan, 3 months|Phase 1 and 2: Participants With Stable Bone Disease in Post-CYP17i Group, Number of participants with stable bone disease (no change). Radiographic bone progression was defined by the appearance of two or more new lesions on bone scan, 3 months|Phase 1: Area Under the Plasma-Concentration-time Curve (AUCt) of ODM-201 at Steady-state, AUC(0-8h), Day 8 predose 0 h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|Phase 1: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ODM-201 at Steady-state, Day 8 predose 0 h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|Phase 1: Time to Reach the Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax) of ODM-201 at Day 1, 1 day|Phase 1: Area Under the Plasma-Concentration-time Curve (AUCt) of Major Metabolite ORM-15341 at Steady-state, AUC(0-8h), Day 8 predose 0 h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|Phase 1: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Major Metabolite ORM-15341 at Steady-state, Day 8 predose 0 h and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|Phase 1: Time to Reach the Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax) of Major Metabolite ORM-15341 at Day 1, 1 day
