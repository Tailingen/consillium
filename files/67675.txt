Tolerability and Efficacy of Tremelimumab in Combination With Gefitinib in NSCLC Patients
This is an open-label phase 1, safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy study of oral Gefitinib and IV Tremelimumab in previously treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as Erlotinib or Gefitinib. The primary objective of this phase I, is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral Gefitinib in combination with escalating doses of Tremelimumab and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives include evaluation of, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, antitumor activity of Gefitinib and Tremelimumab combination. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity or prospectively identify patients likely to respond to Tremelimumab and Gefitinib.

The biological rationale for such a study is that even though the disease is progressing it is likely that EGFR sensitive clones, although diminished under the pressure from the EGFR TKI, are still present. Therefore, withdrawing the inhibitory pressure of the EGFR TKI can potentially allow regrowth of the EGFR sensitive cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of EGFR resistant clones needs to be suppressed by another therapeutic approach. Until today no association of chemotherapy and TKI EGFR has demonstrated clinical benefit. Moreover, patients may have received chemotherapy and the likelihood of chemosensitivity is very low. So, the association of Gefitinib with immune checkpoint blockade is very attractive and may result in clinical benefit in NSCLC with EGFRmut.

DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Tremelimumab
safety and tolerability of the association between Gefitinib (fixed dose) and Tremelimumab (dose escalation), The primary objective of this phase 1 study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral Gefitinib in combination with three escalating doses of Tremelimumab and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose. Overall safety profile will be characterized by type, frequency, severity (graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCICTCAE\] Version 4.03), timing of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities in the first and in the following cycles, Up to 42 days
Anti-tumour activity of Gefitinib + Tremelimumab, To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumour activity of Gefitinib + Tremelimumab by evaluation of tumour response using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 and evaluation of Disease control rate and PFS, From day 1 cycle 1 every 8 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 6 weeks until progression or death whichever comes first assessed up to 30 months|Immunogenicity of Tremelimumab in combination with Gefitinib, Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by summarizing the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-Tremelimumab antibodies. The immunogenicity titer will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of anti-Tremelimumab antibodies., At day 1 cycle 1 and then every 8 weeks from day 1 cycle 2 until progression or death whichever comes first assessed up to 30 months|Pharmacokinetics of Gefitinib, Gefitinib pharmacokinetic parameters comprise the area under the curve from time t0 to t (AUC0-t), AUC from time t0 to the infini (AUC0-∞) and maximal concentration (Cmax), At first Tremelimumab administration and then every 4 weeks until progression or death whichever comes first assessed up to 30 months|Pharmacokinetics of Tremelimumab, Tremelimumab pharmacokinetic parameters comprise the area under the curve from time t0 to t (AUC0-t), AUC from time t0 to the infini (AUC0-∞) and maximal concentration (Cmax), Before and after injection of Tremelimumab at day 1 cycle 1 and at day 8 and day 15 of cycle 1 and then before and after injection at day 1 for every cycle (4 weeks) until progression or death whichever comes first assessed up to 30 months
