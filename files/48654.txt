Reproducibility of 18F Uptake by Solid Tumors Using PET Imaging Following Intravenous Administration of (18F) Injection
Study aimed to assess the reproducibility of PET imaging using AH111585 (18F) Injection. Subjects are evaluable if they undergo 2 administrations of AH111585 (18F) Injection (3 to 8 days apart) and the corresponding PET acquisitions, and tumors demonstrate detectable levels of 18F uptake on PET.

DRUG: Fluciclatide Injection
Test Image and Retest Image Reproducibility of Fluciclatide Injection ([18F]AH111585) Uptake by Solid Tumors Following Intravenous Administration of AH111585 (18F) Injection Via PET Imaging., Mean relative differences of Standardized uptake value (SUV) following intravenous administration of AH111585 (F18) Injection between the two PET imaging sessions., Forty minutes, 65 minutes and 90 minutes post Fluciclatide administration.
The Safety of Greater Than or Equal to 2 Administrations, Each of a Maximum of 370MBq, Fluciclatide Injection (AH111585 (18F) Injection) in Subjects With Solid Primary or Metastatic Tumors., Safety was monitored throughout the duration of the subject's participation., Up to 8 weeks post contrast administration.
