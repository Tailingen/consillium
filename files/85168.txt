Validation of a Nutrition Screening Tool
The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of two nutrition screening tools to identify inpatients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition. The two tools are the Royal Marsden Abridged Adult Nutrition Screening Tool (AANST) and the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)\[10\] The tools will be compared with the currently accepted gold standard, Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Both screening tools are in the form of scored questionnaires and are suitable for electronic input.

The ultimate objective is to select an adult inpatient nutrition screening tool with the highest sensitivity for future use in the oncology inpatient setting in order to allow prompt commencement of an appropriate nutrition care plan.
