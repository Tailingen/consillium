Surgical and Functional Outcomes of Rectourethral Fistulas Surgery With Gracilis Flap Interposition After Localized Prostatic Cancer Treatment.
Prostate cancer is the first cancer amongst men with more than 50000 cases per year in France. Surgical, radiation, frost, or ultrasound induced rectourethral fistula is a rare complication (\<1%) of localized prostatic cancer treatment but hard to manage. Different types of treatment exist: conservatory, trans-sphinteric (York-Masson), transanal, perineal, with or without muscle flap interposition. Gracilis flap interposition for rectourethral fistula management is a promising technique but few cases are described and functional results are scarce.

The aim of this study is to present surgical and functional outcomes of rectourethral fistulas surgery with gracilis flap interposition after treatment of localized prostate cancer.
Rectourethral Fistula
PROCEDURE: Gracilis flap interposition for rectouretral fistula management
Urinary continence, Urinary Symptom Profile form (from 0 to 39), a higher score indicating a worse outcome., 3 months after surgery|Fecal continence, St. Marks form (from 0 to 26), a higher score indicating a worse outcome., 3 months after surgery|Lower extremity functional, No validated form exist for surgical consequences after gracilis retrieval. The form used in this study is specific (Difficulty scale for walking, kneeling, crossing the legs ; limitation of movements since the operation (yes/no and which one) (From 0 to 20), a higher score indicating a worse outcome., 3 months after surgery|Surgical scarring, The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (From 7 to 70), a higher score indicating a worse outcome., 3 months after surgery|Global satisfaction of the surgery, Patients will give a number to measure their global satisfaction of the surgery (From 1 to 10), a higher score indicating a better outcome., 3 months after surgery
