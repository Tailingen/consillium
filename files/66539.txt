A Trial of C-met Kinase Inhibitor HS-10241 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
To investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of C-met Kinase Inhibitor HS-10241 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours that are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of HS-10241 will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HS-10241 in advanced cancer patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of HS-10241 will be observed in advanced cancer patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase II.
