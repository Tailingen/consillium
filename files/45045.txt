This is a first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of WTX-124, a conditionally-activated IL-2 prodrug, when administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. Part 1 of the study is dose escalation of WTX-124, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 is dose expansion and is comprised of six arms in which WTX-124 will be administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab to patients with advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma or advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
