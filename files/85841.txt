ENB-GS-TBLB for the Diagnosis of PPLs
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with a Guide Sheath(ENB-GS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) .
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: ENB|PROCEDURE: GS-TBLB-X-ray
The Difference of Diagnostic Value of ENB-GS-TBLB as Compared to GS-TBLB, The diagnostic yield in the ENB-GS-TBLB and GS-TBLB group was 87.2% and 61% individually., Up to half year
The Duration Time Difference of ENB-GS-TBLB With Fluoroscopy as Compared to GS-TBLB With Fluoroscopy Alone, Including total procedure timeï¼Œtotal X-ray time, duration time for finding lesions and X-ray time for finding lesions., Up to half year
The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and bronchial brushing using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with a guide sheath (GS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) with radiographic fluoroscopy.The study is designed as a two-center prospective randomized controlled trial. The participating centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscope department, Shanghai chest Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University, China. Department of pulmonary medicine, Shanghai ZhongShan Hospitial affiliated to Shanghai FuDan University, China.Patients are divided into two groups, ENB-GS-TBLB-X-ray group and GS-TBLB-X-ray group.Each subject will be randomized to each group.The study is expected to enroll 60 patients at 2 centers (Shanghai Chest Hospital: 40, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital: 20).
