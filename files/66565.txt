Alternating Treatment With Fruquintinib and Bevacizumab Plus Capecitabine as Maintenance Therapy After First-Line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized parallel-group phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib alternating with Bevacizumab plus Capecitabine versus Bevacizumab plus Capecitabine as maintenance therapy following first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Approximately 40 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have achieved partial remission after completing 8 cycles of standard first-line chemotherapy (FOLFOX combined with Bevacizumab) but are still in un-resectable state will be assigned to 2 maintenance treatment groups by randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive Fruquintinib alternating with Bevacizumab plus Capecitabine (Arm A) or Bevacizumab plus Capecitabine (Arm B). The study contains a safety lead-in phase in which the safety and efficacy of Fruquintinib alternating with Bevacizumab plus Capecitabine will be assessed in approximately 20 patients. All patients from Arm A and Arm B will be treated until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, or other criteria for ending the study (whichever occurs earlier). The study will evaluate PFS, ORR, DCR, OS and safety.
