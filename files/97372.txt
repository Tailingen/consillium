Cerebral Blood Perfusion Changes After General Anesthesia for Craniotomy
Few studies look into cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes during emergence from general anesthesia for craniotomy. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate CBF changes during emergence from general anesthesia for craniotomy, through monitoring blood oxygen saturation of jugular vein bulb and transcranial Doppler.

30 patients undergoing selective craniotomy (craniotomy group) for supratentorial brain tumor removal and 30 patients undergoing selective abdominal surgery (abdominal surgery group) are planned to be enrolled in the study. Mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (Vmca), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood oxygen saturation of jugular vein bulb (SjvO2) (only measured in craniotomy group)and arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) will be measured before general anesthesia, at tracheal extubation, and 30,60, 90, 120 min after extubation in both groups.
