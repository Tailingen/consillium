Trial of Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Elective Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery: Oral and Systemic Versus Systemic Antibiotics
The purpose of this study is to determine optimal prophylactic antibiotics administration method in elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: cefmetazole|DRUG: kanamycin/metronidazole
Incidence and classification of surgical site infection (SSI), Within the first 30 days after surgery
Incidence of colitis, other infectious diseases and other postoperative complications., Within the first 30 days after surgery
The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who undergo elective colorectal surgery is now accepted universally. But the rout of administration should be systematic, oral, or both is controversial. Furthermore, although many trails have been performed, no trial limited to laparoscopic surgery is performed. We compare 2 approaches - oral and systemic versus systemic antibiotic prophylaxis - in limited to elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
