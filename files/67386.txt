The Diagnostic Value of Bronchoscopic Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (nCLE) As a Real-time Detection Tool for Diagnosing Peripheral Lung Cancer: a Multi-centre Randomised Controlled Trial
The goal of this prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled clinical study is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy and safety of nCLE guided lung biopsy in patients with for peripheral lung nodules under the assistance of navigation bronchoscopy (NB) and radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), and assess whether the biopsy techniques, namely transbronchial crybiopsy (TBCB) and transbronchial forceps biopsy (TBFB), would influence the diagnostic efficacy and safety of nCLE guided biopsy.

Participants will divided into nCLE-NB-rEBUS-forcep biopsy group, nCLE-NB-rEBUS-TBCB group, NB-rEBUS-forcep biopsy group, and NB-rEBUS-TBCB group at a 1:1:1:1 ratio by using central, computerized random sequence, and then undertake nCLE-NB-rEBUS-forcep biopsy, nCLE-NB-rEBUS-TBCB, NB-rEBUS-forcep biopsy, and NB-rEBUS-TBCB according to the group.

Researchers will compare the diagnostic yield and incidence of adverse events of the four biopsy techniques.
