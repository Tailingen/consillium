Single Fraction Intraoperative Radiotherapy
This clinical trial is being conducted to find out the effects (good and bad) of giving the full radiation treatment for breast cancer as a single dose of radiation during surgery for breast cancer. This single fraction intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons will study the toxicity, local control and cosmetic outcome.
Invasive Ductal and Invasive Lobular Breast Carcinoma|Stage 0 Breast Carcinoma|Stage I Breast Carcinoma|Stage II Breast Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Intraoperative Radiotherapy
Toxicity Assessment, Assessment of acute toxicity of breast irradiation according to CTC-toxicity Scoring - system:

* End of initial surgical phase: Week 1, 4
* First Follow-up investigation: Month 2 Assessment of late toxicity according to NSABP scoring-systems at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, 5 years
Cosmetic Evaluation, Assessment of cosmetic outcome according to 5-point scoring system

* Week 1, 2; Month 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60
* At yearly follow-up (photodocumentation in standardized positions) for 5 years, 5 years|Recurrence Assessment, Recurrence is assessed at month 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 5 years
For patients with certain types of breast cancer, one standard treatment is breast conserving surgery or lumpectomy (surgery to remove abnormal tissue or cancer from the breast and a small amount of normal tissue around it) followed by breast radiation. The radiation treatment in this situation usually lasts 3 to 5 1/2 weeks followed by 5-8 daily localized irradiation (or boost) treatments at the site where the lump was removed. During this study, the single dose of electron irradiation given at the surgical site during the operation will replace the radiation given after surgery.
