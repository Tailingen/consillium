Exploration on the Value of MRD Based on ctDNA Detection in Predicting Recurrence of Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Based on the unique patented MONOD and Methyl Titan methylation sequencing technology on lung cancer tissue and blood samples, a lung cancer MRD monitoring panel is designed. The panel is used to detect molecular residual disease of stage IB-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer patients underwent radical surgery, explore personalized analysis models, and conduct research on recurrence monitoring for non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
2-year recurrence-free survival rate, Recurrence-free survival means the time from the date of surgery to the first recorded date of disease recurrence or patient death, whichever occurs earlier. 2-year recurrence-free survival rate means the rate of patients survive without recurrence for 2 years or more., Up to 24 months
Median recurrence-free survival, Recurrence-free survival means the time from the date of surgery to the first recorded date of disease recurrence or patient death, whichever occurs earlier. Median recurrence-free survival means the median value of recurrence-free survival., up to 60 months
