Study of LY01610 in Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter，randomized, open label, active-controlled, parallel-group study comparing efficacy and safety of LY01610(Irinotecan hydrochloride liposome Injection) and Topotecan in Patients with Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan hydrochloride liposome Injection|DRUG: Topotecan
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death., From the date of randomization to the date of death or last contact, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 52 month
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is the time from randomization to the first documented objective disease progression (PD) using RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease, death or last tumor assessment or further anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 52 months|Overall response rate, Overall response rate (ORR) will be the best response obtained in any evaluation according to RECIST v.1.1, At baseline and every six weeks (± one week) through study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall survival rate at 1 year, Overall survival rate at 1 year is defined as the percentage of people who are still alive at 12 months after randomization., At 12 months|Duration of response, Duration of response (DoR) will be calculated from the date of first documentation of response per RECIST v.1.1 (complete or partial response, whichever occurs first) to the date of documented PD or death, From the date of first documentation of complete or partial response to the date of documented progression disease, death or last contact, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 52 months|Patient-reported outcomes, To measure the quality of life of patients, EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13 questionnaire will be analyzed, At baseline and every six weeks (± one week) through study completion, an average of 1 year|Maximum plasma concentration, Maximum plasma concentration of total Irinotecan，free Irinotecan ，and its metabolite SN-38，SN-38G (Cmax) in 20\~24 subjects treated with LY01610, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2（each Cycle is 14 days）|Time to maximum plasma concentration, Time to maximum plasma concentration of total Irinotecan，free Irinotecan ，and its metabolite SN-38，SN-38G (Tmax) in 20\~24 subjects treated with LY01610, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2（each Cycle is 14 days）|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total Irinotecan，free Irinotecan ，and its metabolite SN-38，SN-38G (AUC) in 20\~24 subjects treated with LY01610, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2（each Cycle is 14 days）|Elimination half-life, Elimination half-life of total Irinotecan，free Irinotecan，and its metabolite SN-38，SN-38G (t1/2) in 20\~24 subjects treated with LY01610, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2（each Cycle is 14 days）|Plasma concentrations for Population PK Analyses, Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration-time data for total Irinotecan，free Irinotecan，and its metabolite SN-38，SN-38G will be analyzed using population pharmacokinetic methods in all subjects treated with LY01610 and identify the effect of covariates on pharmacokinetic parameters in the subject population, From Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and up to Pre-dose of Cycle 2（each Cycle is 14 days）|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, Safety analyses (adverse events and laboratory analyses) will be performed using the safety population, defined as all patients receiving any study drug, From the date of randomization through study completion, an average of 1 year
A multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LY01610 versus topotecan in the second-line treatment of patients with recurrent SCLC who were diagnosed by histopathology and/or cytology and had disease progression after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, to conduct a population pharmacokinetics (PopPk) study, and to explore the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics properties, efficacy and safety of this product.
