Web-Based Communication Education for Breast Cancer Survivorship Care
This two-phase research plan will develop and test a culturally relevant, web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare. The intervention aims to empower Chinese cancer patients to effectively communicate with different providers in different healthcare settings.

This two-phase study develops and tests the usability and efficacy of a culturally relevant, web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare, in improving Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors' competence, perceived control, and self-efficacy in cancer care communication (intermediate outcomes), and patient-reported symptoms, adherence to breast cancer survivorship care guidelines, and quality of life (distal outcomes) versus the usual care control arm. In Phase I, community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles will be used to develop the intervention to educate participants about culture and communication by demonstrating how to ask for and verify information with doctors and use personalized symptom reports, and by providing question prompt lists for doctor visits. In Phase II, the intervention will be tested in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). Using cases from Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program, California Cancer Registry, Maryland Cancer Registry, and clinics from California, 118 Chinese immigrant women (diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer and 1-3 years post-diagnosis) will be enrolled and randomized to either the E-Talkcare intervention or a usual care control arm. Participants will be interviewed via telephone at baseline (i.e., pre-randomization), 3-, and 6-months post-randomization.
