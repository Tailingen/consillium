BGB-43395 Alone or as Part of Combination Therapies in Participants With Breast Cancer and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a dose escalation and dose expansion study to compare how well BGB-43395, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor, works as monotherapy or in combination with either fulvestrant or letrozole in participants with hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC) and other advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to explore the recommended dosing for BGB-43395.

Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have confirmed CR or PR assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an overall response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drugs to the date of the first determination of objective response by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1b: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting â‰¥ 24 weeks., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1b: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug(s) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory assessments., Up to approximately 60 months|Phase 1a: Observed Plasma Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Observed Plasma Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a: Half-life (t1/2) of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1b: Plasma concentrations of BGB-43395 and its metabolite, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 5 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
This is a dose escalation and dose expansion study to compare how well BGB-43395, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor, works as monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant, letrozole, or elacestrant in participants with hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC) and other advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to explore the recommended dosing for BGB-43395.
