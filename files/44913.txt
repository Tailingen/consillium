A Study to Compare Two Avastin-Based Treatment Regimens for the Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multicenter trial comparing two oxaliplatin/Avastin-based treatment sequences as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. The study is designed to compare the efficacy of these two treatment sequences with respect to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Avastin
To compare the efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), of FOLFOX/Avastin followed by FOLFIRI/Avastin versus FOLFOX/Avastin followed by 5-FU/LV/Avastin as first-line therapy for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.
To evaluate the tolerability of sequential treatment in subjects and to evaluate the safety of an irinotecan/Avastin-based regimen versus a 5-FU/Avastin regimen for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.
