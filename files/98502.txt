Safety and Efficacy of Lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in Participants With Incurable/Non-metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (MK-7902-012/E7080-G000-318/LEAP-012)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in combination with TACE versus TACE plus oral and intravenous (IV) placebos in participants with incurable, non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in combination with TACE is superior to placebo plus TACE with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Lenvatinib|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Oral Placebo|DRUG: IV Placebo|PROCEDURE: TACE
Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to ~43 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~95 months
PFS per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to mRECIST as assessed by BICR., Up to ~43 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per mRECIST, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable \[enhancement in the arterial phase\] target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions). Responses are according to mRECIST as assessed by BICR., Up to ~95 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per mRECIST, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR (disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable \[enhancement in the arterial phase\] target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions), or stable disease (SD). Responses are according to mRECIST as assessed by BICR., Up to ~95 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per mRECIST, DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR (disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable \[enhancement in the arterial phase\] target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions) until the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to mRECIST as assessed by BICR., Up to ~95 months|Time to Progression (TTP) per mRECIST, TTP is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression. Responses are according to mRECIST as assessed by BICR., Up to ~95 months|Percentage of Participants Who Experience At Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experience at least one AE will be reported., Up to ~95 months|Percentage of Participants Who Experience At Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE), An SAE is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs a hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, is associated with an overdose, or is another important medical event. The percentage of participants who experience at least one SAE will be reported., Up to ~95 months|Percentage of Participants Who Experience At Least One Hepatic Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), Percentage of participants with Hepatic ECIs not due to disease progression or TACE as assessed by the investigator will be reported., Up to ~95 months|Percentage of Participants Who Discontinue Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who discontinue study drug due to an AE will be reported., Up to ~95 months|ORR per RESCIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~95 months|DCR per RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters), or SD.
