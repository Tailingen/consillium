Oral Inulin in Combination With Fruquintinib Plus Sintilimab as Third- or Further-line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a single-center exploratory clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of Oral Inulin in Combination With Fruquintinib Plus Sintilimab as Third- or Further-line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Inulin
Intestinal microbiota diversity, abundance and taxonomic information, Total genomic DNA was extracted from the feces of all patients and metagenomic sequencing was performed. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were used to evaluate the diversity of intestinal microbiota. Abundance and taxonomic information were obtained through taxonomic annotation of the sequencing results., 6 months after the recruitment of the last subject.|adverse events, Safety will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0., from the date of first dose to the 30 days post the last dose
Objective remission rate (ORR), was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall assessment of complete or partial remission. 95% confidence intervals were calculated separately for each group rate using the Clopper-pearson method., 6 months after the recruitment of the last subject.|Overall survival (OS), was defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause. For patients whose death had not been reported at the time of analysis, the date of their last known survival was used as the censored date., from date of randomization until the date of progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time (in days) from patient enrollment to disease progression or death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate was defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall assessment was complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease., from date of randomization until the date of progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Duration of remission (DOR), The time interval from the onset of response (when CR or PR is first identified) to progression or death, whichever occurs., from date of the first documentation of response to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year|Concentration of various serum metabolites, Use LC-MS/MS to detect and quantify various substances including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, organic acids, amino acids, sugars, flavonoids, nucleotides, steroid hormones and other substances in serum., 6 months after the recruitment of the last subject.|Concentration of various plasma Cytokine Changes, Luminex multi-factor liquid phase analysis technology is used to detect plasma cytokines. The detection indicators include IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A and TNF-α and other cytokines., 6 months after the recruitment of the last subject.|Frequency of peripheral blood lymphocyte, Use flow cytometry to detect the frequency of CD4 positive T cells, CD8 positive T cells, natural killer cells, regulatory T cells and other immune cells in peripheral blood., 6 months after the recruitment of the last subject.
Correlation between dietary fiber intake and progression-free survival, Patients' dietary fiber intake was collected through dietary questionnaires, and the correlation with progression-free survival was calculated., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year
This was a prospective, two-arm, single-center, exploratory phase I study, randomized 2: 1 into an intervention group (Fruquintinib combined with Sintilimab and inulin group) and a control group (Fruquintinib combined with Sintilimab group). Fruquintinib: 4 mg/d, QD po, administered continuously for 2 weeks with a 1-week discontinuation; Sintilimab 200 mg, I.V., D1, administered every 3 weeks; Inulin: 5 g/d, qd po, in the first week, and 10 g/d, bid po, starting in the second week; Combination therapy was administered every 3 weeks as a treatment cycle. Combination therapy was administered until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity.

The study was divided into 3 phases: a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Tumor status was assessed using imaging methods every 6 weeks (±7 days) until disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or death (during patient treatment) or intolerable toxicity, and tumor treatment and survival status after disease progression were recorded. Safety observations included changes in AE, laboratory test values, vital signs, and electrocardiographic changes.
