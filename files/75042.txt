Study Evaluating Mitoxantrone in Multiple Sclerosis
The purpose of this study is to show the dose-response relationship of three doses of mitoxantrone with regard to efficacy in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and to show the safety and tolerability of mitoxantrone in these patients.
