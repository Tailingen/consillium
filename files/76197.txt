CD19 CAR T Cells in Patients With Resistant or Refractory CD19+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
In this single-center, open-label, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20 resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients will be enrolled. CD19 CAR T cells will be administered by i.v. injection as a using a "split dose" (total dose of 5x10\^6/kg-5x10\^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T cells in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.

BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR T cells
The complete remission (CR) rate, Participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment, an expected average of 12 months.
Disease-free survival (DFS), From the date of complete remission(CR) until the date of documented relapse,assessed up to 60 months.|Number of adverse event of CD19 CAR T cells treatment, Participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment, an expected average of 24 months.|Grade of adverse event of CD19 CAR T cells treatment, Participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment, an expected average of 24 months.|Duration of in vivo survival of CD19 CAR T cells., Participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment, an expected average of 24 months.
In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20 resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients will be enrolled. Patients will be diagnosed according to morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic and molecular(MICM) criteria, including bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and molecular examination. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCRÎ¶:4-1BB,administered by i.v. injection as a using a "split dose" (total dose of 5x10\^6/kg-5x10\^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2. This protocol will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there are no effective therapies known at this time. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.
