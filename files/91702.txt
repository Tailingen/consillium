Tebentafusp Regimen Versus Investigator's Choice in Previously Treated Advanced Melanoma (TEBE-AM)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tebentafusp-based regimens, including tebentafusp monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 vs investigator choice (including clinical trials of investigational agents, salvage therapy per local standard of care \[SoC\], best supportive care \[BSC\] on protocol survivor follow up) in patients with advanced non-ocular melanoma.

This is a phase 3 (as upon conversion to phase 3 there were no changes to the arms listed herein), multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tebentafusp as monotherapy (Arm A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Arm B) compared with standard of care or best supportive care (Arm C) in participants with non-ocular advanced melanoma who have progressed on a prior anti-PD(L)1 regimen, received an approved anti-CTLA4 regimen and, if the participant has a BRAF mutation, a prior BRAF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) regimen.
