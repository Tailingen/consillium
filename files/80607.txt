NAVAH Impact on Radiation Therapy Completion in Black Breast & Prostate Cancer Patients
African-Americans have disparately limited access to optimal cancer care. They have the highest overall cancer death rate and shortest survival time of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. Elucidation of disparities in access to cancer care are important since previous work has indicated that when equal access to RT in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) prospective randomized trials is granted, race does not independently affect outcomes, a finding similar to work conducted in Level I evidence-proven optimal management of curable neurologic conditions. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in African-American women and Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in African-American men. African-American breast \& prostate cancer participants are less likely to receive standard-of-care radiation therapy.

Previous work has identified that compared to Caucasian women with breast cancer, African-American women are 48% more likely to have RT omission during treatment, 167% less likely to receive timely completion of RT after breast-conserving surgery, 40% less likely to complete RT, and significantly more likely to experience RT treatment delays. Shorter course radiation therapy may reduce disparities in radiation therapy care facing African-American breast cancer participants.

BEHAVIORAL: NAVAH
Evaluation of barriers to navigator access, Survey-based methods will be used to assess barriers facing under-represented minority cancer patient access to patient navigation. This study will use a patient-completed, culturally sensitive survey adapted from "Walking Forward," a patient navigator program providing culturally appropriate community education on cancer, screening and treatment, to include barriers to specific RT regimens, and concerns regarding transportation., Immediately following radiotherapy treatment
Assess the impact of patient navigation on patient access to radiation oncology care, Qualitative mechanisms will be used to assess the impact of patient navigation on patient access to radiation oncology care and consequently utilization of standard of care modalities. This study will use patient-completed surveys to evaluate the impact of patient navigation on access to short-course RT by using a culturally sensitive survey adapted from "Walking Forward", a patient navigator program providing culturally appropriate community education on cancer, screening and treatmen. The feedback provided by patients on the impact of patient navigation will be compared- before and after RT, and will also be compared against feedback from patients who did not received patient navigation., Immediately following radiotherapy treatment|Minority financial toxicity differences, This study will use patient-completed surveys to evaluate the impact of financial hardship in African-American breast cancer patients. Patient scores from an evidence-based tool, "The COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity-Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (COST-FACIT)" will be used to compare financial hardship in each group of patients with early-stage breast cancer who have received a lumpectomy. Surveys will investigate differences in financial toxicity survery scores experienced by underrepresented minorities receiving conventional versus short-course RT., Immediately following radiotherapy treatment
