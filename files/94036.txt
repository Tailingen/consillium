Distant Metastases and Long-Term Survival After Complete Resection of Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Appendix
The aim of the present project is to evaluate the frequency of distant metastases and clinically relevant relapse and mortality, respectively, of aNEN (Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Appendix) measuring 1 - 2 cm.

The investigators hypothesize that the mortality rate of aNET (Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Appendix) measuring 1 - 2cm is less than 1%. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that regional lymph node metastases of aNET measuring 1 - 2 cm are clinically not relevant and are not associated with reduced survival. The investigators therefore hypothesize that oncological right-sided hemicolectomy has no impact on long-term survival after complete resection of aNET measuring 1 - 2 cm and that the malignant potential quo ad vitam of these tumors is lower than the risk of oncological hemicolectomy.
