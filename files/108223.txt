Trial of Vaccine Therapy With mRNA- Transfected Dendritic Cells in Patients With Androgen Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Determination of safety and toxicity of vaccination with mRNA transfected DC (based on blood samples, and adverse events).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

Determine immunological response to the vaccine (induction of specific T-cell response) and assessment of tumour response.
