Study of Serum Tumor Markers of HBV Associated HCC
In this study, the investigators will detect the expression of four potential HBV-related HCC biomarkers: PGIR,FAM3C,LAMB1 and SDC4 in tumor tissues and peripheral blood, to explore the specific molecular markers for the early diagnosis of HBV-related HCC.
HCC
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: tumor tissue and blood tests
Detection of RNA and protein for diagnosis, Detect the content of the RNA and protein in tumor and serum, 6 months
Paired hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissues were selected, and the mRNA and protein expressions of the PGIR,FAM3C,LAMB1 and SDC4 biomarkers in tissues were detected by RT-PCR, western Blot and immunohistochemical analysis. At the same time, healthy subjects were selected as the control group, and mRNA and protein expression levels of the above molecules in blood were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. At the same time, the correlation between the above biomarkers and the clinical data of patients, such as diagnosis, pathological grading, recurrence, metastasis and survival time was statistically analyzed.
