DC Vaccine Combined With CIK Cells in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
The aim of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells (DC) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DC, which engineered to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: adenovirus-transfected DC + CIK
objective tumor response (CR+PR) as measured by RECIST criteria, 4 weeks after DC/CIK treatment
number of participants with adverse events, 3 days within DC/CIK treatment
