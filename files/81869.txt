Safety Study to Assess Opiate Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms in Opioid Dependent Patients
This study will evaluate whether crushed EMBEDA capsules induce clinical opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms in opioid-dependent patients with chronic non-cancer pain who are stabilized on EMBEDA.

Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Prior to dose, 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr post-dose|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to End of Dosing Interval (AUC0-τ) During the Treatment Phase, Average AUC0-τ for Morphine, Naltrexone and 6-β-Naltrexol reported. τ=24 hours, Prior to dose, 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr post-dose|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to the Time of Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-last) During the Treatment Phase, Average AUC0-last for Morphine, Naltrexone and 6-β-Naltrexol. Area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time zero to the last measured concentration., Prior to dose, 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr post-dose|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - ∞)] During the Treatment Phase, AUC (0 - ∞)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - ∞). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - ∞). Average AUC 0-∞ for Morphine, Naltrexone and 6-β-Naltrexol reported., Prior to dose, 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr post-dose

The decision to terminate the trial was due to a lack of study drug supply. Decision was not based on any safety concerns. The date of the notification of termination letter was March 11, 2011.
