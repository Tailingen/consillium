Short Course Radiation Therapy Followed by Pre-operative Chemotherapy and Surgery in High-risk Rectal Cancer
Patients with a primary rectal cancer without detectable distant metastasis who after locoregional therapy only, meaning preoperative radio(chemo)therapy plus surgery have at least a 40% risk of not having a CRM negative resection or a recurrence, local or distant, within three years will be treated with the short course 5 x 5 Gy radiation scheme followed by four cycles of combination chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) and TME surgery

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate and clinical complete response (cCR) rate, pCR assessed at pathological examination of the surgical specimen, cCR at clinical and radiological (MRI) examination, pCR assessed directly after surgery and cCR 12 months after end of treatment if no surgery is performed (cCR)]

The multicentre, multinational RAPIDO (Rectal cancer And Pre-operative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation, EudraCT number 2010-023957-12) closed patient entry in June 2016 after having randomised the planned number of 920 patients. In the study, patients were randomised to conventional chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to 50 Gy with capecitabine followed by surgery or to short-course radiotherapy (scRT, 5 x 5 Gy), 6 cycles of oxaliplatin-capecitabine (CAPOX) followed by surgery. In the CRT arm, adjuvant chemotherapy with 8 cycles of CAPOX was optional. At the time of closure of the RAPIDO study, it was discussed in Uppsala whether CRT should be the reference treatment for these high-risk rectal cancers, the experimental treatment or an alternative. Influenced by a Polish study reported by Bujko et al in 2016 with a similar design comparing CRT with scRT followed by 3 cycles of FOLFOX), it was decided that the reference treatment for patient with primary rectal cancer at high risk of failing either locally or systemically should be scRT followed by 4 cycles of CAPOX and surgery. This regimen, identical to the experimental arm in a Chinese trial (Stellar trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02533271), preliminarily revealing promising pCR rates has since then been the reference treatment for patients having the same inclusion criteria as in the RAPIDO trial. Other centres in Sweden have also decided to use this regimen as reference treatment. A formal protocol is written and approved.
