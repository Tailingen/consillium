This study evaluated the clinical outcome of exercise management on patients with endometrial cancer treated with fertility preservation, including the effect of complete response rate, complete response time, recurrence rate, recurrence time, etc., and physical composition, to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity on weight management.
Endometrium Cancer|Physical Activity|Weight Management
BEHAVIORAL: Physical activity
Body weight, Body weight measured naked or wearing work clothes of known weight, an electronic weight scale is used to measure, Enrollment，four months after the intervention|BMI, Body mass index is a standard commonly used in the world to measure the degree of body fat and whether it is healthy.

The formula is BMI= weight ÷ height\*height, Enrollment，four months after the intervention|physical activity level, Physical activity energy was calculated using the formula of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Calculation Manual: Physical activity amount (MEt-minutes /week)= physical activity intensity MET value × physical activity time (minutes)/ day × activity days., Enrollment，four months after the intervention
serum total cholesterol, Total cholesterol is the sum of all lipoproteins in the blood.The measurement was made by drawing venous blood. Suitable level for adults: 2.83\~5.20mmol/L(110\~200mg/dl), Enrollment，four months after the intervention|Waist Hip Ratio, It is an indicator of the distribution of human body fat. It is the ratio of the waist and abdomen circumference marked by the umbilicus to the hip circumference marked by the anterior superior spine of the iliac (cm)., Enrollment，four months after the intervention|triglyceride, Serum triglyceride determination is a routine item in lipid analysis. The measurement was made by drawing venous blood. Normal reference value of serum triglyceride: 0.45 \~ 1.69mmol/L, Enrollment，four months after the intervention
