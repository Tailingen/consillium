Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Food Effect, Safety and Efficacy of Oral Azacitidine
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine when administered once daily as two 150-mg tablets, including the effect of food, and to evaluate the bioavailability of oral azacitidine 300-mg when administered as two 150-mg tablets relative to three 100-mg tablets.
