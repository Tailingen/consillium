Gene Expression in Renal Transplant Patients With Field Actinic Keratosis Undergoing MetvixÂ® Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
The aim of this study is to determine possible molecular changes on large scale gene expression profiling after treatment with Metvix photodynamic therapy (PDT) of actinic keratoses (AK) and cancerised field in renal transplant recipients.
Actinic Keratosis
PROCEDURE: Metvix PDT
Percent Change From Baseline in Lesion Count at Week 18, Percent Change in Lesion Counts at Week 18: Week 18 count minus Baseline count divided by Baseline count multiplied by 100., Baseline and Week 18.
Global Percent Change From Baseline in AK Lesion Count in the Target Field (Including New and Recurrent Lesions) at Month15, Baseline and Month15
In this study, the whole target area defined by the investigator will be treated by Metvix PDT: this means that both lesions and sub-clinical lesions will be exposed to Metvix PDT. Biopsies will be performed in both regions: lesional and peri-lesional ones. This will allow us to compare pre and post treatment molecular changes that occurred in these regions and so to evaluate if Metvix PDT acts on the sub-clinical lesions.
