The Effect of Music Applied During Chemotherapy on Anxiety, Nausea and Satisfaction Levels
Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses natural or synthetic chemicals and biological agents to kill rapidly proliferating cells. As chemotherapeutic drugs prevent the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, they also inhibit the growth of normal cells such as intestinal and oral mucosal epithelium, bone marrow cells, and hair follicle cells. During chemotherapy treatment, which is widely used in the treatment of cancer cases and considered one of the most effective methods of cancer treatment, individuals; may experience side effects such as nausea-vomiting, loss of appetite, mouth ulcers, pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and changes in their skin and nails.

There are several factors that can trigger anxiety in cancer patients: fear of cancer and its treatment-related side effects, fear of relapse after treatment, uncertainty, concerns about changing roles and relationships, and fear of death. Treatment methods are available for a variety of side effects and negative effects experienced by cancer patients. These methods include pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. For example, benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat anxiety in cancer patients. If benzodiazepines are not adequate, low-dose antipsychotics can be used. However, benzodiazepines and their derivatives may reduce respiratory function, induce sedation, and cause confusion.

Music is an example of non-pharmacological cognitive-behavioral treatment that is used to control negative symptoms in many fields. The use of music for healing is easy, has no side effects, and is beneficial for physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Anxiety and fear can be reduced by therapeutic music, which increases endorphin secretion and positive emotions. Treatment of serious illnesses such as cancer requires a holistic approach that includes psychological, social, and spiritual support in addition to pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine how different types of music affect cancer patients' anxiety and satisfaction during chemotherapy.
