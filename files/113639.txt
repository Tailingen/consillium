A Study of LM-108 in Combination With Toripalimab in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
Based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) against the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria for Solid Tumor Efficacy, To evaluate the efficacy of LM-108 in combination with Toripalimab in patients with advanced malignant solid tumours with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR who have failed previous anti-PD-1 /PD-L1 therapy.
