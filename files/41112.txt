Awareness Enhancing Interventions
The purpose of this study is to determine if increasing awareness and, thus, enhancing positive attitudes about research, prior to recruitment attempts, will increase participation in cancer clinical research among African American (AA) cancer survivors so that recruitment efforts can focus on the most optimal and cost- effective approaches

Recruitment Yield, measured by the proportion of targeted survivors who, at the time of the recruitment call, after the screening process is complete, decide to participate in AMPLIFI., within 3 months of receiving intervention
In this project, 2000 AA potential AMPLIFI project participants will be randomized to the awareness-enhancing intervention (AWEI) or to the comparison condition in which they do not receive AWEI intervention but only the Adapting Multiple Behavior Interventions that Effectively Improve Cancer Survivor Health (AMPLIFI) basic recruitment strategy (No AWEI). Randomization for the AWEI Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will occur soon after the AMPLIFI recruitment letter is sent, and AWEI interventions will be delivered over a two-week period between the AMPLIFI recruitment invitation letter and the AMPLIFI recruitment call. Survivors randomized to AWEI intervention will be exposed to 8 different combinations of the AWEI components according to different types of strategies and type of information reflecting the survivor voice or not. Subsequent to the AMPLIFI recruitment call, a 20% random sample of cancer survivors will be surveyed over the phone to assess intervention fidelity.
