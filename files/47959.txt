Risk Adapted Therapy of Hodgkin Lymphoma in Upper Egypt
determine if radiotherapy could be safely omitted for early hodgkin lymphoma responder patients without compromising outcome
Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma
RADIATION: radiotherapy
assess the outcome of pediatric patients with HL treated with risk- and response-adjusted therapy, determine if radiotherapy could be safely omitted for early responder patients without compromising outcome, it can be assessed by decrease in lymph node volume ,Volumes are approximated as ellipsoids. If a, b, c denote the principal axes of the ellipsoid the volume is calculated as V= (a x b x c)/2, 2 years
Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for around 40% of all pediatric lymphomas and is the most prevalent cancer among adolescents and young adults. With combinations of chemotherapy and radiation, Hodgkin's lymphoma is roughly 80% curable, placing it among the most treatable cancers . Since the introduction of combination chemotherapy treatments 20 years ago, the prognosis for children with Hodgkin's lymphoma has improved. The treatment is mostly influenced by the stage of the disease at diagnosis, histology, existence of "B"-symptoms, and the presence of bulky disease. Nonetheless, 20% of patients do not achieve long-term remission, and around 20% experience treatment-related side effects such as secondary malignancies, infertility, cardiovascular disease, and organ malfunction following chemo-radiation .Studies of long-term therapy side effects were made possible by the significant number of survivors. The goal of therapy optimization protocols for pediatric patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma is to maintain excellent tumor control while limiting adverse effects and long-term consequences . It is critical to stratify patients based on reliable prognostic factors at presentation and according to the rapidity of response into low-risk (LR) patients who would benefit from less aggressive therapy, avoiding unnecessary toxic side effects, and high-risk (HR) patients who should be subjected to intensified therapy to reduce the rate of treatment failures and relapses .
