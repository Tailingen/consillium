A Phase 1b/2a Study Evaluating AMG 232 in Metastatic Melanoma
Phase 1b/2a, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of AMG 232 in combination with trametinib and dabrafenib in subjects with metastatic melanoma followed by a direct comparison of AMG 232 combined with trametinib and dabrafenib versus trametinib combined with dabrafenib alone.

DRUG: AMG 232|DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Dabrafenib
Subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Results of safety laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, ECG measurements, PK parameters; Progression-free Survival Rate, Incidence and grade of treatment-emergent adverse events, including dose-limiting toxicities; AMG 232, trametinib, dabrafenib, and metabolite PK parameters; progression-free Survival, 36 months
Time to and duration of overall response and duration of stable disease measured by CT or MRI and assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Progression-free and Overall Survival, Objective Tumor Response, 36 months
The study will be conducted in 3 parts: Part 1 - Dose Escalation, Part 2 - Dose Expansion and Part 3, a randomized Phase 2a.

In both part 1 and 2, subjects will be enrolled open-label into 1 of 2 arms. For both Arm 1 and Arm 2, the part 1 dose escalation is aimed at determining an AMG 232 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with a fixed dose of the combination drug(s) and evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of each combination. Part 2 dose expansion will enroll subjects to receive therapy with a dose and schedule of AMG 232 selected from the corresponding part 1 dose escalation. In part 2 subjects will be enrolled to confirm safety and tolerability and to assess clinical activity prior to proceeding to Part 3, Phase 2a. In Phase 2a, Subjects will be randomized open-label in a 1:1 ratio to receive AMG 232 in combination with trametinib plus dabrafenib versus trametinib plus dabrafenib alone.

Only Part 1 of the study was enrolled and the study did not proceed into Phase 2.
