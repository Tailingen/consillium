Early Interventional Treatment for Cancer Pain
The purpose of the study is to evaluate how feasible and beneficial it is to refer patients with cancer pain to a doctor who specializes in pain management, including procedures to relieve pain, and whether this is helpful to patients with pain related to their cancer.
Cancer Pain
OTHER: Early Referral|OTHER: Pain Management Strategies
Feasibility - Pain Consultation, Feasibility will be measured by the percentage of patients that have an interventional pain consultation within 4 weeks, with a threshold for determining feasibility of at least 80% of participants., 4 Weeks|Feasibility - Interventional Pain Procedure Rate, Feasibility will be measured by the percentage of patients who ultimately receive at least one interventional pain procedure, with a threshold for determining feasibility of at least 50% of participants., 4 Months|Acceptability - Satisfaction Ratings, Acceptability will be measured by the percentage of patients satisfied with their interventional pain management care, with a threshold of at least 80% of patients rating the quality of care received at the interventional pain management clinic at a 7 or above on a 0-10 scale (adapted from HCAHPS; 0 being the worst clinic possible, 10 being the best clinic possible). For participants with missing data at 4-months, we imputed their responses at 2-months., 4 Months
This is a single arm pilot study evaluating a new system of referral and pain evaluation for patients with advanced solid tumors and moderate-to-severe pain who are not already on high-dose opioids to an anesthesia-trained interventional pain management specialist .

A variety of interventional treatments for pain have been proven effective for cancer patients. Often without early referral patients do not get evaluated for interventional procedures for their pain unless the pain is very severe, or they are admitted to the hospital. It is expect this intervention will work by providing effective pain treatments to patients sooner than they might normally be referred and will be evaluated by how many patients are candidates for interventional treatments for their pain, whether patients choose to receive these treatments, and whether patients find the pain specialist referral acceptable and helpful

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study interventions including evaluations and follow up visits, as well as surveys at the beginning, middle, and end of the study. Participants will be followed on the study for 4 months.

It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.
