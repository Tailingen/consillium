Olmutinib Trial in T790M (+) NSCLC Patients Detected by Liquid Biopsy Using BALF Extracellular Vesicular DNA
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Olmutinib(Olita®) in patients with T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confirmed using DNA extracted from extracellular vesicles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Olmutinib
Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission(CR) or partial remission(PR) based on RECIST version 1.1, Change from baseline at every 6 weeks until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 12 months
Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR, PR, and SD during the treatment cycles according to the RECIST version 1.1, Change from baseline at every 6 weeks until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from first administration of study drug to determination of tumor progression by RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Change from baseline at every 6 weeks until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 12 months
This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of Olmutinib(Olita®) administered to patients with T790M-positive NSCLC confirmed using DNA extracted from extracellular vesicles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as measured by objective response rate (ORR).
