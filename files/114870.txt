Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SABR) for Definitive Treatment of Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether SABR boost therapy is effective in women with locally advanced cervical cancer without increased risk of acute gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
RADIATION: SABR Boost Therapy
Time Taken to Induce Primary Tumor Control, The primary objective is to improve primary tumor local control of eligible LACC using SABR as the mechanism for delivering boost therapy to 85% at 2 years post treatment, 2 years
Patients enrolled in this study will receive 45 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions of intensity modulated external beam radiation therapy + weekly cisplatinum . Following the completion of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), patients will receive 28 Gy in 4 fractions using stereotactic body radiation therapy techniques.
