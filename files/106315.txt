Predictive Value of Postoperative Circulating Tumor DNA Monitoring for Colorectal Cancer Recurrence
This observational study aims to assess the predictive value of postoperative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring in evaluating the risk of recurrence in stage I-IV colorectal cancer patients. The study involves the collection of blood samples from patients who have undergone surgery for colorectal cancer. Sensitivity-enhanced molecular biology techniques are utilized to detect ctDNA in these samples. The correlation between ctDNA detection and the risk of recurrence is evaluated by analyzing patient follow-up data and clinical information. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of improved postoperative management strategies, such as identifying high-risk individuals and implementing additional treatment measures to reduce the risk of recurrence.
