Standard Follow-up Program Neuro-oncology Patients (SFP Neuro-Oncology)
Standardised evaluation of baseline data regarding tumor-, patient- and treatment-characteristics as well as follow-up data regarding tumor- and clinical-outcome of neuro-oncology patients treated with radical/curative radiotherapy.

Motive:

Currently there is limited data on dose-effect relationships of tissues and structures in and around the brain. This lack of knowledge hampers patient selection for proton therapy, technique innovations, and accurate prediction of treatment outcome.

Goal:

To evaluate the selection for radiation treatment, obtain more knowledge on dose-effect relationships and enable insight in necessary treatment technique innovations that would improve treatment outcome.
