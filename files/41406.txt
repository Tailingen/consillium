Clinical Outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer Using in Laparoscopic Gastrectomy With Lymph Node Dissection for Remnant Gastric Cancer
Patients with resectable remnant gastric cancer were selected as study subjects to investigate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of ICG near-infrared imaging tracing in guiding laparoscopic lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer by comparing injection ICG group and non-injection ICG group.

Indocyanine Green Tracer is often applied in surgery for gastric cancer. Its application in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer is at the stage of cases accumulation, method studying and clinical research. There is no prospective studies to identify the clinical outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer using in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer. On the basis of more than 300 cases of laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer, we want to apply the Indocyanine Green Tracer, a cheap, easy to operate and no radiation pollution way, to predict the positive lymph nodes in remnant gastric cancer, to guid the scope of laparoscopic lymph node dissection for remnant gastric cancer.
