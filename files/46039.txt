Combining PD-1 Blockade, CD137 Agonism and Adoptive Cell Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this Pilot Study is to investigate the safety, side effects, and benefits of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) when they are given with the drug nivolumab. Nivolumab is a type of immunotherapy - a drug that is used to boost the ability of the immune system to fight cancer, infection, and other diseases.

The primary endpoints of this pilot trial will be the safety and feasibility of the treatment regimens.
