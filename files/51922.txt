A Phase I Study of TAS-102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With Renal Impairment
Study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal impairment.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAS-102
PK parameters of FTD, FTY, and TPI in plasma after a single dose of TAS-102, FTD, FTY and TPI: pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. FTD, FTY, and TPI: Ae% and CLr. FTD and TPI: CL/F, Vd/F of TAS-102, Blood samples will be collected in Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 12 at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post AM dose of TAS-102|Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment
This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors with varying degrees of renal impairment. The study is conducted in 2 parts: the Pharmacokinetic Part (Cycle 1) and the Extension Part (Cycles 2 and beyond). Patients may continue to receive treatment with TAS-102 during the study extension part only after completion of the Pharmacokinetic Part.
