Study of CRX100 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This clinical study is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the drug product produced by Administering CRX100 alone and in combination with Pembrolizumab in advanced solid malignancies. Patients will be screened and evaluated to determine whether or not they meet stated inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable the ex vivo generation of CRX100. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma), gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and osteosarcoma.

The study will start with monotherapy dose escalation followed by combination cohorts.

Frequency of treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities, The Primary Outcome Measure will be based on the frequency of treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities during and after the administration of investigational drug in monotherapy and investigational drug with combination therapy., 28 days following dose administration for each dosed subject.|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximum feasible dose (MFD) or optimal biological dose (OBD) and determine recommended Phase 1b/Phase 2a dose level., Review of safety review committee following subject treatment to review any AEs, SAEs, or DLTs, 28 days following dose administration for each dosed subject.
Biodistribution of CRX100 based on subject's viral load as assessed through a viral shedding assay., To characterize the biodistribution of CRX100 based on each subject's viral load as assessed through a viral shedding assay, following a single dose of investigational product., 28 days following dose administration for each dosed subject.|Immune response to investigational drug based on subject's levels of neutralizing antibodies., Levels of neutralizing vvDD antibodies will be summarized by dose level and time point following a single dose of investigational product., 28 days following dose administration for each dosed subject.|Early anti-tumor activity of investigational drug based on iRECIST criteria, Summarized based on best response observed using RECIST classification of response. Overall response and frequencies of each level of response., 6 months after dose administration for each dosed subject.
