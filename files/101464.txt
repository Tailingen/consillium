Combining Tongue and Gastric Cancer Cascade With Artificial Intelligence
This study combines artificial intelligence with tongue images, by collating and collecting tongue images and diagnostic and pathological results of gastroscopic diseases, mining and analysing the correlation between tongue images and OLGA, OLGIM stages, Correa sequences and constructing prediction models, to deeply investigate the relationship between tongue images and precancerous diseases, precancerous lesions and gastric cancer.

Firstly, tongue pictures and patient information will be collected after the patient signed an informed consent form.

Secondly, after the patient undergoes gastroscopy, patient gastroscopy reports and pathology reports will be obtained.

Thirdly, the investigator will assess the patient's gastroscopy report for the Correa sequence of gastric cancer with OLGA and OLGIM staging.

Finally, the patient's tongue image, information and gastric cancer cascade response are matched to construct an artificial intelligence model and assess the quality of the model.
