Influence of Biopsy Technique on Moleculargenetic Tumor Characterisation in NSCLC
Study design Prospective multicentre explorative randomized single blinded study to evaluate accuracy of molecular genetic characterisation of NSCLC. Patients with suspected lung cancer are randomized in a 1:1-setting for bronchoscopic tumor tissue either by forceps or by cryobiopsy. Apart from the bronchoscopic techniques liquid biopsy of peripheral blood and if feasible transbronchial needle aspiration with or without endobronchial ultrasound guidance are performed for in all patients.

Objectives

Primary Objective:

assessment of differences in detection of molecular genetic alterations in NSCLC between bronchoscopic forceps biopsy and bronchoscopic cryobiopsy

Secondary Objective:

assessment of differences in detection of molecular genetic alterations in NSCLC between

* liquid biopsy, solid tumor tissue by bronchoscopic techniques, cytologic material by TBNA
* combination of methods (tissue biopsy, TBNA and liquid biopsy) and single techniques
* naïve and processed tumor tissue specimen (eg. microdissection)

To assess differences in side effects e.g. periinterventional bleeding

Explorative Objective:

To explore tumor mutational burden with regard to

* solid tumor tissue by bronchoscopic forceps biopsy by bronchoscopic cryobiopsy
* cytologic material by (EBUS-guided) TBNA
* liquid biopsy

Target subject population Patients with suspected lung cancer or proven NSCLC and visible tumor suspicious lesion(s) requiring tissue diagnosis form the study population of this trial.
