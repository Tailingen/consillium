Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography Screening for Lung Cancer in Survivors of Hodgkin's Disease
This research study is being done because patients with a history of chest radiation treatment for Hodgkin's disease have been shown to be at increased risk for developing lung cancer a number of years out from treatment. The risk appears to be further increased among patients with a smoking history. Currently, the practice is to recommend annual low-dose chest CT scans in survivors of Hodgkin's disease who have received prior chest radiation treatment and who have at least a moderate smoking history. In this study, the CT scans will be read and interpreted by the study radiologist, and the results recorded in a consistent manner.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: chest computed tomography scan
To Prospectively Collect Data on Chest CT Screening for Patients at Increase Lung-cancer Risk After Hodgkin's Disease., In this study, patients will under annual low-dose chest CT screening. The total number of lung cancer detected through the screening will be recorded, 3 years
- Participants will undergo a chest computed tomography (CT) scan once a year for a 3-year period.
