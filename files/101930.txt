Portal Vein Resection in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours
The limited evidence on the value of portal vein resection in patients with borderline resectable and/or locally advanced PanNENs is an incentive to carry out a retrospective multicentre study amongst centres with specific interest in the management of PanNENs and with experience on vascular reconstruction. Unlike previous studies on pancreatic cancer, it is more difficult to standardise the comparative parameters as the definition of borderline resectable disease has never been published for PanNENs. Similarly, different histological classifications make impossible to collect data exclusively on T3 tumours. Therefore, we aim to compare the short and long-term outcomes (including the impact of the histological depth of vascular invasion on survival) between patients undergoing standard PD and PD with portal vein resection for PanNENs, (regardless of T stage), by collecting and analysing retrospective data in this single centre study
