A Study Evaluating the Association of Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy and Durvalumab for Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
This study is a phase I/II, national, multicenter, open-label study starting with a Phase I part followed by a Phase II part.

The phase I part of the study aims to evaluate the safety of the association of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hFSRT) and the anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab immunotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. A maximum number of 12 patients will be enrolled in this phase I part.

Once the recommended combination schema will be declared, patients will be enrolled in the Phase II part of the study in order to evaluate the efficacy (overall survival) of the combined treatment in recurrent glioblastoma. In this Phase II part, 100 patients will be assigned by randomization to one of the two following arms:

* Arm A (control arm): Radiation therapy alone
* Arm B (Experimental arm): Combined treatment with Anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab
Glioblastoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy|DRUG: Durvalumab
Phase I: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) incidence, For each patient of the phase I part, DLT incidence will be evaluated until one month after the last radiotherapy fraction., 8 months|Phase II: overall survival, 36 months post randomization
Phase I and II: Intracranial progression-free interval, Intracranial progression-free interval is defined by the time from inclusion (for phase I) or randomization (for phase II) to local or distant (outside the re-irradiated volume) progression. Patients without progression at last follow-up news are censored at this date., 27 months|Phase I: Safety and tolerability according to the classification of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03, 19 months|Phase I and II: Quality of life using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ C30)., 27 months|Phase I and II : Quality of life using the using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brain Neoplasm (QLQ-BN20)., 27 months|Phase I and II: Neurologic and neurocognitive functions using Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale., 27 months|Phase I and II: Neurologic and neurocognitive functions using Neurologic Assessment in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests., 27 months|Phase II: Time to Quality of Life (QoL) deterioration., Time to QoL deterioration is defined as the time interval between randomization and first decrease in QoL score greater or equal to 5 points. Patients without such a QoL decrease will be censored at last follow-up news or at initiation of a new therapeutic strategy., 27 months|Phase II: time to neurocognitive deterioration, Time to neurocognitive deterioration is defined as the time interval between randomization and first of 3 points difference in MoCA as minimal clinically important difference. Patients without such a neurocognitive decrease will be censored at last follow-up news or at initiation of a new therapeutic strategy., 27 months|Phase II: Immune-related intracranial progression-free interval, Immune-related intracranial progression-free interval is defined by the time from randomization to local or distant (outside the re-irradiated volume) progression (based on immunotherapy Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology iRANO). Patients without progression at last follow-up news are censored at this date., 27 months|Phase II: Acute and late toxicities according to the classification of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03, 27 months
