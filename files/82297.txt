Alternative to Two-Stage Hepatectomy
Two-stage hepatectomy with or without portal vein embolization allows to treat multiple bilobar metastases expanding surgical indications for these patients. However, it has some related drawbacks: two operations are needed, and some patients do not complete the treatment strategy for disease progression. Using experience gained from our ultrasound guided resection policy we explored the safety and effectiveness of one-stage surgical procedures in patients otherwise recommended for the two-stage approach.
Colorectal Cancer|Liver Metastases
PROCEDURE: One-stage ultrasound guided hepatectomy
The primary outcome was the safety of the procedure. To this purpose we studied morbidity, mortality, amount of blood loss, rate of blood transfusions, and postoperative trend of liver function tests., 30-day and 90-day postoperatively
The secondary outcome measure was the reliability of the procedure from an oncological standpoint. For this purpose we studied the rate of true local recurrence (cut-edge) after a minimum follow-up of 6 months., Minimum Follow-up of 6 months
