Lenvatinib targets VEGFR1, 2, and 3, PDGFRÎ±, Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and the KIT and RET tyrosine kinases and was initially developed for use in various tumor types. This is a single-center, non-random, open-label study in participants with unresectable BTC and disease progression or failure following at least one chemotherapy regimen. This study contains three procedures: a pre-treatment procedure that will last within 21 days; a treatment procedure that will consist of study treatment cycles and tumor assessment conducted every 6-8 weeks; and a follow-up procedure that will begin immediately after the off-treatment visit and will continue as long as the participant is alive, unless the participant withdraws consent, or until the terminal of the study.
