Dose Escalation Followed by Study of RAD001 in Combination With Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of RAD001 and the highest dose of this drug that can be given to people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer safely in combination with trastuzumab. RAD001 has been used in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, in recipients of solid-organ transplants, healthy volunteers and experiments with animals, and information from those other research studies suggest that this RAD001 may help to stop cancer cells from growing abnormally.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached. Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were defined as follows (CTCAE v4.0):

* Any grade 4 hematologic toxicity, excluding anemia.
* Any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, except for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or hyperlipidemia that responds promptly (within 24 hours for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and within 1 week for hyperlipidemia) to appropriate treatment, and except for cardiac toxicity which will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment.
* Need to hold \>1 dose of trastuzumab or \> 7 doses of RAD001 within the first 3 weeks because of the presence of toxicity., Cycle One (first 21 days of treatment)
Clinical Response Rate, Best response on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria with overall clinical response defined as achieving stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response. SD is neither CR/PR or progressive disease (PD). PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, takings as reference smallest sum LD since treatment started., Disease assessments occurred every 9 weeks (3 cycles) on treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Median duration of treatment was 2.4 months.
* Since we are looking for the dose of RAD001 that can be given safely in combination with trastuzumab, not everyone will receive the same amount of RAD001. Small groups of participants will be enrolled at a certain dose of RAD001 and if they tolerate the medications well, the next small group will receive a higher dose. This will continue until the optimal dose of RAD001 that can be given in combination with trastuzumab is found.
* Blood will be drawn on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of the first cycle of treatment and then once at every 4 cycles for everolimus pharmacokinetics analysis.
* There is an optional tissue biopsy component to this study asking for 2 biopsies performed pre-treatment and after the cycle one.
* We will keep track of the participants medical condition for the next three years by calling them on the telephone twice a year to see how they are doing.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

- To assess the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination with trastuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer

Secondary

* To evaluate the activity of RAD001 plus trastuzumab, as defined by objective response rate, in patients with progression on a trastuzumab-containing regimen
* To evaluate changes in signaling molecules in response to trastuzumab and RAD001 in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 in combination with trastuzumab.

STATISTICAL DESIGN:

This Phase I study followed a standard 3+3 dose escalation design with two dose levels of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab to be evaluated. The DLT observation period was cycle one (first 21 days of treatment). There is a 20 patient expansion cohort treated at the MTD. The regimen would be considered promising if at least 2 objective responses are observed out of 20 treated patients. If the true but unknown response rate is 15% then the probability of observing at least 2 responses is 82% but if the true rate is 5% this probability reduces to 26%.
