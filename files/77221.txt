Study of Tretinoin Capsules in Combination With Azacitidine and Venetoclax in Treatment Naïve Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study was a prospective, two-arm, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tretinoin capsules combined with azacitidine and venetoclax in the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Azacitidine, venetoclax, and tretinoin may arrest cancer cell growth by demethylation, promoting cell differentiation, or killing cells, while reducing blood-related adverse effects by promoting cell differentiation.

DRUG: ATRA+Venetoclax+Azacitidine|DRUG: Chemotherapy drug
The overall response rate (ORR) after the second therapy, ORR rate was defifined as patients achieving a CRc or PR, Efficacy was assessed within 2 weeks after completion of the second course of therapy or within 1 week before the third course of therapy|The composite complete remission rate (CRc) after the second therapy, complete response (CR) plus complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)\] after 2 cycles of treatment., Efficacy was assessed within 2 weeks after completion of the second course of therapy or within 1 week before the third course of therapy
Composite complete response (CRc) after the first therapy, CRc rate was defifined as patients achieving a CR or CRi, Efficacy was assessed within 2 weeks after completion of the first course of induction therapy or within 1 week before the second course of therapy|The overall response rate (ORR) after the first therapy, ORR rate was defifined as patients achieving a CRc or PR, Efficacy was assessed within 2 weeks after completion of the first course of induction therapy or within 1 week before the second course of therapy|Rate of transfusion independence, Rate of transfusion independence (TI) , including platelet transfusion independence rate and red blood cell transfusion independence rate., Up to 28 days after the start of therapy|Overall Survival (OS), (OS) refers to the length of time from randomization until the death of the patient from any cause., up to 2 years after the date of the last enrolled participants
This is a multi-center, non-controlled, open-label, Phase 3 interventional study.Young (≥18 and ≤60 years old) patients with newly diagnosed non M3, acute myeloid leukemia will receive a combination of AZA+Venetoclax+ATRA(AVA regimen) or daunorubicin +cytarabine(DA regimen) as induction treatment for 2 cycles.

According to standard procedures, patients will receive one of the following consolidation regimens separately, including the AVA regimen, or medium-dose cytarabine alone or in combination with anthracyclines regimen for 2cycle. After consolidation therapy, maintenance treatment could be given once a month for 4 times, then once every 3 months until progression.

After the second induction therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was recommended for patients with suitable donors.

The primary endpoint is ORR after second induction therapy.Outcome measures included complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) .
