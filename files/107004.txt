Comparison of Record in VERITON Camera to the Anger Camera Procedure in Patients Treated by 131-iodine
The aim of this study is to show that the SPECT/CT whole body recording procedure lasting less than or equal to 30 minutes in a VERITON-CT™ camera, can be substituted for the classic procedure, giving at least equivalent information in searches for primary or metastatic neoplastic lesions.

Patients with thyroid cancer treated with iodine 131 will receive an iodine 131 activity of between 1100 and 3700 MBq delivered as a capsule orally to eliminate the remaining thyroid tissue. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is then started to correct the hypothyroidism.

3 days later, a 2D whole body recording will be associated with complementary Single Photonic Emission Computed Tomography CT scans (SPECT/CT). It enables visualising the fixation of iodine 131, provides information on the thyroid remnants left in place during surgical thyroidectomy and to carry out an extension assessment by visualizing the possible presence of metastases fixing iodine at the level of the regional lymph nodes or many distant sites, in particular, lung and bone.

In VERICATH study, the hypothesis is that this classic procedure could be advantageously replaced by a single full-body SPECT/CT recording of a limited duration (≤ 30 minutes), obtained with a camera state-of-the-art semiconductor device called the VERITON-CT™ (Spectrum Dynamics Medical) camera.
