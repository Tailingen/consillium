Phase II Study Of E7389, Halichondrin B Analogue, In Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC, Who Progressed During Or After Platinum-Based Doublet Chemotherapy
This is a study of E7389 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who progressed during or after treatment with a platinum agent and another chemotherapy.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: E7389 28 Day Cycle|DRUG: E7389 21 Day Cycle
Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR), Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), consisting of complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR). Defined as the best response from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence. Lesions measured by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objective response rate: complete response (CR-disappearance of all lesions)+ partial response (PR-30% decrease in lesion diameter), Progressive Disease (PD-20% increase in lesion diameter), stable disease (SD-neither shrinkage nor increase of lesions)., From start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence
Duration of Response, Measured from the time that measurement criteria were met for complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) until the first date that recurrence or progressive disease was objectively documented., From time of CR or PR until recurrence or progressive disease|Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from the start of study medication until progressive disease or death from any cause during the study period., From start of study medication until progressive disease or death|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from the start of study medication until death from any cause., From time of start of study medication until death
