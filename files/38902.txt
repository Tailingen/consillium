Mediterranean Diet Intervention in Adolescents With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The aim of the present randomized controlled study was to examine wether a clinical decision support stystem would increase the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) of adolescent girls, aged 15-17 years, diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The intervention lasted for 3 months and in total, 40 girls were randomly assigned to either the MD group (n=20) or a Control group receiving general nutritional advice (n=20). Anthropometry, nutritional intake, psychological well-being, and blood markers were analyzed at the begninning and the end of the trial.

Adherance to the Mediterranean diet, Adherance was assessed with the Kidmed score, 3 months
Improvement of psychological well-being, Psychological well-being was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS), 3 months
The aim of the present randomised controlled trial was to investigate the effects of a Mediterranean Diet (MD) intervention delivered through a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) on various dietary, health parameters and anxiety in adolescent females, aged 15-17 years, with PCOS. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 40 adolescent females diagnosed with PCOS, randomly assigned to either an Intervention group (IG) (n=20) or a Control group (CG) (n=20). The IG received personalized dietary guidance based on the MD principles, delivered through a CDSS, while the CG received general nutritional advice. Measurements of dietary intake, anthropometric indices, biochemical markers, and psychological well-being were collected at baseline and after a 3-month intervention period. After 3 months, significant improvements were observed in the IG compared to the CG. Adherence to the MD increased significantly in the IG, leading to decreased caloric intake, fat, saturated fatty acids, and dietary cholesterol, and increased intake of monounsaturated fatty acids. Conversely, the CG experienced an increase in fat and dietary cholesterol intake. Both groups exhibited an increase in fiber intake, with a more pronounced rise observed in the MD group. Psychological well-being showed a significant reduction in anxiety levels in the IG group, while no significant change was observed in the CG. The intervention led to improvements in dietary patterns, body composition, and psychological well-being. These results underscore the importance of dietary interventions tailored to the MD principles in the management of PCOS among adolescent females.
