Application of PLDR External Irradiation Combined With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Recurrent Cervical Cancer
At present, the treatment methods for recurrent cervical cancer are very limited. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs) is a promising new directions for recurrent cervical cancer, but the clinical response rate is insufficient. Pulse low-dose rate radiotherapy (PLDR) is a new technology in recent years, which uses continuous pulse low-dose rate irradiation to induce hypersensitivity in tumors, and its clinical safety has been verified. Compared to conventional radiotherapy, PLDR has advantages in protecting the lymphatic system and relieving the immune barrier, but it is still unclear whether it can improve the efficacy of ICB. This project aims to combine PLDR with ICB to explore new strategies for recurrent cervical cancer.
