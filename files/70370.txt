The Role of Erlotinib an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Inhibitor in the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, Erlotinib has on Myelodysplastic syndrome. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of blood diseases where the bone marrow (spongy space in long bones which is the factory for blood cell production) does not make enough blood cells and therefore there is a lack of healthy blood cells in the body. This can result in anemia, risk for infection and/or bleeding..
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Erlotinib
First 20 patients will be evaluated for overall response rate (CR, PR or HI)., Estimated to be about 1 year.
If the first analysis of 20 patients warrant further enrollment, an additional 15 eligible patients will be registered. If 8 or more of the 35 patients achieve CR, PR or HI, then Phase III study will be warranted., Estimated to be about 1 year.
MDS is a neoplastic clonal stem disorder characterized by bone marrow failure with cytopenia, dyslastic morphological features and tendency to progress to acute myeloid leukemia. It is estimated that MDS is the most common hematological malignancy in the USA. Several treatment options are available for MDS ranging from supportive care, growth factor use, chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and newer novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and hypomethylating agents. Each of the different available treatments for MDS work in certain subset and relatively small percentage of patients, keeping the door open for novel therapeutic strategies to be explored. The NIH has published requests for applications on myeloproliferative and myelopdysplastic syndrome emphasizing the need for more research in this area.
