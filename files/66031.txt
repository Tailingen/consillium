Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Stomach, Gastroesophageal, or Esophageal Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with advanced stomach, gastroesophageal, or esophageal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
Stomach Neoplasms|Esophageal Neoplasms
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Fluorouracil
Number of Participants With an Objective Response, * Objective response (defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria)
* CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 months)
Progression Free Survival, Duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Through 1 year after completion of treatment (median follow-up 16.2 months - 95% CI 4.7-42.5 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), Duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is defined as At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., Through 1 year after completion of treatment (median follow-up 16.2 months - 95% CI 4.7-42.5 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause., Through 1 year after completion of treatment (median follow-up 16.2 months - 95% CI 4.7-42.5 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate, * Clinical benefit rate is the percentage of combined patients who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD)
* CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm
* PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters
* SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 months)|Duration of Response, Time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, Through 1 year after completion of treatment (median follow-up 16.2 months - 95% CI 4.7-42.5 months)|Toxicity and Tolerability (Arm A and Arm B) as Measured by the Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events, 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 months)
