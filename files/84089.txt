ITIL-306 in Advanced Solid Tumors
ITIL-306-201 is a phase 1a/1b, multicenter, clinical trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of ITIL-306 in adult participants with advanced solid tumors whose disease has progressed after standard therapy. ITIL-306 is a cell therapy derived from a participant's own tumor-infiltrating immune cells (lymphocytes; TILs) and contains a unique molecule designed to increase TIL activity when it encounters folate receptor α (FOLR1) on the tumor.
