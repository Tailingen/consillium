Cabazitaxel - PF Induction Chemotherapy
The primary objective of this study is to determine the first-cycle maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose of Cabazitaxel when combined with Cisplatin and Follow-Up induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for three cycles.

DRUG: Cabazitaxel 10mg/m2|DRUG: Cabazitaxel 12.5mg/m2|DRUG: Cabazitaxel 15mg/m2|DRUG: Cabazitaxel 17.5mg/m2|DRUG: Cabazitaxel 20mg/m2
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT. The study will be conducted until MTD and recommended Phase II dose are established., at 1 week|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT. The study will be conducted until MTD and recommended Phase II dose are established., at 4 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT. The study will be conducted until MTD and recommended Phase II dose are established., at 7 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT. The study will be conducted until MTD and recommended Phase II dose are established., at 9 weeks|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as a grade3 toxicity lasting more than 7 days or grade 4 or 5 toxicity, with the exception of febrile neutropenia which will be considered as ½ DLT per full dose per episode. The DLT will be the basis for determining the MTD. Treatment cohorts will be dosed in escalating order only after the safety of the previous dose level is established, or until an MTD has been determined., at 1 week|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as a grade3 toxicity lasting more than 7 days or grade 4 or 5 toxicity, with the exception of febrile neutropenia which will be considered as ½ DLT per full dose per episode.

Toxicity Profile, The toxicity profile of cabazitaxel when combined with cisplatin and FU induction chemotherapy will be assessed, at 9 weeks|Overall Response Rate, The Best Overall Response Rate (complete and partial responses) will be assessed after completion of 3 cycles of treatment., at 9 weeks|Progression Free Survival/Overall Survival, The Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival will be assessed during the 3-year follow-up period. The follow-up period is every 3 months for the first 2 years post consolidation (week 16) thereafter every 6 months for the 3rd year post consolidation (week 16)., for 3 years
The primary study objectives are the following:

* To assess the safety, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicity of cabazitaxel when combined with cisplatin and Follow-Up (FU) induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
* To establish the phase II recommended dose of cabazitaxel when combined with cisplatin and Follow-Up induction in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

The secondary study objectives, in regards to the combined Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil regimen in patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, are the following:

* To assess the toxicity profile
* To assess best Overall Response Rate (complete and partial responses) after completion of 3 cycles of treatment
* To assess Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) after 3 years Analysis of the secondary variables will be primarily descriptive in nature due to the small sample size. All results will be considered hypothesis generating to be confirmed in a future study.

Patient, for whom an informed consent has been obtained and who have met the inclusion/exclusion criteria after having the screening evaluation performed within a one-week window, will be assigned to a dose level according to the dose escalation rule described in the protocol. Treatment consists of an Induction chemotherapy period, which is the period when the patient will undergo 3 cycles of Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil (PF). The Induction chemotherapy will be followed by Consolidation Therapy, which is 6-7 weeks of Chemoradiation treatment or Surgery + Recovery time, depending on their primary site and overall medical condition. Both treatment periods will consist of approximately 16 weeks (9 weeks of Induction and 7 weeks of Consolidation, if Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy (CRT)), or shorter than 16 weeks, if surgery. After three cycles, the patients will be assessed for clinical, radiographic, and pathologic response to Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil before beginning Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy or surgery. Patients, who do not complete three cycles of Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil for reasons of toxicity, progressive disease, choice, or other medical necessity, will be treated with standard Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy or surgery depending on their primary site and overall medical condition. Once the Consolidation treatment is completed, the follow-up of patients will be for 3 years.
