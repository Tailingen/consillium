Defining PET / CT Protocols With Optimized F18-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) Dose, Focusing on Reduced Radiation Dose and Improved Image Quality
Identify the best combination of predictive variables that influence ionizing radiation dose and improved image quality through analysis and quantification of PET-CT images in simulators and patients.

OTHER: Image quantify
Correlation of body weight with the variation coefficient (image noise)., The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be kilograms (kg) for body weight, and percentage for the variation coefficient., 360 seconds
Correlation of dose-regimen with the variation coefficient (image noise)., The dose-regimen will be calculated based on radiation dose and body surface. The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be MegaBecquerel per kilogram (MBq/kg) for dose-regimen, and percentage for the variation coefficient., 360 seconds|Correlation of acquisition protocol time with the variation coefficient (image noise)., Images will be acquired every 30 seconds until a maximum of 360 seconds. The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be seconds for the acquisition time, and percentage for the variation coefficient., 360 seconds
