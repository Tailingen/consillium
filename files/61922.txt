4 Courses vs 2 Courses of Pembrolizumab Combined With Carboplatin and Albumin-binding Paclitaxel of Neoadjuvant Therapy in HNSCC
In this study, 200 patients with resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (T3 or T4, N0) were enrolled and preoperatively combined with pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor), carboplatin, and albumin-binding paclitaxel. The subjects were randomly divided 1:1 into four treatments and two treatments. The imaging and pathological changes of tumor and paracancer tissues before and after treatment were observed. Clinical information, such as pathological grade, stage, treatment, prognosis, serology, imaging, etc., was collected to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4-course pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel compared with 2-course neoadjuvant therapy for resectable oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This is a prospective, one-arm, phase II clinical study.

Main purpose By calculating pathological complete response (pCR) in the experimental group, we evaluated the efficacy (optimality) of four courses of pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel compared with two courses of neoadjuvant therapy for resectable oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T3 or T4, N0).

At the same time, this study evaluated the safety of medication, specifically: The severity of adverse events associated with neoadjuvant therapy will be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) during this study and during follow-up, and the occurrence of adverse events in the experimental and control groups will be compared. To evaluate the safety of 4-course Pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel compared with 2-course neoadjuvant therapy for resectable oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T3 or T4, N0).

Secondary Purpose

1. The event-free survival (EFS) of the two groups were compared;
2. The main pathological response rate (MPR) of the two groups were compared;
3. pTR of the two groups was compared;
4. Overall survival (OS) of the two groups was compared;
5. The radiological responses of the two groups were compared;
6. The operation delay rate of the two groups was compared; Exploratory purpose For the response of enrolled patients after treatment, group treatment was conducted according to the guidelines, and stratified factors influencing the prognosis and treatment plan of immunotherapy were explored according to stratification. The stratification factors taken into consideration are: P16 status, smoking history, TNM stage, tumor reduction (MPR condition), presence of risk factors (according to the guidelines, risk factors are presence of episopercular invasion, positive incisal margin, proximal incisal margin, pT3 or pT4, pN2 or pN3 lymph nodes located in the IV and V regions of the neck, Nerve invasion, vascular invasion, etc.). The purpose of this study was to stratified risk factors for evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy for resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. At the same time, hematological, pathological and fecal indicators collected in the design of the experiment were collected. Correlation analysis was conducted to statistically analyze the relationship between these indicators and the therapeutic effect of the program.
