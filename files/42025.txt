A Phase I/II Study of Cisplatin and Radiation in Combination With Sorafenib in Cervical Cancer
This will be a multi-institution, single-arm, open-label, phase I/II trial. Eligible patients will have pathologically-proven T1b-3b, N0/1, M0 epithelial carcinoma of the cervix. We hypothesize that sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have anti-tumor activity in patients with cervical cancer. Sorafenib has not previously been combined with conventional RT-CT to treat cervix cancer.
Cancer of the Cervix
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Radiation
Determine the biologic activity of sorafenib in cervix cancer., Not Determined
Determine the acute and late toxicity, and effect of sorafenib in combination with radiation and chemotherapy on the disease-free survival of patients with high-risk cervix cancer., Not Determined
During the phase I component of the study, low risk patients (tumor size â‰¤5 cm and radiographically node negative) will receive sorafenib alone in escalating doses for at least 1 week prior to the start of conventional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT-CT). High risk patients (tumor \> 5 cm or node positive) will receive sorafenib alone in escalating dose for at least 1 week prior to the start of RT-CT, as well as concurrently with RT-CT. Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level are planned. If 1/3 patients encounters a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If \>2/3 of patients encounter a DLT, then that dose level will be declared as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional 3 patients will be entered into the dose level one below the MTD. The recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as the dose level with \< 1/6 patients with DLT.

For the phase II component, all patients will receive sorafenib at the RPTD for at least 1 week prior to, and concurrent with, RT-CT.
