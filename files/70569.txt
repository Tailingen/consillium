Predictive Value of Analysing Tissue From Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer for Drug Sensitivity
It will be investigated whether it is possible to predict the effect or lack of effect of first-line treatment by analysing cancer cells from the individual patient receiving standard first line treatment. Also, the feasibility of selecting second-line therapy based on pre-treatment biopsies will be investigated.

Cells from pancreatic cancer will be grown in the laboratory to form small, circulating tumors and adjacent tissue, so called tumoroids. The tumoroids will then be exposed to different pre-specified anticancer drugs to hopefully reveal sensitivity or lack of sensitivity in the specific patient.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Inditreat|DRUG: Experimental drug
Predictive value of in-vitro testing, Predictive value is defined as the ability to correctly predict response or resistance to first-line chemotherapy, 2 months
Feasibility of selecting second-line therapy based on pre-treatment biopsies as measured by treatment response (RESIST 1.1 criteria), Every 2 months during treatment up to 180 days|Feasibility of selecting second-line therapy based on pre-treatment biopsies as measured by progression free survival (PFS), Every 2 months up to 12 months
