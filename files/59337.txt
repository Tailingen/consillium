Asian Investigation of Lanreotide Autogel® in the Management of GEP-NETs
Lanreotide Autogel® has been established as a standard of care for patients with locally advanced or metastatic GEP-NETs based on the success of CLARINET trial. However, only few patients with Asian ethnicity were included in the trial.

According to the nationwide comprehensive study of patients with GEP-NET in Korea, hindgut primary NETs(Rectal) occured more frequently than western countries. However, small intestine or lung primary NET is relatively rare compared with western countries.1) Considering the clinical characteristics of GEP-NETs are distinct between the patients in Asian and Western countries, further evaluation on the efficacy and safety of Lanreotide Autogel® in Asian patients with GEP-NETs is needed.
