Study of Pemetrexed+Platinum Chemotherapy With or Without Cosibelimab in First Line Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC
This is an efficacy and safety study of cosibelimab (CK-301) combined with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cosibelimab combined with pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin).

The primary hypothesis is that cosibelimab in combination with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone.
Metastatic Non-squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cosibelimab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Folic acid 350-1000 μg|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin B12 1000 μg|DRUG: Dexamethasone 4mg
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Approximately 3 years.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization until disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Approximately 3 years.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response or partial response per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 3 years.|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the earliest date of documented response until earliest date of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Approximately 3 years.|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study drug., Approximately 2 years.
CK-301-301 is a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of IV administered cosibelimab 1200 mg Q3W in combination with platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in subjects with NSCLC who have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease and in whom epidermal growth factor receptor-directed therapy or anaplastic lymphoma kinase-directed therapy was not indicated. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive cosibelimab 1200 mg in combination with pemetrexed and platinum therapy, or pemetrexed and platinum therapy alone. Subjects were stratified by smoking status (never versus former/current), cisplatin vs carboplatin, and PD-L1 status (Tumor Proportion Score \[TPS\] \< 1% vs 1-49% vs ≥ 50%) prior to randomization. Subjects with unevaluable PD-L1 status were included with the TPS \< 1% group.
