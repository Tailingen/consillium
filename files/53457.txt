Leading Healthy Eating and Activity Promotion Program
The goal of the LEAP project is to improve the health and well-being of cancer survivors and their co-survivors living in persistent poverty areas by providing healthy behavior change support. This will be done by engaging the community in adapting beneficial approaches for promoting healthy diet and regular physical activity into a program for cancer survivors and co-survivors that is appropriate for the persistent poverty context and social determinants of health.
