Genomic Predictors of Papillary Microcarcinoma Disease Progression
The study is being done to answer the following question: What are the specific clinical and molecular features that will help us predict which small thyroid cancers are likely to grow and be problematic?

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical and molecular characteristics that are predictive of tumor progression in small thyroid cancers.
Papillary Microcarcinoma
estimate the disease progression rate, Therefore, in order to ensure that we will have at least 459 patients with PTC being followed with active surveillance, we plan to enroll 500 total patients, of which 350 will have FNA diagnostic for PTC (of which 99% are expected to have PTC) and 150 patients will have FNA suspicious for PTC (of which 113 would be expected to have PTC). This sample size will enable us to estimate the 5 year disease progression rate requiring intervention to within Â±4% at 95% confidence level (using binomial calculation under the assumption that the study is not stopped early and the progression rate is not higher than 10%)., 4 years
