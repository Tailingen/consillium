Cordotomy in Reducing Pain in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This trial studies how well cordotomy works in reducing pain in patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). Cordotomy is performed on the spinal cord with a needle and guided by computed tomography scans and is designed to help reduce pain. This study is being done to learn if a cordotomy reduces pain in patients with unmanageable cancer pain.
Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Cordotomy|DRUG: Morphine|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|PROCEDURE: Sham Intervention
Reduction in pain intensity, Will be measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS)., Up to 6 months
Brief Pain Inventory pain interference items, Will provide initial estimates of the magnitude of the effect of cordotomy., Up to 6 months|Other ESAS symptoms, Will provide initial estimates of the magnitude of the effect of cordotomy., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the efficacy of cordotomy for patients with unilateral advanced cancer pain.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Define the patient experience of cordotomy for cancer pain refractory to palliative care.

II. Determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as a noninvasive biomarker for a successful cordotomy.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Patients undergo a cordotomy over 1-2 hours.

GROUP II: Patients receive morphine via injection into the spine and undergo a fake cordotomy over 1-2 hours.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and once every month for up to 6 months.
