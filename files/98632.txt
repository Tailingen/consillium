Phase II High Risk Prostate Cancer Trial Using Gene & Androgen Deprivation Therapies, Radiotherapy, & Surgery
This is a prospective phase II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk+ valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and prostatectomy in previously untreated high-risk prostate cancer.

This phase II study plans to assess efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk+ valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and prostatectomy in previously untreated high-risk prostate cancer patients.

Clinical response as evaluated by changes in serum PSA level and digital rectal examination as well as by histological alterations on re-biopsy and prostatectomy such as the presence of apoptosis, necrosis, tumor proliferation and immunologic response, will be assessed following HSV-tk + valacyclovir treatment. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores (See Appendices). Additionally, patients will be followed closely to assess nadir PSA, freedom from PSA-progression, and freedom from local and distant progression and overall survival.
