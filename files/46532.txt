JAB-3068 Activity in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JAB-3068 administered in investigational regimens in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: JAB-3068|DRUG: PD1 inhibitor
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) . A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first treatment cycle with JAB-3068 and JS001., 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (CR+PR)., 24 months
