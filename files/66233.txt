US Post-Marketing Safety Study of Moxetumomab Pasudotox-tdfk (LUMOXITI)
This study is being conducted to satisfy a post-marketing requirement (PMR) to provide evidence characterizing 1) the safety of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk in patients who are 65 years of age and older and/or 2) the safety of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk in patients who have moderate renal impairment defined as an estimated GFR of 30-59 ml/min
Hairy Cell Leukemia
Incident proportion of capillary leak syndrome, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of hemolytic uremic syndrome, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of renal toxicity, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of infusion related reactions, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of electrolyte and biochemical abnormalities, Electrolyte and biochemical abnormalities are defined as laboratory measurements of interest that exceed local laboratory standards, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of other medical events related to moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk interruption or discontinuation, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.|Incident proportion of other serious medical events that are life-threatening, resulting in hospitalizations and/or death, From day 1 of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk initiation up to 30 days after last dose of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.
The pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 1053) supported full approval of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a PNA, on 13 September 2018. Since HCL is a rare disease, clinical research has limited information concerning the safety of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk in elderly patient populations and patients with moderate renal impairment.This study is being conducted to satisfy a post-marketing requirement (PMR) to provide evidence characterizing the safety of moxetumomab in these patients.
