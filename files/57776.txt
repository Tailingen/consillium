A Study Comparing Abemaciclib Plus Temozolomide to Temozolomide Monotherapy in Children and Young Adults With High-grade Glioma Following Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to measure the benefit of adding abemaciclib to the chemotherapy, temozolomide, for newly diagnosed high-grade glioma following radiotherapy.

Your participation could last approximately 11 months and possibly longer depending upon how you and your tumor respond.
