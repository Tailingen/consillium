Open-Label, Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Duration of Severe Neutropenia After Same-Day Dosing of Eflapegrastim in Patients With Breast-Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Eflapegrastim on duration of neutropenia in patients with early-stage breast cancer when administered at varying intervals following Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide administration.

Time to Recovery of Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) From Nadir to ≥1.5×10^9/L in Cycle 1, Time to ANC Recovery is defined as the time from chemotherapy administration until the patient's ANC increases to ≥1.5×10\^9/liter (L) after the expected nadir., Cycle 1 is 21 days

This is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, actively-controlled study to evaluate the same day dosing of Eflapegrastim on duration of neutropenia when administered at varying intervals following Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer.

The study will be conducted in two phases: Early Phase and Expansion Phase.

1. In the Early Phase, approximately 45 patients were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 dosing time schedule arms. Each cycle was of 21 days. Total 4 cycles were evaluated for this phase. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, patients received Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy followed by administration of Eflapegrastim at 1 of 3-time schedules post-TC (30 minutes \[mins\], 3 hours or 5 hours). During Cycles 2-4, patients received Eflapegrastim 24 hours after TC administration (on Day 2).
2. In the Expansion Phase, additional 45 patients will be enrolled in Cycles 1-4, who will receive fixed dose of Eflapegrastim 30 mins after TC administration (on Day 1).

Safety evaluations will be conducted once the first 3 patients (for Early Phase) and the first 6 patients (for Expansion Phase) have completed Cycle 1 to determine if it is safe for patients to continue in that particular treatment arm.
