Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer
Current therapies for Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer provide very limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.
Stage IV Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory Stage IV Prostate Cancer.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
