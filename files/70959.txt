Number of Patients Reported With Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) That Were Causally Related to Treatment Administration by Maximum Grade., The assessed AEs were ASCI-related grade 3/4 adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the treatment., Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-administration period.|Number of Patients Reported With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Events which were part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) were captured as part of the clinical activity outcome variables in this study; therefore these did not need to be reported as SAEs. Progression/recurrence of the tumor in a patient was recorded as part of the clinical assessment data collection, and deaths due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form, but not as an SAE. However, if the investigator considered that there was a causal relationship between treatment or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression/recurrence, then the event was reported as an SAE. Any new primary cancer (non-related to the cancer under study) was reported as an SAE., During the entire study period, up to 5 years|Number of Seroconverted Patients for Melanoma Antigen (Anti-MAGE-A3), Seroconversion was defined as a concentration of antibodies assessed that was greater than the cut-off value for a patient whose concentration of such antibodies was below the cut-off level before the initiation of treatment. Seroconverted patients were those patients with anti-MAGE-A3 antibody concentrations ≥ 27., Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).|Anti-MAGE-A3 Antibody Concentrations, Anti-MAGE-A3 antibody concentrations were presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMTs) and expressed in ELISA units per millilitre (EL.U/mL), Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).|Number of Patients With Treatment Response for Anti-MAGE-A3 Antibodies, Treatment response defined as: For initially seronegative patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 27 EL.U/mL For initially seropositive patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 2 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration, Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).|Concentrations of Antibodies Against Protein D (Anti-PD), Anti-PD antibody concentrations were presented ad geometric mean concentrations (GMTs) and expressed in ELISA units per millilitre (EL.U/mL)., Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).|Number of Patients With Treatment Response for Anti-PD, Treatment response defined as: For initially seronegative patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 100 EL.U/mL For initially seropositive patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 2 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration, Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).|Anti-MAGE-A3 Antibody Concentrations (CMI), Analysis of MAGE-A3 cellular response was not performed and data were not collected.., Post Dose 4 at Week 13 (W13).
Number of Patients With Objective Tumor Response (OR) to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment, Response assessment was done based on a set of measurable lesions (MLs) identified at baseline as target lesions (TLs), and followed up until disease progression. Up to 5 MLs per organ \& 10 in total were identified as TLs and measured at baseline, selected based on size (those with the longest diameter \[LD\]) and measurability; a sum of LDs for all TLs was calculated and reported as baseline sum LD, which was used to characterize objective tumor response (OR), OR being defined as either complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) post MAGE-A3 ASCI treatment. After identification, MLs and TLs were assessed as regards CR and PR definitions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: CR = Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Number of Patients With Stable Disease (SD) Response to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment, Assessment was done based on a set of MLs identified at baseline as TLs and NTLs followed up until disease progression. TLs and NTLs were assessed as regards matching or not SD-related definitions, 1) SD definitions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for TLs \>= 20 mm and TLs both \>= and \< 20 mm: a) for TLs: SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as references the smallest sum LD since treatment start. and b) for NTLs: SD = Persistence of one or more NTL; 2) following below criteria for TLs \< 20mm e. a. a) for TLs: PR/SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR nor sufficient increase, to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since treatment start, and b) for NTLs: PR/SD = Persistence of one or more NTL., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Duration of Stable Disease (SD) Response to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment, Assessment was done based on a set of MLs identified at baseline as TLs and NTLs followed up until disease progression. Stable disease was defined as follows: 1) In case of target lesions (TL) greater than or equal to (≥) 20 mm: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as references the sum of Longest Diameter (LD) of TL recorded previously but not necessarily at baseline; 2) In case of TL both less than 20 mm and ≥ 20 mm: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as references the smallest sum LD since the start of the treatment. The minimal time interval required between 2 measurements for determination of SD was at least 12 weeks., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Number of Patients With Mixed Response (MxR) to MAGE-A3 ASCI Study Treatment, Assessment was done based on a set of MLs identified at baseline as TLs and NTLs followed up until disease progression. MLs were assessed as regards matching below MxR definitions. In case of evaluability per RECIST: a) MxR Type 1= at least (a.l.) 30% decrease in LD in a.l. one TL measured at baseline. Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2: appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL, and = SD/PR with new lesion. In case of non-evaluability per RECIST: a) MxR Type 1 = a clear decrease in diameters occurring in a.l. one TL measured at baseline. Such response occurring in SD/PD status of LD of (baseline) TL and without appearance of one or more new lesions = SD/PD with TL regression; b) MxR Type 2 = appearance of one or more new lesions occurring in SD/PR status of LD of TL = SD/PR with new lesion., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), by Gene Signature, TTF was defined as withdrawal from treatment with the MAGE-A3 ASCI study product due to disease progression or death. TTF analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) for the Overall Population, PFS was defined and calculated as the time from first treatment to either the first progression of the disease or the date of death, whichever occurred first. In case a patient went off protocol treatment, the date of first documented progression (if applicable) was to be used as date of progression. Patients still alive with no evidence of disease progression at the time of their last visit or for whom date of first documented progression was not applicable, were censored at the time of the last examination. PFS analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Gene Signature, PFS was defined and calculated as the time from first treatment to either the first progression of the disease or the date of death, whichever occurred first. In case a patient went off protocol treatment, the date of first documented progression (if applicable) was to be used as date of progression. Patients still alive with no evidence of disease progression at the time of their last visit or for whom date of first documented progression was not applicable, were censored at the time of the last examination. PFS analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) After Slow Progressive Disease (SPD) by Gene Signature, PFS after initial SPD was defined and calculated as the time from the time point at which the disease was the most advanced during the treatment to either a new progression of the disease or the date to death, whichever occurred first as another secondary outcome of this study. In that case, the largest diameter during the course of treatment was to be used as reference measurement. This outcome was defined to take into account the delay to induce an active immune response and the strict rules set up in this study to allow pursuing investigational treatment in case of SPD. PFS after SPD analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method., During the entire study, up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS) by Gene Signature, OS was defined as the time from first treatment to the date of death.
