Efficacy Study of a Low Volume of Water Intake and Mosapride for Endoscopy in Patients With Subtotal Gastrectomy
A low volume of water intake and mosapride will effectively reduce food residue in remnant stomach for patients who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy due to gastric cancer.
Foreign Body Left During Endoscopic Examination
DRUG: Mosapride
Degrees of food residue using endoscopic scoring system, We plan to evaluate how much a low volume of water and mosapride, compared with routine fasting, reduse food residue in gastric remnant for endoscopy., six months
Tolerability of a low volume of water and mosapride, We plan to evaluate tolerability of a low volume of water and mosapride compared with routine fasting for endoscopy preparation in patients with subtotal gastrectomy, six months
We evaluate that a 500mL of water intake and mosapride will effectively reduce food residue in remnant stomach for patients who had undergone subtotal gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. We plan to compare this method with routine midnight fasting method for endoscopy in patients with subtotal gastrectomy.
