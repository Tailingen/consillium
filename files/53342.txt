Study to Evaluate IMP9064 as a Monotherapy or in Combination in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMP9064 as monotherapy or in combination with PARP inhibitor Senaparib in patients with advanced solid tumors
Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: IMP9064
Incidence of adverse events (Safety and Tolerability), Safety and tolerability as determined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including severe AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), 11 months|To determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose, Maximum Tolerable Dose (if any)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose of IMP9064 monotherapy, 11 months
To determine Maximum concentration (Cmax), The plasma concentration data of IMP9064 from this study will be analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM), 11 months|To determine area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t), The plasma concentration data of IMP9064 from this study will be analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM), 11 months|To assess Overall response rate (ORR), Anti-tumor activity of IMP9064 monotherapy assessed as Overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST version 1.1 in AST patients, 11 months|To assess Disease control rate (DCR), Anti-tumor activity of IMP9064 monotherapy assessed as Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST version 1.1 in AST patients, 11 months|To assess Duration of response(DOR), Anti-tumor activity of IMP9064 monotherapy assessed as Duration of response(DOR) according to RECIST version 1.1 in AST patients, 11 months|To assess Progression free survival(PFS), Anti-tumor activity of IMP9064 monotherapy assessed as Progression free survival(PFS) according to RECIST version 1.1 in AST patients, 11 months|To assess Overall survival(OS), Anti-tumor activity of IMP9064 monotherapy assessed as Overall survival(OS) according to RECIST version 1.1 in AST patients, 11 months|To assess QT interval, To assess correlation between plasma concentrations of IMP9064 and QT interval, 11 months
IMP9064 is an investigational therapeutic protein that may prevent repair of DNA damage in tumor cell. IMP9064 acts as inhibitor (blocker)of the proteins ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) which are important in cancer cell DNA repair. If cancer cells cannot repair damage to their DNA, then there is a high possibility that cancer cells will not survive.
