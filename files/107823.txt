Safety and Efficacy of IV Nerofeâ„¢ Followed by Doxorubicin, In Metastatic Ovarian Cancer and Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, Dose Confirmation study. Subjects will be treated, once a week, with IV doses of Nerofe and low dose (20 mg/m2) Doxorubicin (6-8 hours from one another) in consecutive, 28-day cycles.
Metastatic Ovarian Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Nerofe is a first in class derivative of a human hormon-peptide(TCApF), with Cancer suppressive properties.
The primary safety endpoint will be the Adverse Events (AE) reported during the combined treatment of Nerofe and low Dose doxorubicin , using the CTCAE score., The Adverse Events (AE) reported during the combined treatment of Nerofe and low Dose doxorubicin, using the CTCAE score., Safety data will be collected weekly during the subjects visits(Weeks 1-20), throughout the study and up to 1 year.|Assessing Change in tumor size from Baseline to End of study, Assessing Change in tumor size from Baseline to End of study under combined treatment of Nerofe and Low dose Doxorubicin in Ovarian cancer or triple negative breast cancer. Subject population will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, from Baseline, and every 2 cycles( 8 weeks), and last one- at the end of the study., Imaging would be performed at Baseline and at the end of every 2 cycles(8 weeks), through the study completion, which is estimated to be after 6 months.|Assessing Change in Blood markers from Baseline to End of study, Assessing Change in tumor size from Baseline to End of study, under combined treatment of Nerofe and Low dose Doxorubicin, in Ovarian cancer or triple negative breast cancer.

Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 30-33 days after the last dosing of study drug. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal criteria - may continue to receive Nerofe \& Doxorubicin for up to 5 cycles, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the Clinical Safety Committee (CSC).
