Proton MR Spectroscopy of Brain Metastases in Evaluation of Treatment Response.
The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of in vivo single volume MR spectroscopy in evaluation of treatment response in patients with brain metastases, using 3T MR instrument. In order to optimize and avoid ineffective treatment of patients with brain metastases, in vivo MR spectroscopy can be an useful tool.
