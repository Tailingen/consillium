Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Everolimus Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Local Radiology Review of Tumor Assessment, PFS was defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. A patient who had not progressed or died at the date of the analysis cut-off or received another anticancer therapy had their PFS censored at the time of the last adequate tumor evaluation before the earlier of the cut-off date or the anticancer therapy date. Disease progression was assessed using the local investigator's tumor assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1.

The distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS, along with 90% CI. As this was an estimation based approach, no p-value was provided., From randomization up to date of first documented progression or death, assessed up to approximately 3.5 years

Deterioration was considered definitive if no improvements in the ECOG PS status were observed after an instance of deterioration. Death was considered as worsening of the ECOG PS if it occurred close to the last assessment, where "close" is defined as twice the planned period between two assessments. Participants who died after more than twice the planned period between two assessments were censored at the date of their last assessment before the cut-off. Participants receiving any further anticancer therapy prior to definitive worsening were censored at their date of last assessment prior to start of therapy. Participants that had not worsened were censored at the date of last assessment prior to cut off. Time to definitive deterioration was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization up to definitive deterioration of the ECOG PS by one categotu of the score, assessed up to approximately 3.5 years|Everolimus Predose Concentration (Cmin), Blood samples were collected to assess everolimus predose concentration (Cmin) at steady state at Cycle 1 Week 4 (any day during week 4).

This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating treatment with everolimus (10 mg daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg daily) vs placebo in combination with exemestane (25 mg daily) in Chinese postmenopausal women with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic ER+ HER2- breast cancer refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors.

Randomized participants started the study treatment at Cycle 1 Day 1, and were treated continuously until disease progression (assessed by RECIST 1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from treatment for any other reason.

After end of treatment, all participants were followed up for safety up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (exemestane and/or everolimus/placebo). All participants were followed for survival status at least every 3 months after treatment discontinuation unless they discontinued due to death, consent withdrawal or lost to follow-up

If a participants permanently discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent to efficacy follow-up then they entered the post-treatment efficacy follow-up period until disease progression, death, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent for efficacy follow-up.
