A Study of CLN-619 Alone and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Advanced Solid Tumors
CLN-619-001 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study of CLN-619 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: CLN-619|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose Escalation: TEAEs, Number of treatment-emergent events (TEAEs)

TEAE is defined as adverse events reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug., 24 Months|Dose Expansion: Best Overall Response (BOR), The percentage of patients having a CR or PR as determined by PI assessment of disease response per RECIST 1.1 on at least one scan., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months|Dose Expansion: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients having a CR or PR as determined by PI assessment of disease response per RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months|Dose Expansion: Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the earliest date of CR or PR until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by PI assessment of disease response per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause if occurring sooner than progression., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months|Dose Expansion: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of participants having CR, PR, or SD as best on study response., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months|Dose Expansion: Overall Survival (OS), Time from the initial date of treatment until death., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months|Dose Expansion: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The percentage of participants who achieve CR, PR or SD for a duration of 6 months as determined by PI assessment of disease response per RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks for the first 18 weeks and then every 9 weeks until disease progression; approximately 36 months
All Cohorts: Cmax, Maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: AUC, Area under the curve up to tau (AUCtau) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: Time to Maximum concentration, Time to Cmax (Tmax) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: Clast, Last validated plasma concentration (Clast) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: Time to last plasma concentration, Time to Clast (Tlast) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: Half-life, Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years|All Cohorts: Volume of Distribution, Volume of Distribution (V) of CLN-619, Up to 2 years
