Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Targeting Glypican-3
A Phase I Clinical Study of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Targeting Glypican-3 (CAR-GPC3 T Cells) in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-GPC3 T Cells
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Safety, After 28 days of single infusion|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tolerability, After 28 days of single infusion
Pharmacokinetics (the copies of cells in vivo), Pharmacokinetics is the"Implantation endpoint" which is defined as the number of copies of CAR-GPC3 DNA in peripheral blood at each visit after infusion until any two consecutive test results are negative or below the detection limit. It aims to calculate the Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Day0~Week 26|Pharmacokinetics ( the duration of survival of cells in vivo), Duration of CAR-GPC3 T cell persistence is the period from the day of infusion to the first negative test result or result lower than the detection limit.It aims to calculate the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Day0~Week 26|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Adverse events up to 24 months of follow-up visit judged by the investigator to be associated with CAR-GPC3T cell infusion, such as abnormalities or changes in laboratory examinations, physical examinations, vital signs, etc., Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Progression-free survival (PFS), The period from the day when the subject receives the infusion of cells to the first recorded tumor progression (whether treated or not) or death of any cause, which occurs first., Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Duration of response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD(Progressive Disease) or death of any cause., Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Duration of disease control (DDC), The period from the first evaluation of CR, PR, or SD to the first evaluation of PD or any cause of death., Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Overall survival (OS), The period from the first infusion to any cause of death, Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Objective response rate (ORR);, The number of cases in which tumor size is reduced to PR or CR / the total number of evaluable cases (%). In the event of PR or CR, the subjects should confirm it no less than 4 weeks after the first evaluation, Month 24|Antitumor efficacy-Disease control rate (DCR), The number of cases in which response (PR + CR) and stable disease (SD) are achieved from the start of cell infusion/the total number of evaluable cases (%)., Month 24
This is a phase I open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial designed to observe and evaluate the safety, cell metabolokinetics, and efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused intravenously at single escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Primary objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-GPC3 T cells infused intravenously at escalating doses in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Secondary objectivesï¼š

* To evaluate the metabolic kinetics of single infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells
* To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of infusion of CAR-GPC3 T cells
* To observe the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
