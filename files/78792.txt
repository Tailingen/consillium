Collection of Blood and/or Bone Marrow for Investigation and Characterization of Normal and Abnormal Cell Growth
The collection of Blood and/or Bone Marrow from patients with blood disorders, blood cell malignancies and associated conditions will serve as a convenient and comprehensive source of tissue to give us further information about the differences between normal blood cells and blood cells of affected individuals. This will be an invaluable asset for understanding the biology of blood disorders. The collected samples will be used by investigators for studies including immunology, molecular biology and genetics to name a few.
Leukemia
The study is designed to collect blood and bone marrow from patients with various hematological diseases., The study is designed to collect blood and bone marrow from patients with various hematological diseases. The samples will be used for various research studies for better understanding of biology of various blood disorders including hematological malignancies. Relevant clinical and laboratory features and subsequent changes will be noted for correlation with these studies. The tissue/cells will be additionally banked and/or used for other investigations in the future., On average, indefinite, or until death of participant
Collection of Blood and/or Bone Marrow for Investigation and Characterization of Normal and Abnormal Cell Growth in Patients With Malignancy or Hematologic Disorders, Develop a database of subjects who have donated samples for research as well as tissue banking, some of whom may be contacted again for consideration of additional studies in the future., On average, indefinite, or until death of participant
