Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer (ACTS-GC)
This controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of TS-1 on survival compared with surgery alone. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either surgery alone or surgery followed by treatment with TS-1 within 45 days after curative resection (curability A or B). To assess the efficacy, data on recurrence and survival will be collected from the time of enrollment until 5 years after surgery. To evaluate safety, data on adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until 1 year after surgery.
