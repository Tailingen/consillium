A Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Chinese Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell ALL. The objective of the study is to confirm the efficacy, safety, and PK of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL from mainland China.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: inotuzumab ozogamicin
Percentage of Participants With Hematologic Remission (Complete Remission [CR]/Complete Remission With Incomplete Hematologic Recovery [CRi]) per Investigator Assessment, CR was the disappearance of leukemia indicated by less than (\<) 5 percent (%) marrow blasts \& absence of peripheral blood leukemic blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (≥)1000 per microliter (/μL) \& platelets ≥100,000/μL. C1 extramedullary disease status (i.e. complete disappearance of measurable \& non-measurable extramedullary disease with the following exceptions: for participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, all nodal masses greater than (\>) 1.5 centimeters (cm) in greatest transverse diameter (GTD) at baseline must have regressed to less than or equal to (≤) 1.5 cm in GTD; all nodal masses ≥1 cm \& ≤1.5 cm in GTD at baseline must have regressed to \<1 cm GTD or reduced by 75% in sum of products of greatest diameters, no new lesions, spleen \& other previously enlarged organs must have regressed in size \& must not be palpable) was required. CRi was defined as CR except ANC \<1000/μL \&/or platelets \<100,000/μL., Screening, Day 16 to 28 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3, then every 1 to 2 cycles (or as clinically indicated) up to approximately 4 weeks (end of treatment [EoT]) from the last dose
Duration of Remission (DoR) for Participants Who Achieved CR/CRi, DoR was defined as time from date of first response in responders (CR/CRi per Investigator assessment) to date of PFS event (i.e., death, progressive disease \[objective progression, relapse from CR/CRi or treatment discontinuation due to global deterioration of health status\] or starting new induction therapy or post-therapy stem cell transplant \[SCT\] without achieving CR/CRi). Participants without a DoR event at a time of analysis will be censored at the date of last valid disease assessment including follow-up disease assessment。, Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Percentage of Participants Achieving MRD Negativity (Based on Central Laboratory Analysis) in Participants Achieving a CR/CRi, Bone marrow aspirate, collected at screening and for remission status and assessment of MRD. MRD will be assessed using NGS for rearranged IgH, IgK, and IgL receptor gene sequences at a central laboratory. MRD analysis will be done at least once in patients with prior assessment of CR or CRi. MRD-negativity will be defined as malignant B lymphocytes occurring at a frequency of \<10\^-4., Up to approximately 4 weeks (EoT) from last dose of study drug|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as time from date of randomization to earliest date of the following events: death, progressive disease (objective progression, relapse from CR/CRi or treatment discontinuation due to global deterioration of health status) and starting new induction therapy or post-therapy SCT without achieving CR/CRi. Participants without a PFS event at time of analysis were censored at the last valid disease assessment. In addition, participants with documentation of an event after an unacceptably long interval (\>28 weeks if there was post-baseline disease assessment, or \>12 weeks if there was no post-baseline assessment) since the previous disease assessment were censored at the time of the previous assessment (date of randomization if no post-baseline assessment). Post-study treatment follow-up disease assessments was included. Kaplan-Meier method used and 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method., Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first dose to date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact., Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Percentage of Participants Who Had a Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplant (HSCT), HSCT rate is defined as the percentage of participants who proceed to HSCT among participants who take at least one dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin., Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Type and severity (including severity per National Cancer Institutes \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\], version 5.0), including Veno-Occlusive Liver Disease (VOD)/Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) (total, during study treatment, and post-HSCT), Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Percentage of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Type and severity (including severity per National Cancer Institutes \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\], version 5.0), Up to approximately 2 years from first dose|Maximum Observed Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Serum Concentration (Cmax) Following Single and Multiple Dosing, Cmax was the maximum observed concentration occurring between 0-8 hours post-dose., Days 1, 4, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4|Percentage of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA), Analysis will be performed by central laboratory., Day 1 of Cycle 1-6 and up to approximately 4 weeks (end of treatment [EoT]) from the last dose|Pre-Dose Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Serum Concentration (Ctrough) Following Single and Multiple Dosing, Ctrough was the concentration prior to subsequent dose (pre-dose) occurring after 8 hours., Days 1, 4, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4|Percentage of Participants With Neutralizing Antibodies (Nab)., Analysis will be performed by central laboratory., Day 1 of Cycle 1-6 and up to approximately 4 weeks (end of treatment [EoT]) from the last dose
