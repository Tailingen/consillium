Development of a Novel Methodology Using BMVC Staining as an Assistance to Cancer Cytological Diagnosis
3,6-bis(1-methyl-4-vinylpyridinium) carbazole diiodide (BMVC) is an inorganic chemical compound (Figure1). The uptake of BMVC in cancer cells and normal cells are different. Recently, a simple handheld device (Figure1) based on the fluorescence analysis of stained cells was established to instantly differentiate cancer cells from normal cells. The investigators want to quantitatively measure the fluorescence expression of BMVC in normal and cancer cells and explore the usefulness of this staining in head and neck lumps.
