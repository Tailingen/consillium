Identification of Multiple Pulmonary Diseases Using Volatile Organic Compounds Biomarkers in Human Exhaled Breath
The goal of this observational study is to develop an advanced expiratory algorithm model utilizing exhaled breath volatile organic compound (VOC) marker molecules. This model aims to accurately diagnose mutiple pulmonary diseases. The primary objectives it strives to accomplish are:

1. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of an exhaled breath VOC-assisted diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) model in diagnose several common pulmonary diseases.
2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of an exhaled breath VOC-assisted diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) model in diagnose more pulmonary diseases.

This is a prospective, cross-sectional, observational cohort study aimed at recruiting 10,000 participants with multiple pulmonary disease, including lung cancer, lung infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary arterial hypertension, tuberculosis, lung abscess, emphysema, radioactive lung injury, cystic fibrosis of the lung, Bronchial Asthma, Bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm) etc . Exhaled breath samples from these participants will be collected and analyzed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS) and micro Gas Chromatography-photoionisation detector (μGC-PID) system. Upon obtaining the μGC-PID results, a comprehensive evaluation of the diagnostic capabilities of exhaled breath samples in differentiating various pulmonary diseases will be performed, leveraging clinical diagnostic results, CT examination data, and clinical data.
