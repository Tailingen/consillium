Study of Oral Navitoclax Tablet in Combination With Oral Ruxolitinib Tablet Versus Best Available Therapy to Assess Change in Spleen Volume in Adult Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a rare blood cancer, notable for scarring of the bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside bones) and the spleen becoming larger. The purpose of this study is to assess safety and change in spleen volume when navitoclax is given in combination with ruxolitinib, compared to best available therapy, for adult participants with MF.

Navitoclax is an investigational drug (not yet approved) being developed for the treatment of MF. Participants in this study will be randomly selected (like picking numbers out of a hat) to be in 1 of 2 treatment arms. Neither participants nor the study doctor will be able to pick which treatment arm a participants enters. In Arm A, participants will receive navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib. In Arm B, participants will receive the best available therapy (BAT) for MF. In Arm C, participants will receive navitoclax. Adult participants with a diagnosis of MF that came back or did not get better after earlier treatment will be enrolled. Approximately 330 participants will be enrolled in approximately 322 sites across the world.

In Arm A, participants will receive navitoclax tablet by mouth once daily with by mouth ruxolitinib tablet twice daily. In Arm B, participants will receive the BAT available to the investigator. In Arm C, participants will receive navitoclax tablet by mouth once daily. Participants will receive the study drug until they experience no benefit (determined by the investigator), participants cannot tolerate the study drugs, or participants withdraw consent. The approximate treatment duration is about 3 years.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.
