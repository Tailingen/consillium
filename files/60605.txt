Combination of Dasatinib and Peg-Interferon Alpha 2b in First Line for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase
Interferon alpha was a therapy used in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic phase prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Synergistic effect of the combination of Peg-IFNα2a with Imatinib was demonstrated in the clinical SPIRIT trial. In this study, the investigators address the question of the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in combination with low dose of Peg-IFNα-2b as frontline therapy for patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic phase.
Chronic Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Peg-Interferon alpha2b
Cumulative rate of molecular response, Molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) is defined by either a positive BCR-ABL/ABL ratio ≤ 0.0032 on the international scale or by undetectable BCR-ABL with the analysis of at least 32000 copies of ABL (according to the ELN recommendations by N. Cross et al., leukemia 2012).

Centralized analyses of molecular response by RTQPCR will be performed for all molecular assessments in this study., at 12 months.
