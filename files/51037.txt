Phase I/II Study of Escalating Doses of Idarubicin Orally Given With Oral Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Prednisolone and Intravenous Rituximab in Elderly Patient With Disseminated High Grade Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
R-CHOP with doxorubicin is the standard first line treatment of high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In order to avoid central venous system insertion and reduce hospitalization time in elderly patients, we developed an oral chemotherapy treatment: " OROCIEP"trial.

Nineteen patients were enrolled and 127 chemotherapy cycles were available for toxicities. The estimated two-years overall survival was 74%. The main haematological toxicity was neutropenia.

This study is still ongoing to confirm recommended dose of oral anthracycline.
High Grade Lymphomas CD20 Positive
DRUG: idarubicin
Maximum tolerated dose of idarubicin, 9 months
