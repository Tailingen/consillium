SHOrt Course Radiation and TASOX (TAS102 Plus Oxaliplatin) Chemotherapy in Operable Rectal Cancer
TASOX can be safely and efficaciously delivered after short course radiation, resulting in significant pathologic downstaging, allowing for an R0 pelvic resection, and providing local control in appropriately selected stage II/III rectal cancer patients treated with contemporary TME-based surgery.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: TAS 102|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Achieve a reduction by at least 5.8 in Neoadjuvant Response (NAR) score compared to historic controls with NAR of 14.59, determine whether pre-operative short-course radiation therapy (SRT) and 6 cycles of TASOX offers condensed radiation and total neoadjuvant therapy for intermediate risk rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 6 months
Safety and Tolerability, The secondary objective is to describe Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and surgery complications among treated subjects., Through study completion, an average of 6 months
In this phase II study patients will be treated with short-course preoperative irradiation (25 Gy in five fractions of 5 Gy) followed by 6 (six) 2-week cycles of TASOX followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) for patients with resectable rectal cancer (clinical T3c/dN0, T3c/dN1, T2N1). Eligible study subjects include adults who are candidates for curative intent sphincter-sparing surgery and lack high risk features such as tumor encroaching upon the mesorectal-fascia or low tumors who need an Abdominal-Perineal Resection (APR).
