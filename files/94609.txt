Alvocidib Biomarker-driven Phase 2 AML Study
The purpose of this two-stage Phase 2 study is to assess the clinical response (Complete Remission) of ACM (Alvocidib/Cytarabine/Mitoxantrone) compared to CM (Cytarabine/Mitoxantrone) treatment in refractory or relapsed AML patients with demonstrated MCL-1 dependence of ≥ 30% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Alvocidib|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Mitoxantrone
Complete Response (CR) Rate in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory AML, Complete Remission (CR) rate = Percentage of patients achieving CR after Cycle 1 as defined in Stage 1 by the International Working Group (IWG) Criteria and 2010 European LeukemiaNet (EN) criteria in patients with relapsed or refractory AML with MCL-1 dependence \>30% and in Stage 2 by the 2017 ELN criteria.

The study was terminated in January 2020 due to a steady and marked reduction in enrollment. Thus, the efficacy endpoints could not be analyzed. As sufficient efficacy results were not available to analyze patients based on the percentage of MCL-1 dependency the treatment efficacy was summarized by distributing the safety population into 6 groups based on whether the patients received the ACM vs CM regimen and their disease stages at study entry., Best response after at least 1 cycle through study completion approximately 4 years
Response to Treatment, To determine if treatment with ACM can induce CR in patients with relapsed or refractory AML with MCL-1 dependence of \>30% who failed to achieve CR following 1 cycle of CM, Best response after at least 1 cycle through study completion approximately 4 years
In Stage 1 of the study, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated MCL-1 dependence of ≥ 30% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will receive treatment with ACM.

In Stage 2, all eligible AML patients with demonstrated MCL-1 dependence of ≥ 30% by mitochondrial profiling in bone marrow will be randomized 1:1 to receive either treatment with ACM or CM.
