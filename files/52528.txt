Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy
Multi-center prospective randomized trial of single port laparoscopic surgery (SILS) versus conventional 3-4 ports laparoscopic hysterectomy. Hypothesis is that conversion rate of SILS is not inferior to that of conventional approach.

PROCEDURE: Single incision Laparoscopic hysterectomy|PROCEDURE: Conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy
Conversion rate, Conversion means that events required additional port(s) or open laparotomy, 1 week
Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), 12 weeks|Postoperative pain, Measured by numeric rating score (NRS), postop. 1 day, 1 week
