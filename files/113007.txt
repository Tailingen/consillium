Saruparib (AZD5305) Plus Camizestrant Compared With CDK4/6 Inhibitor Plus Endocrine Therapy or Plus Camizestrant in HR-Positive, HER2-Negative (IHC 0, 1+, 2+/ ISH Non-amplified), BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2m Advanced Breast Cancer
The primary objective of the study is to measure efficacy of saruparib (AZD5305) plus camizestrant compared with physician's choice CDK4/6i plus ET in patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2m, HR-positive, HER2-negative (defined as IHC 0, 1+, 2+/ ISH non-amplified) advanced breast cancer

Progression-Free Survival, PFS is defined as time from randomisation until progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 59 months
Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 88 months|Progression Free Survival 2, PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation to the earliest of the progression event (following the initial investigator-assessed progression), after first subsequent therapy, or death., Up to approximately 59 months|Time to chemotherapy, Time to chemotherapy is defined as time from randomisation until the start date of the first subsequent chemotherapy treatment after discontinuation of randomised treatment (censoring participants who died prior to initiation of chemotherapy)., Up to approximately 59 months|Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete or parial response, as determined by BICR per RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 59 months|Duration of Response, DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 59 months|Participant-reported tolerability, Proportion of all dosed participants reporting different levels of severity of diarrhoea as measured by the diarrhoea single item (EORTC IL237/IL239/IL240) and different levels of severity of abdominal pain as measured by the abdominal pain single item (EORTC IL237/IL239/IL240)., Up to approximately 59 months|Time to deterioration in patient-reported global health status/QoL as measured by the global health status/QoL scale within the The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ), This scale includes 2 items asking participants to report overall health and overall quality of life in the past week. Both items are measured on a 6-point verbal rating scale ranging from Very Poor to Excellent. Single item scores are averaged to calculate a subscale score that is transformed to range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better global health status/QoL., Up to approximately 59 months|Change from baseline in patient-reported global health status/QoL as measured by the global health status/QoL scale within the The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ), This scale includes 2 items asking participants to report overall health and overall quality of life in the past week. Both items are measured on a 6-point verbal rating scale ranging from Very Poor to Excellent. Single item scores are averaged to calculate a subscale score that is transformed to range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better global health status/QoL., Up to approximately 59 months|Plasma concentrations of saruparib (AZD5305), Up to approximately 59 months|Plasma concentrations of camizestrant, Up to approximately 59 months|Samples will be used to develop companion diagnostics by analyzing their performance characteristics and calculate their consistency with clinical trial assays used for enrolment onto the study., Samples will be tested by a CDx to confirm BRCA1/2 and PALB2 gene mutation status, Up to approximately 59 months
Approximately 2,620 participants will be screened to achieve approximately 500 participants randomised to study intervention.

Participants will be randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of the following intervention groups:

* Arm 1: saruparib (AZD5305) plus camizestrant
* Arm 2: Physician's choice CDK4/6i plus physician's choice ET
* Arm 3: Physician's choice CDK4/6i plus camizestrant Treatment continues until BICR-confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the participant withdraws consent.
