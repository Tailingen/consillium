Anti-tumor Specific Immune Response in Head and Neck Cancers
The purpose is the description of anti-tumor immune responses in general and according to clinical stage and disease free survival (DFS: survival without recurrence (local or distant)) in patients with Head \& Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Secondary purposes are:

* Study of relationship between anti-tumor immune response and qualitative (yes/no) and quantitative (number) presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs);
* Study of relationship between qualitative (yes/no) and quantitative (number) presence of CTCs and clinical stage as well as DFS
* Study of relationship between anti-tumor immune response and clinical stage as well as DFS.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
OTHER: Blood sample
