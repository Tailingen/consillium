Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of BAT8008 for Injection
Objectives:To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8008 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors, explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and provide the recommended dose for subsequent clinical trials.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: BAT8008 for Injection
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as grade 3 or higher toxicity associated with the investigational product that occurred within 21 days of the subject's initial administration, At the end of Cycle 1( first cycle is 21 days, subsequent cycles are 14 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as exploration in a dose group observed ≤1/6 of subjects during the DLT evaluation period to the highest dose level of DLT., At the end of Cycle 1( first cycle is 21 days, subsequent cycles are 14 days)
AUC(0-inf)after cycle 6 administration, The area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity, 91 days after first dose of BAT8008
Presence of ADA/nentralizing antibodies（NAbs）, presence of anti-drug antibody/ nentralizing antibodies, 91 days after first dose of BAT8008
In this multi-center, open, dose-increasing, dose-expanding Phase I clinical study, rapid titration and a "3+3" dose-increasing design were used to explore the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of BAT8008 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. During the dose-escalation test, appropriate doses were selected for the extended study according to the previous study data.
