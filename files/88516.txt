Anti-PD-1 Antibody Treatment With Cemiplimab and Radiotherapy in Early-stage Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
The primary objective is to estimate the efficacy of experimental treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody cemiplimab (REGN2810) in combination with simultaneous or subsequent radiotherapy (RT) in early-stage favorable classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

Secondary objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of the 2 experimental strategies.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Cemiplimab|RADIATION: Involved-site radiotherapy (IS-RT)
Progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year, From randomization up to 1 year
PFS at 2 and 3 years, From randomization up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, and 3 years, From randomization up to 3 years|Incidence of acute toxicities, Up to 90 days after study treatment|Rate of patients with long-term fatigue using EORTC-QLQ-FA12, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ).

-FA12 module complements the core EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire regarding fatigue. Each item can be scored in four dimension on a scale from 1 to 4 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms., 12-18 months after randomization|Rate of patients with long-term fatigue using EORTC-QLQ-C30, Scores range from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., 12-18 months after randomization|Quality of life (QoL) using EORTC-QLQ-30, Scores range from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to 3 years|Rate of early discontinuation of study treatment, From first dose to up to 19 weeks|Frequency of lymphoma treatment administered in addition to study treatment, From randomization up to 3 years|Types of lymphoma treatment administered in addition to study treatment, From randomization up to 3 years
