A Study of SYS6040 for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is the first-in-human Phase I study of SYS6040 for injection, comprising two phases: Dose escalation with backfill (Phase Ia) and cohort expansion (Phase Ib).The planned study population consists of subjects with advanced solid tumors.The objective is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of SYS6040 for injection as monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.

The dose escalation phase utilizes a BOIN design for dose escalation. Subjects in five predefined dose groups will administer investigational product via intravenous infusion. Subjects will be enrolled in groups of 3 for treatment.The first treatment cycle (21 days) will serve as the DLT observation window, with dose escalation/de-escalation decisions based on DLT occurrences.

Each cohort is planned to enroll 20-40 subjects, receiving RP2D doses every 3 weeks (Day 1).

Subjects will receive RP2D doses in 21-day treatment cycles until PD, intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawal, loss to follow-up, investigator-determined unsuitability for continued treatment, death, or study termination, whichever occurs first.
