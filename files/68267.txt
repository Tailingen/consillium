A Study of PT0253 in Participants With KRAS G12D Mutated Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of PT0253 in adult participants with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12D mutated advanced solid tumors as monotherapy.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: PT0253
Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), Cycle 1 (Cycle length=21 days)|Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Up to 24 months|Number of Participants with TEAEs Leading to Treatment Interruptions, Dose Reductions and Permanent Discontinuations, Up to 24 months
Cmax/C0: Maximum Blood Concentration (Cmax) and/or Concentration at Time 0 (C0) of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach Cmax of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|AUC0-t: Area Under the Curve From time 0 to the time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|t1/2: Terminal Elimination Half-life of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|AUC0-âˆž: Area Under the Curve From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinity of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|CL: Clearance of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|Vd: Volume of Distribution of PT0253, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15: Pre-infusion and up to 24 hours post-infusion (Cycle length=21 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be determined by radiographic disease assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be determined by radiographic disease assessments per RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment up to death due to any cause., At 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS will be determined by radiographic disease assessments per RECIST 1.1., At 1 year
