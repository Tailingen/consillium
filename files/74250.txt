A Study to Examine the Effectiveness of Aspirin and/or Vitamin D3 to Prevent Prostate Cancer Progression
To demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of recruitment to a randomised chemoprevention study of standard (300mg) or low dose (100mg) aspirin vs. placebo and/or Vitamin D3 vs. placebo in patients enrolled on an Active Surveillance programme for prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: High dose Aspirin & Vitamin D|DRUG: High dose Aspirin, Vitamin D placebo|DRUG: Low dose Aspirin , Vitamin D|DRUG: Low dose Aspirin, Vitamin D placebo|DRUG: Aspirin Placebo, Vitamin D|DRUG: Aspirin placebo, Vitamin D placebo
Rate of Patient Recruitment to a Randomised Chemoprevention Study in Men Enrolled on an Active Surveillance Programme for Prostate Cancer. Number Accrued Per Month., The proportion of eligible patients that join the trial over the 12-month trial recruitment period., 12 months
Response to Treatment as Determined by Serial Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Prostate. New Lesion Present or Existing Lesion + or - in Size., Radiological progression was defined as 'development of a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4/5 lesion (17) on mpMRI, where no lesion was identified before, 33% volume increase in the size of the lesion, or radiological upstaging to T3 or above based on local site reports.' Absence of these features represented radiologically stable disease.

Lesion on multi-parametric imaging where no MRI lesion at screening. An MRI scan shows a screening + or - in volume by \> 33%, or an upgrading of MRI stage of disease to â‰¥3., 3 years|Number of Participants With Biochemical (PSA) Disease Progression, 50% increase in serum Prostate Specific Antigen at 12 months from baseline., 12 months|Number of Participants With Histological Disease Progression, Histological disease progression will be defined as an increase in Gleason scores from: Gleason 3+3 to Gleason score 7 or higher Gleason 3+4 (score 7) to 4+3 (score 7) or Gleason 4+3 to a higher score

Or a 50% increase in maximum cancer core length (MCCL), 3 years|Number of Patients With Adverse With Toxicity, Allergy or Symptoms From Aspirin or Vitamin D, Aspirin toxicity: Haemorrhagic stroke, anaphylaxis following administration, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring intervention (both medical and surgical)

Vitamin D3 toxicity: Hypercalcaemia, Anaphylaxis, 18 months + 30 days
The PROVENT study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled feasibility study to examine the clinical effectiveness of aspirin and/or Vitamin D3 to prevent disease progression in men on Active Surveillance for prostate cancer

The main outcome measure of the trial is the rate of patient recruitment to a randomised chemoprevention study in men enrolled on an Active Surveillance programme for prostate cancer

Secondary outcomes include the response to treatment as determined by serial multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, biochemical disease progression and histological disease progression after 12 months of therapy and finally toxicity and/or allergy to both aspirin and Vitamin D3.
