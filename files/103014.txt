Erlotinib in Combination With Docetaxel in Advanced Hepatocellular and Biliary Tract Carcinomas
An unmet medical need exists for the successful therapy of patients with advanced hepatocellular and biliary tract malignances, with few and short lived disease responses to chemotherapy for both advanced stage hepatic and biliary carcinomas. Pre-clinical data shows cooperative antitumor activity between an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor and taxanes. The efficacy of erlotinib in combination with docetaxel will be assessed in this trial.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Docetaxel
16 Weeks Progression-free Survival, To determine the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 16 weeks for the combination therapy of erlotinib and docetaxel for subjects in the Biliary stratum, per RECIST criteria. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Start of treatment until disease progression per RECIST criteria up to 16 weeks
Response Rate, Determine the Response Rate Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), 18 months|Overall Survival, Determine Overall Survival, 18 Months
Outline: This is a multi-center study.

Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive treatment as follows until disease progression or excessive toxicities:

* Erlotinib 150 mg p.o. daily on days 2-7, 9-14, 16-28
* Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 IV over 30 min weekly x 3 weeks on days 1, 8, 15

Treatment cycle = 28 days
