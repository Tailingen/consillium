Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Conversion Therapy in Patients With Initially Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of conversion therapy in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
Pathologic response rate, Proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a prespecified value and are able to maintain the minimum time limit, 2 years
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of conversion therapy in patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Exon sequencing, 16SrRNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the protein expression, revealing the mechanism of tumor occurrence and development from the genome level, and providing reference for immunotherapy, targeted drug use and curative effect evaluation of tumors.
