GEM STUDY: Radiation And Yervoy in Patients With Melanoma and Brain Metastases
Ipilimumab adds a clinical benefit to radiation therapy in patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain.

Melanoma is the third most common cancer causing brain metastases, after cancers of the lung and breast, which appears to reflect the relative propensity of melanoma to metastasize to the central nervous system (CNS). Brain metastases are responsible for 20 to 54 percent of deaths in patients with melanoma, and among those with documented brain metastases, these lesions contribute to death in up to 95 percent of cases, with an estimated median overall survival ranging between 1.8 and 10.5 months, depending upon other prognostic factors.

Ipilimumab is an anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in overall survival, either alone (second line) or in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC) in 1st line.

Ipilimumab has shown activity against brain metastases.

According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved label for Yervoy®, the use of glucocorticoids at baseline (commonly prescribed when brain metastases are diagnosed) should be avoided before the administration of ipilimumab. Data show that the use of even high doses of glucocorticoids for the management of immune-related adverse events do not decrease the efficacy of Yervoy®. There is no documented experience on the efficacy of Yervoy® when given concomitantly with radiation therapy and glucocorticoids.

In experimental models, radiation therapy is synergistic to anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) strategies (abscopal effect).

There are no published results from clinical trials on the interaction between radiation therapy and ipilimumab.

DRUG: Ipilimumab
1-year Survival Rate, During treatment period, there will be assessments every cycle. After end of treatment every 3 month., From date of inclusion until the date of first documented date of death from any cause, assessed every 3 weeks during for the first 6 months, then every 3 months. Up to 1 year
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median time from treatment initiation to progression of disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Within 4 weeks before start treatment, week 12, 17+/-1 and every 9 + / -1 weeks until progression up to 12 months after last patient treatment initiation.|Intracranial PFS, median, 6-month PFS rate, Within 4 weeks before start treatment, week 12, 17+/-1 and every 9 + / -1 weeks until progression up to 12 months after last patient treatment initiation.|Extracranial PFS, median, 6-month PFS rate, Within 4 weeks before start treatment, week 12, 17+/-1 and every 9 + / -1 weeks until progression up to 12 months after last patient treatment initiation.|Overall Survival, median value for OS estimated by kaplan meier method, From date of inclusion until the date of first documented date of death from any cause, assessed every 3 weeks during for the first 6 months, then every 3 months.|Response Rate, Measured according to Who response criteria and Immune-related response criteria.

Response for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Within 4 weeks before start treatment, week 12, 17+/-1 and every 9 + / -1 weeks until progression up to 12 months after last patient treatment initiation.|Adverse Event Rates, Number of patients with at least one treatment-related toxicity, classified by grade., From date of inclusion until the date of first documented date of death from any cause or end of study, assessed every 3 weeks during for the first 6 months, then every 3 months.|Rate of Dose Delays/Reductions and Treatment Exposure., Treatment feasibility. Number of patients with treatment delays and reductions, categorized as function of the number of events (reductions/delays), Expected average of 3 weeks during for the first 6 months, then every 3 months.
Correlation of Biomarker Expression and PFS., Translational study. PFS outcome reported by subgroups according to BRAF mutation status, Within 28 days before start treatment, just before the start treatment, then expected average of 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks|Intrapatient Variation of Quantitative Apparent Diffusion Coefficients of Serial Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Baseline and 4 weeks after WBRT
