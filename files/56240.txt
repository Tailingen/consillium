Prehab Prior to Stem Cell Transplantation in Multiple Myeloma
The primary purpose of this study is to see if individuals with Multiple Myeloma are able and interested in taking part in a tailored exercise program while undergoing their chemotherapy prior to a stem cell transplant. We also hope to learn if this type of program, along with a flexible delivery format (in-person and virtual), helps in maintaining or improving physical fitness, muscle mass and strength, and quality of life during chemotherapy.

MOTIVATE is a multi-methods feasibility randomized trial. We will recruit a minimum of 30 individuals with multiple myeloma who are undergoing chemotherapy prior to a Stem Cell Transplant. The study will be conducted in two phases:

Phase I: Feasibility Study The aim of this phase is to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a 10-week exercise intervention compared to physical activity counseling alone.

Phase II: Qualitative Study The aim of this phase is to evaluate the acceptability of the Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL-ME) app design, program delivery/design, and perceived effectiveness of the intervention at the level of the participant.
