Trial Of Pembrolizumab And Nintedanib
Both anti-angiogenesis and anti PD1 immunotherapy have shown beneficial efficacy in solid tumors and in particular in NSCLC. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether the combination of these two approaches is tolerable. Moreover, comprehensive pre-clinical and clinical rationale sustain the hypothesis that anti-VEGF could synergize with immunotherapy for the benefit of the patients.
