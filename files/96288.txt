Evaluation of Myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin treatment on HOMA-index, monitoring glucose and insulin levels in blood, three and six months
Evaluation of Myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin treatment on ovulation, dosage of Progesterone, LH, FSH., three and six months|Evaluation of Myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin treatment on hyperandrogenism, dosage of Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone, Androstenedione., three and six months
This is an open-label clinical trial aimed at evaluating and comparing the effect of myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin treatment on HOMA-index improvement in two different groups of PCOS patients from the Mexican and Italian population. The addition of alpha-lactalbumin helps to increase the intestinal absorption of myo-inositol and consequently improve its effect. The scientific evidence so far available shows that these two groups of PCOS women have a different genetic, nutritional, and behavioural profile. Important factors are body mass index and insulin resistance, both increased in the Mexican women, although among them PCOS prevalence is not higher compared to many other populations. Therefore, the focus of this study is to check the effects of the combined administration of myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin for six months (with a control at three months) e to compare these effects between the two groups of patients, monitoring several hormonal parameters connected to the menstrual cycle regularization.
