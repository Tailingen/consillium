Muscle Parameters and Pathological Response in Breast Cancer Patients
The investigators aimed to accurately measure muscle mass and predict pCR to NAC and its effect on clinical outcomes.
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
OTHER: Neoadjuvant therapy
Sarcopenic index, skeletal muscle area (cm2)/height (m2) et L3 level, Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
Body mass index, weight (kg)/height (m2), Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
Residual cancer burden, Residual cancer burden (RCB) is estimated from routine pathologic sections of the primary breast tumor site and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
In patients with operable breast cancer (BC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the pathological response rate was found to be related to body composition. The success of complete pathologic response (pCR) is a known prognostic factor in BC patients treated with NAC. The investigators aimed to accurately measure muscle mass and predict pCR to NAC and its effect on clinical outcomes.
