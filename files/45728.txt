Role of CXCR2 Ligands/CXCR2 Biological Axis in Pancreatic Cancer
The investigators hypothesize that the CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 biological axis plays an important role in promoting angiogenesis in PC; and that the genetic changes and the microenvironment of the tumor regulate the expression of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 in PC in order to potentiate their angiogenic phenotype. A corollary of this hypothesis is that the cell surface receptors (CXCR2) and the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the angiogenic responses induced by ELR+ CXC-chemokines are potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions in PC.
Chronic Pancreatitis|Pancreatic Cancer
All cause mortality, One year
For pancreatic patients from whom tissue samples will be available, we will examine the association between presence/absence of each marker in the tissue versus the marker level in blood and in pancreatic juice., One year
