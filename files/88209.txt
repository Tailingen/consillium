Functional Status and Quality of Life in Older Patients Undergoing Robotic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
The present study evaluates prospectively the impact of robotic surgery on functional outcome and quality of life in older patients that are operated for colorectal cancer;
Colorectal Surgery|Geriatric Assessment|Quality of Life
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Geriatric Assessment
Change in frailty status G8 status, Measurement of functional status using the G8, Flemish version of the Triage Risk Screening Tool (fTRST), Before and 3-6-12 months after surgery|Change in frailty status GFI status, Measurement of functional status using the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) Screening Tool (fTRST), Before and 3-6-12 months after surgery|Change in Quality of Life, Measurement of QoL using validated EORTC QoL questionnaire, Before and 3-6-12 months after surgery
Percentage (%) of patients demonstrating functional improvement at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, Percentage (%) of patients demonstrating functional decline/improvement at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, 3-6-12 months after surgery|Percentage of patients demonstrating functional recovery at 12 months after initial func-tional decline after surgery, Percentage of patients demonstrating functional recovery at 12 months after initial func-tional decline after surgery, 3-6-12 months after surgery|Percentage of patients demonstrating a significant decrease/improvement of QoL at 3,6,12 months after surgery, Percentage of patients demonstrating a significant decrease/improvement of QoL at 3,6,12 months after surgery, 3-6-12 months after surgery|Conversion-rate to open surgery, Number of patients where surgery can not be completed minimal invasive, during surgery|Length of hospital stay, Time patient spends in hospital, Immediate after surgery|Re-operation and re-admission rate, need for re-intervention or hospitalisation after discharge, < 30 days after surgery|Evolution of post-operative cognition, Mini-cog clock test followed by Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) if abnormal, 3, 6, 12 months post surgery|Postoperative confusion rate, CAM-analysis, 7 days postoperative|30- day post-operative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification), minor and major postoperative complications including anastomotic leakage, < 30 days postoperative|90- day post-operative mortality, number of patients that die after surgery, < 90 days postoperative|1-year patient survival, number of patients that are still alive one year after surgery, 1 year postoperatively|1-year disease free survival, number of patients that do not show disease recurrence during the first postoperative year, 1 year postoperatively|Comparison in outcome parameters between frail patients (abnormal screening) versus fit patients, Comparison in outcome parameters between frail patients (Groningen frailty indicator â‰¥ 4) versus fit patients (frailty indicator \< 4), up till 12 months postoperatively
