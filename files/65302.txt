Study of APG2575 Single Agent and Combination Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CLL/SLL
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and efficacy of APG-2575 single agent and in combination with other therapeutic agents in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: APG-2575|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Adverse events of APG-2575 single agent, Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be graded according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0., Up to 6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days).|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of APG-2575 single agent, ORR is defined by CR+ CRi + PR(according to NCI-WG CLL(2008)) and by CR+PR ( according to NHL Cheson (2007)).Response will be evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks) till complete 6 cycles treatment or one month after last dose., Up to 6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days).|Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) of combination therapy, DLT will be graded according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. DLT will be defined as clinically significant drug-related adverse events during the cycle one., 28 days.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose(RP2D), MTD/RP2D will be determined based on DLTs observed during cycle one., 28 days.
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax of APG-2575 will be assessed in the patients in single agent or combo study. Cmax of ibrutinib will be assessed in the patients treated with APG-2575 combination with ibrutinib., 28 days.|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC of APG-2575 will be assessed in the patients in single agent or combo study. AUC of ibrutinib will be assessed in the patients treated with APG-2575 combination with ibrutinib., 28 days.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of APG-2575 combination therapy, ORR is defined by CR+ CRi + PR(according to NCI-WG CLL(2008)) and by CR+PR ( according to NHL Cheson (2007)).Response will be evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks) till complete 6 cycles treatment or one month after last dose., Up to 6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days).|Minimal residual lesions (MRD) of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow., 2 years.|Survival benefit (PFS) of APG-2575 combination therapy, PFS,Time from the beginning of treatment to the first occurrence of Progressive Disease (PD) or death., 2 years.
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II study of safety, PK, PD and efficacy of APG-2575 as a single agent or in combination with rituximab or ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patients.

This study consists of two parts: The first part is the APG-2575 single agent cohort expansion. The cohort expansion will be conducted at three dose levels of 400 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg. And up to 15 patients are planned to be enrolled at each dose level.

The second part contains two arms: APG-2575 combined with rituximab (Arm A) and APG-2575 combined with ibrutinib (Arm B). Both the two arms consist of two stages: dose escalation stage (first stage) and dose expansion stage (second stage). The first stage is the study of APG-2575 dose escalation combined with rituximab/ibrutinib. APG-2575 dose escalates according to the standard 3+3 design, the initial dose is 200mg, the dose of APG-2575 will be increased in subsequent levels, to 400mg, 600mg, 800mg respectively. The second stage is the MTD/RP2D expansion stage. Once the respective MTD/RP2D of arms A and B is determined, up to 15 subjects in each MTD/RP2D dose level would be enrolled.

APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle.

Rituximab, on cycle 1 day 8(C1D8): 375mg/m2; on cycles 2-6 day l(C2-6D1): 500mg/m2, a total of six infusions.

Ibrutinib 420 mg will be orally administered daily beginning from cycle 1 day 8 and continuously thereafter, every 4 weeks as a cycle.
