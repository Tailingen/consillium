Lymphodepletion Plus Adoptive Cell Transfer With or Without Dendritic Cell Immunization in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Objectives:

The primary objective will be to determine whether patients receiving the combination of dendritic cells and high dose IL-2 (Cohort A) have sustained persistence of infused T cells compared to patients treated with T cells and high dose IL-2 alone.

Secondary endpoints will include evaluations for tumor response and studies to determine whether dendritic cells enhance the infused T cells in anti-tumor activity and their ability to migrate to the tumor site. In addition, we will evaluate the characteristics of the infused T cells that correspond with effectiveness in vivo.

Additionally, secondary objectives will include correlation of clinical parameters with survival (overall survival and progression-free survival) for all cohorts.

COHORT C

In a separate cohort (Cohort C) the primary endpoint will be the overall response rate of TIL treatment for patients who have not achieved PR or CR or have progressive disease from treatment of the BRAF inhibitor alone.

COHORT D

The primary objective of Cohort D is to confirm the safety of adoptively transferred, TIL into the CSF.

The secondary objective is the evaluation of clinical imaging and CSF response. Correlative objectives will assess if the intrathecally-infused T cells persist in the CSF, assess circulating tumor cells in the CSF, and assess various cytokine and other analyses,as feasible.

COHORT E

The primary objective of Cohort E is to determine the overall response rate of TIL treatment with cells grown by the TIL 3.0 pre-REP (Turnstile 1) phase of cellular growth.
