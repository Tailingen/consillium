A Real-world Study: Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
A real-world study: Efficacy and safety of Anlotinib for advanced non-small cell lung cancer：This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the real world, and to summarize the treatment experience of a broad population.
NSCLC
progression-free survival (PFS), the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, 2019.7-2022.7
overall survival (OS), the length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., 2019.7-2022.7|objective response rate (ORR), the percentage of patients on whom a therapy has some defined effect; for example, the cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment, 2019.7-2022.7|disease control rate (DCR), the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents., 2019.7-2022.7
A real-world study: Efficacy and safety of Anlotinib for advanced non-small cell lung cancer：This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the real world, and to summarize the treatment experience of a broad population.This study is a non-interventional, prospective, observational, real-world case study and all registered data are collected from real clinical practice cases. Adult patients diagnosed as advanced non-small cell lung cancer and treated with anlotinib were included. At least one tumor lesion has not been subjected to local treatment such as irradiation in the past, and can be accurately measured, the longest diameter is ≥10 mm.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety.If the last patient reaches the main evaluation index or has intolerable toxic reaction, the observation will be finished, and the first one will prevail.Through Electronic Data Capture System (EDC) system, electronic case report form (eCRF) is used to replace paper-based case report form to collect and manage clinical trial data.
