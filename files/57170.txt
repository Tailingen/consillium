Surgery Plus Chemo Versus Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgery Plus Chemo for Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer
JCOG1801 is a randomized phase III trial which was initiated in Japan in August 2019 to confirm the superiority of preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy for local relapse-free survival over standard treatment, i.e. surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy, for previously non-irradiated locally recurrent rectal cancer.

DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: Preoperative radiotherapy|OTHER: Procedure
Locally recurrent free survival, the period from registration in the trial to either the first event of local relapse or death from any cause and censored at the last date of contact for a living patient, 3-years after registration
Overall survival (OS), s the time from registration to death from any cause and censored at the last date of contact for a living patient, 3-years after registration|Recurrence free survival (RFS), the time from registration to either the first incidence of relapse or death from any cause and censored at the last date of contact for a living patient, 3-years after registration|Local relapse rate, Proportion of local relapse, 3-years after registration|Distant relapse rate, Proportion of distant relapse, 3-years after registration|R0 resection rate, Proportion of patients with pathological R0 resection, 1 month after surgery|Response rate of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (preCRT), Response rate of preCRT (arm B), before surgery|Pathological complete response rate, Pathological complete response rate (arm B), 1 month after surgery|Completeness of the protocol treatment, Proportion of patients who completed the protocol treatment, 8 months after surgery|Adverse event rate, Incidence of adverse events (adverse reactions), 3-years after surgery registration|QOL, QOL after surgery based on the Trial Outcome Index-Physical/Functional/Colorectal (TOI-PFC) \[0(better)-84(worse)\], 3-years after registration
In all, 110 patients from 43 Japanese institutions will be recruited over a period of 6 years. Eligible patients would be registered and randomly assigned to each group with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint is local relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, relapse-free survival, proportion of local relapse, proportion of distant relapse, proportion of patients with pathological R0 resection, response rate of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (preoperative chemoradiotherapy arm), pathological complete response rate (preoperative chemoradiotherapy arm), proportion of patients who completed the protocol treatment, incidence of adverse events (adverse reactions), and quality of life after surgery.
