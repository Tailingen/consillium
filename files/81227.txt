MRI and Fine Needle Aspiration in the Diagnosis of Parotid Tumors
What value is given to MRI diffusion and perfusion sequences in the diagnosis of parotid tumors? Is a fine needle aspiration associated with MRI systematically necessary? The aim of the research is to study the performance of diffusion and perfusion MRI sequences in the diagnosis of parotid tumors on a large series of cases.
