Ventilation Heterogeneity Prior to Lung Resection
This is a single centre prospective six-week observational study to understand the prevalence and clinical relevance of abnormal ventilation of the lung (assessed by Technegas ventilation single photon emission computed tomography (V SPECT) and hyperpolarized 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), in the presence or absence of airway inflammation (assessed by sputum cell counts), in lung cancer patients prior to lung resection surgery.
