A Study of Comparing Talquetamab to Belantamab Mafodotin in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of talquetamab versus belantamab mafodotin in terms of overall response rate (ORR) or progression-free survival (PFS).
Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Talquetamab|DRUG: Belantamab Mafodotin
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response of partial response (PR) or better according to international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria., Up to 1 year 3 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to either progressive disease or death, whichever comes first., Up to 1 year 3 months
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Response Rate, VGPR or better response rate is defined as percentage of participants with best overall response of VGPR or better according to IMWG criteria., Up to 4 years|Complete Response (CR) or Better Response Rate, CR or better response is defined as percentage of participants with best overall response of CR or better according to IMWG criteria., Up to 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to 4 years|Time to Progression on the First Subsequent Line of Therapy or Death, Whichever Comes First (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as time from randomization to progression on the first subsequent line of therapy or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 4 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 4 years|Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening, and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 4 years|Number of Participants with Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Assessments, Number of participants with abnormalities in clinical laboratory assessments (such as serum chemistry and hematology \[including coagulation\]) will be reported., Up to 4 years|Serum Concentration of Talquetamab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of talquetamab using a validated, specific, and sensitive electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) method., Up to 4 years|Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Talquetamab, Number of participants with ADAs to talquetamab will be reported., Up to 4 years|Titers of ADAs to Talquetamab, Titers of ADAs to talquetamab will be reported., Up to 4 years|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), The EORTC-QLQ-C30 Version 3 includes 30 items that make up 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (pain, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting), and 5 single symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea) and a single impact item (financial difficulties). The recall period is 7 days ("past week"), and responses are reported using a verbal and numeric rating scales. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Baseline up to 4 years|Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. For purposes of this study, the EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate utility scores for use in cost-effectiveness analyses. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Baseline up to 4 years|Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire 5-Level (FACT-G), FACT-G is a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure 4 domains of HRQoL in cancer patients: physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. In its Physical Well-Being subscale, the FACT-G includes a question concerning side effect bother (item GP5: "I am bothered by side effects of treatment"), rated on a 5-point Likert scale from "not at all" to "very much." This single item will be included as an overall summary measure of the burden of treatment toxicities compared with each other., Baseline up to 4 years|Time to Sustained Worsening in EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-C30 Version 3 includes 30 items that make up 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (pain, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting), and 5 single symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea) and a single impact item (financial difficulties). The recall period is 7 days ("past week"), and responses are reported using a verbal and numeric rating scales. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to 4 years|Time to Sustained Worsening in EQ-5D-5L, The EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic measure of health status. For purposes of this study, the EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate utility scores for use in cost-effectiveness analyses.

In its Physical Well-Being subscale, the FACT-G includes a question concerning side effect bother (item GP5: "I am bothered by side effects of treatment"), rated on a 5-point Likert scale from "not at all" to "very much."

Multiple myeloma is an incurable, malignant, plasma cell disorder that accounts for approximately 18 percent (%) of hematological malignancies, making it the second most common hematologic malignancy. Talquetamab (also known as JNJ-64407564) is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) bispecific antibody designed to target G Protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D+) cells and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) receptor complex on T-cells. Belantamab mafodotin is a humanized B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to a cytotoxic agent maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) which disrupts the microtubule network, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This study will investigate the possible improvement of ORR or PFS with talquetamab compared with belantamab mafodotin in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 4 prior therapies including an anti-CD38 mAb (alone or in combination), and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor (PI) and one immunomodulatory drug (IMiD). The study will consists of a screening phase, treatment phase (until confirmed progressive disease, start of subsequent antimyeloma therapy, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study, whichever occurs first), and post-treatment follow-up phase (until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or end of the study, whichever occurs first). Safety evaluations will include a review of adverse events, physical examinations, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs.
