Pilot Study Evaluating a Perioperative E-follow-up Protocol in Patients With Ambulatory Surgery for Breast Cancer
This is a monocentric, prospective cohort study evaluating the feasibility of a perioperative e-follow-up protocol in patients with ambulatory surgery for breast cancer.

This protocol will be based on:

* A coordinated ambulatory follow-up performed by a dedicated nurse
* An electronic follow-up tool used in pre- and post-surgery

Patients will be followed 8 days before the surgery until 30 days after the surgery of breast cancer.
