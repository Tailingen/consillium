NKG2D CAR-T(KD-025) in the Treatment of Advanced NKG2DL+ Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, single-arm, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NKG2D-based CAR-T cells infusion in the treatment of advanced NKG2DL+ solid tumors.
Safety Issues
DRUG: KD-025 cell injection
treatment-emergent adverse events(TEAEs), An adverse event is any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient, 3 months after single infusion|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, A drug-related toxicity during treatment with the drug, the severity of which is clinically unacceptable, limiting the further escalation of drug dose., 3 months after single infusion|CAR positive T cells in patients, The time of CAR-T cell reach the peak and turn back to baseline, 6 months after single infusion
Objective response rate(ORR), objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 only, 1month,2month,3month,6month,1 year after cell infusion]|Progression free survival(PFS), the time from the date of first infusion of the KD-025 to the first documented disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, 1month,2month,3month,6month,1 year after cell infusion]|Overall survival #OS#, the time from the date of first infusion of KD-025 to death of the subject, 1month,2month,3month,6month,1 year after cell infusion|Complete remission (CR), the time from the date of first infusion of KD-025 to death of the subject, 1month,2month,3month,6month,1 year after cell infusion
This is an open-label, dose escalation/expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KD-025 cell infusion in patients with advanced NKG2DL+ solid tumor. In this study,the enrollment of the patients must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria . All subjects will be undergo screening, pre-treatment (cell product preparation;lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment and follow up
