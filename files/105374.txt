A Trial to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Ribociclib With Endocrine Therapy as Adjuvant Treatment in Patients With HR+/HER2- Early Breast Cancer
A phase III multi-center, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of ribociclib with endocrine therapy as adjuvant treatment in patients with HR+/HER2- Early Breast Cancer (EBC)
Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ribociclib|OTHER: Endocrine Therapy
Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS), iDFS using STEEP criteria (Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials), as assessed by Investigator. iDFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first event of local invasive breast recurrence, regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, death (any cause), contralateral invasive BC, or second primary non-breast invasive cancer (excluding basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin)., Up to approximately 91 months
Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS using STEEP criteria (Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials). RFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first event of local invasive breast recurrence, regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, or death (any cause)., Up to approximately 91 months|Distant disease-free survival (DDFS), DDFS using STEEP criteria. DDFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of first event of distant recurrence, death (any cause), or second primary non-breast invasive cancer (excluding basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin)., Up to approximately 91 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 91 months|Change from baseline in the global health status Quality of life scale score as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains functional scales, symptom scales, single items scale and a global health status/QoL scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to approximately 91 months|Change from baseline in the physical functioning sub-scale score as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains functional scales, symptom scales, single items scale and a global health status/QoL scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to approximately 91 months|PK parameters: Ctrough and other applicable parameters for ribociclib, Pharmacokinetics of ribociclib: Ctrough and other applicable parameters, Cycle 1 Day 15
The trial will include pre and postmenopausal women and men with HR-positive, HER2-negative EBC, with an Anatomic Stage Group III, IIB or a subset of Stage IIA cases, after adequate surgical resection, radiotherapy (if indicated), adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (if indicated), and who are deemed to be eligible for adjuvant ET for at least 60 months of duration.

Approximately 5,000 patients will be randomized (using an Interactive Response Technology system \[IRT\]) into two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio.

The trial will include screening, treatment, and follow up phases.
