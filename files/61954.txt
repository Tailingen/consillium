Conventional Photodynamic Therapy vs. Painless Photodynamic Therapy for Small Genital Warts
This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time regimen of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy（ALA-PDT) to a conventional regimen for treatment of small genital warts. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach will be less or even no painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.
Genital Warts
PROCEDURE: Aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy
The clearance rate of Genital Warts, The clearance rate of Genital Warts will be measured at one week after the last treatment., one week after the last treatment
Pain assessment, The pain will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale（VAS) with a score range of 0-10. The higher the score, the greater the pain, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most unbearable pain. Pain will be measured at different time points during and after every treatment ，including immediately, 1st min, 3rd min, 5th min, 7th min, 10th min , and every 10 min to the end of treatment and 2nd h, 12th h, 24th h and 48th h after treatment., Immediately, 1st minute, 3rd minute, 5th minute, 7th minute, 10th minute , and every 10 minute to the end of treatment and 2 hours, 12 hours, 24hours and 48 hours after treatment|The recurrence rates after treatment, The recurrence rates will be measured at 3 months after the last treatment., 3 months after the last treatment
