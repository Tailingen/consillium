Radiofrequency Ablation Using Octopus Electrodes for Treatment of Focal Liver Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility and short-term outcome of switching monopolar RFA using a separable cluster electrode in patients with primary and secondary liver malignancies.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Metastasis|Cholangiocarcinoma
DEVICE: Separable cluster electrode (OctopusÂ®)
Major complication rate after Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), Rates of major complication according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) grading system, which refers to an event that leads to substantial morbidity and disability (SIR classification C-E)., 30 days after RFA
Technical success, Technical success addresses that the tumor was treated according to protocol and completely covered by ablative zone on pre-RFA image and post-RFA image side-by-side comparison., 1 day after RFA|Local control rate, Rate of local tumor progression after RFA, 12 months after RFA
total procedure time, total procedure time per patients was recorded., 1 day after RFA|Ablative zone volume, ablative zone volume measurement for each tumor on post-RFA cross sectional imaging, 1 day after RFA
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of minimal invasive treatment methods and it has been showing comparable overall survival with surgery in early or small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and better cost-effectiveness. However, it is suffering from high local tumor progression (LTP) rate. To reduce LTP rate, creation of large ablative zone has been attempted in various strategies. A separable cluster electrode is a new type of RFA electrode. It consists of three individual applicators and the applicators can be incorporated as a single handle such as a cluster electrode, and can be separated as three electrodes, depending on operators' needs. It allows high flexibility to operators and the preclinical results were promising. Herein, we want to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the electrodes by observing major complication rates, technical success rate and 12-months LTP rate.
