"The Impact of Immunonutrition on Gut Microbiota-related Aspects in Colorectal Cancer and Gastric Cancer Patients"
Enteral immunomodulating nutrition modifies the gastrointestinal microbiota as well as improves the intestinal barrier integrity in patients with gastric and colorectal cancer in the perioperative period. As a consequence, it contributes to the reduction of the incidence of postoperative complications and diarrhea, which is a side effect of anti-cancer treatment often used preoperatively in this group of cancers.

The impact of immunonutrition on gut microbiota in gastric and colorectal cancer patients., The composition of gut microbiota (bacteria and fungi) will be assessed from stools. The amounts of bacteria/fungi will be presented using bioinformatics tools and there is no precisely described units (only the total number)., at baseline and after 7 and 10 days
The impact of immunonutrition on intestinal permeability in gastric and colorectal cancer patients., The ratio lactulose/mannitol will be described to assess intestinal permeability. There is no units. Only ratio of two numbers., at baseline and after 7 and 10 days|The impact of immunonutrition on intestines in gastric and colorectal cancer patients., The calprotecin will be assessed. The unit is μg/g., at baseline and after 7 and 10 days
