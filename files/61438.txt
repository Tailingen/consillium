Study of 124I-NM404 in Advanced Solid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess the use of investigational compound 124I-NM404 for accurate detection and characterization of a wide variety of solid primary and metastatic malignancies anywhere in the body.
Triple Negative Breast, Prostate, Colorectal, Gastric, Ovarian, Pancreatic, Esophageal, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, and Head & Neck Cancer
DRUG: 124I-NM404
Optimal Imaging Parameters, To determine the optimal imaging parameters (dose, acquisition time, imaging time post injection, normal organ and tumor dosimetry) of 124I-NM404 in subjects with advanced solid malignancies with one of the following tumor types: triple negative breast, prostate, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, esophageal, soft tissue sarcoma, and head \& neck cancer, 2 years
Adverse events, Number and grade of adverse events attributable to 124I-NM-404, 2 years|PET comparison, compare 18F-FDG PET to 124I-NM404 PET, 2 years
124I-NM404 is a new investigational agent being developed to better identify local tumors and cancerous tumors using imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans. An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is available for research use only. 124I-NM404 is only taken up by the cancer cells, not the normal cells. Compared to traditional methods such as CT (computed tomography) or MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging), 124I-NM404 may help physicians more accurately see and evaluate cancerous tumors. This agent has been safely studied in animals and a limited number of human patients with lung cancer. This study is being done to determine the best dose to use and to fully evaluate the images that result from using this new agent.
