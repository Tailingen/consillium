A Phase I Study of BKM120 in Adult Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Dose escalation study with a dose expansion phase, to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of two dose levels of BKM120 when administered orally.
Advanced Breast Cancer, Advanced Carcinomas With Squamous Cell Histology
DRUG: BKM120
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) for dose escalation with overdose control will guide the dose escalation. The recommended dose is the one with the highest posterior probablity of DLT in the target interval(16%,33%) among the doses fulfilling the overdose criterion that there is less than 25 % chance of excessive toxicity. A clinical synthesis of the available toxicity information including adverse event that are not DLTs, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, efficacy as well as the recommnendations from the BLRM will be used to determine the dose., During Cycle 1 (28 days)

This is a single arm study, with a starting dose of BKM120 at 80mg/day. Two dose levels: 80mg/day and 100mg /day will be tested in the dose escalation phase. At least 3 patients will be enrolled at each dose level and at least 6 evaluable patients required to be treated at the recommended Phase II dose(RP2D)/MTD dose. After dose escalation the 80mg/day and the 100mg /day dose levels will be expanded to evaluate up to approximately a total of 15 patients each (if 100mg is determined as the RP2D/MTD).
