Therapeutic ResistAnce and Clonal Evolution Assessed With Liquid Biopsy in ICIs Treated NSCLC Patients
To evaluate the predictive value of ctDNA in response, relapse for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapy for ALK, ROS1, MET ex14 skipping.
Lung Neoplasms|Lung Cancer, Nonsmall Cell|Adenocarcinoma of Lung|Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Observation
the evolution of ctDNA mutation profile during treatment, ctDNA mutation will be detected, PyClone based clonal analysis will be performed to analyze the clonal dominance, every 2-3 cycles of treatment upon physicians' request, ctDNA mutation analysis and clonal analysis (each cycle is 28 days)
Resistant mechanisms of targeted therapy, Resistant mutations will be identified from ctDNA or tissue mutations, At the time of disease progression (through study completion, an average of 1.5 years)
In the study, 250 advanced NSCLC patients will be recruited. All the patients will receive tissue biopsy and circultating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy before entry the study. Patients who have no actionable mutations in EGFR or ALK and receive ICIs treatment and patients who carry actionable ROS1 fusion, ALK fusion or MET exon 14 skipping mutation and receive TKI treatment according to guidelines will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. The study will be ended when over 70% of the patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion.
