A Phase I/II Study of Azacitidine, Docetaxel, and Prednisone for Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients
Azacitidine can reverse clinical resistance to docetaxel through upregulation of Growth Arrest and DNA Damage inducible alpha (GADD45α) and other epigenetically regulated genes.

Duration of Response, Length of time from the date of first observation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the date of first observation of disease progression, according to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 1 (PCWG1) criteria. PSA response according to PCWG1 is defined as an least 50 percent decline in PSA level from baseline that was maintained for at least three weeks., Up to 4.5 years.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from the date of start of treatment until the first documented or confirmed disease progression, or death related to prostate cancer, whichever is earlier., Up to 4.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of initiation of study treatment until date of death from any cause., Up to 4.5 years.|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events After Beginning Protocol Therapy., Up to 4.5 years
Study design A phase I/II clinical trial in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

Primary objective phase I component of study:

To determine a safe and potentially efficacious phase II dose of azacitidine in combination with docetaxel and prednisone that can be used for the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

Primary objective phase II component of study:

To determine the therapeutic efficacy of combined therapy of azacitidine, docetaxel, and prednisone, in the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. The primary measure of therapeutic efficacy is response, defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, complete response (CR), or partial response (PR).

Secondary endpoints are toxicity, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
