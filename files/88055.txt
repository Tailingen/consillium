Ibrutinib, Fludarabine, and Pembrolizumab in High-Risk or Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Background:

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby referred as CLL) are tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has a poor clinical outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. This single-arm, phase II study investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for treatment of CLL. Ibrutinib is an orally administered therapy for CLL. Fludarabine is a well-tolerated drug that has been widely used to treat CLL. Also, fludarabine can modulate CLL cells as well as immune cells that support the growth of CLL cells. Pembrolizumab recruits immune cells to attack CLL cells. With this approach we hope to achieve a greater reduction in CLL cells than with single agent ibrutinib and to restore healthier immune system that could contribute to durable responses.

Objective:

To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and pembrolizumab.

Eligibility:

Patients with active CLL meeting treatment indications defined by 2008 International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) consensus guideline.

High-risk CLL defined by one of the following:

* Relapsed/refractory disease status, or
* Presence of high-risk mutations regardless of prior treatment status: deletion 17p, TP53 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, SF3B1 mutation, MYC aberration, or complex cytogenetics.

Design:

This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study.

Timeline: Treatment on this study is given in cycles from cycle -3 to 17, then in months beyond cycle 17. Cycles -3 to -1 are 28-day cycles. Cycles 1 to 17 are 21-day cycles. After completion of 1 year of pembrolizumab, the time on study is by chronological months on study from starting pembrolizumab.

Treatment plan:

* Ibrutinib is given starting from cycle -3 and continuously until disease progression or intolerable side effects occur.
* Fludarabine is given on D1-D5 on cycle -2 only
* Pembrolizumab is given every 3 weeks starting from cycle 1 for 1 year.
* Minimal residual disease will be measured at 2 years from cycle 1 to determine the need for long- term treatment with ibrutinib.

  * Previously-untreated patients who achieve minimal residual disease negativity will stop ibrutinib.
  * Patients who do not achieve minimal residual disease negativity or who has Relapsed/refractory CLL will continue ibrutinib.

Background:

This study investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for treatment of CLL. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby referred as CLL) are tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has a poor clinical outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. High-risk CLL is defined by relapsed/refractory disease status, or the presence of high-risk mutations, such as deletion 17p, TP53, and NOTCH1. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies have indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and survive because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL cells benefit from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.

The stimulation through the BCR can be blocked by ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that selectively inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease. Ibrutinib has gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL regardless of prior treatment or cytogenetic status. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does not eliminate all tumor cells and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant. Therefore, combination of ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial.
