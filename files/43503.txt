QUILT-3.031: AMG 337 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Clear Cell Sarcoma
This is a phase 2 study that will assess the efficacy of AMG 337 in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear cell sarcoma that contains the EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion.
Clear Cell Sarcoma
DRUG: AMG 337
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety And Tolerability), To evaluate the safety of AMG 337 based on grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity., 1 year
The phase 2 single arm study will assess efficacy of AMG 337 (based on confirmed ORR) in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear cell sarcoma that contains the EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion, as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or other diagnostic methods and confirmed by RNA sequencing (RNAseq).
