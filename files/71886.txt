Head to Head Pilot Trial of Mailed Cologuard to Mailed FIT
The objective of this pilot study is to compare the effectiveness of mailed outreach of two stool based tests, Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) in screening eligible adults ages 45-49 receiving care at the University of California San Diego Health system.
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cologuard|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fecal Immunochemical Test
Proportion of Colorectal cancer screening completion, The proportion of individuals who complete any colorectal cancer screening test recommended by US Preventive Services Task Force (colonoscopy, FIT, Cologuard, Sigmoidoscopy or CT Colonography), Within 3 months of randomization|Proportion of Abnormal stool blood test results, Among those completing designed interventions (Cologuard or FIT), the proportion of test results yielding an abnormal result., Within 3 months of randomization|Proportion of Follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal stool blood test result, Among those with positive stool blood test results, the proportion who complete diagnostic follow-up colonoscopy, Within 6 months after stool blood test completion
Number of participants opting out of the pilot, Measurement of feasibility of pilot, Within 3 months of randomization|Number of participants with undeliverable FIT or Cologuard tests (mail fail rate), Measurement of feasibility of mailed outreach, Within 3 months of randomization|Number of Adenomas detected, Measurement of number of adenomas detected during study period, Within 6 months after screening test completion|Number of sessile serrated lesions detected, Measurement of number of sessile serrated lesions detected during study period, Within 6 months after screening test completion|Number of colorectal cancer cases detected, Number of colorectal cancers detected during study period, Within 6 months after screening test completion
Adults ages 45-49 who are insured, deemed average risk and not currently up to date with colorectal cancer screening will be enrolled. Eligible participants will be randomized to either mailed Cologuard outreach, facilitated by Exact Sciences or mailed FIT outreach. Colorectal cancer screening completion within 3 months will be measured as the primary outcome, in addition to secondary recruitment and intervention-based feasibility outcomes to demonstrate the potential for a larger randomized controlled trial.
