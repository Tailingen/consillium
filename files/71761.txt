Efficacy & Safety Study of Lorlatinib in ALK/ROS1 Metastatic NSCLC Patients With Compassionate Use Treatment
This is an observational, non-interventional, retrospective, multicentre and nationwide study. The information will be obtained retrospectively, in most cases when the treatment has already ended.

The primary objective of this study is determine the activity of lorlatinib (percentage of responses, duration of response, progression-free survival and time to treatment failure) of patients included in the compassionate use program in Spain.
Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Lorlatinib
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival defined as time from the first dose of lorlatinib to the first documentation of progression or death from any cause., From date of the first dose of lorlatinib treatment until the date of last follow up or death, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of the response, Duration of the response defined from the first documentation of tumor response to the first documentation of tumor progression or death from any cause., From date of the first dose of lorlatinib treatment until the date of last follow up or death, assessed up to 60 months|Time to treatment failure, Time to treatment failure defined as time from the first dose of lorlatinib to the moment of discontinuation of treatment for any cause, including tumor progression, toxicity or death, From date of the first dose of lorlatinib treatment until the date of last follow up or death, assessed up to 60 months
Overall survival of ALK and ROS1 NSCLC patients, Overall survival of ALK and ROS1 NSCLC patients from lorlatinib defined as time from the start of treatment until death or last follow-up, From date of the first dose of lorlatinib treatment until the date of last follow up or death, assessed up to 60 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Occurrence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria., From date of the first dose of lorlatinib treatment until the date of last follow up or death,assessed up to 60 months
This is an observational, non-interventional, retrospective, multicentre and nationwide study. The information will be obtained retrospectively, in most cases when the treatment has already ended. In cases where the patient continues on the treatment, the researcher will not modify the clinical management of the patient by participating in the study.

Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with lorlatinib who were included in the compassionate use program in Spain between November 2016 and February 2019 for those with an ALK alteration, and between November 2016 to March 2021 for those with ROS1 alteration. According to the records of the Spanish centres participating in this program, approximately 145 patients have been included.

The primary objective of this study is determine the activity of lorlatinib (percentage of responses, duration of response, progression-free survival and time to treatment failure) of patients included in the compassionate use program in Spain.
