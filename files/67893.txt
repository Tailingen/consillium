A Phase II Neoadjuvant Study of Darolutamide Plus ADT in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer
Scientific Rationale: High risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with higher rates of biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence, metastasis and PCa-specific death. Novel hormone therapies(NHT) have shown a significant survival advantage with respect to classical ADT in later stages of PCa and have already been investigated in neoadjuvant setting.

PURPOSE: To assess antitumor effect by measuring pathological tumor volume with pathological downstaging following radical prostatectomy + pelvic lymph-node dissection (RP + PLND) for high-risk localized prostate cancer patients.

pCR or MRD, Pathologic complete response or Minimal Residual Disease(defined as overall diameter \<5 mm), 6 months|PSM, Percentage of patients with positive surgical margins, 6 months|Rate of peri-operative complications, including delay in surgery, intra-operative complications, and postoperative complications, within 30 days of surgery|Biochemical complete response, PSA \<0.1ng/ml prior to RP, 6 months|PSA undetectable rate, PSA\<0.02 ng/ml, 12 months post-RP|2-year biochemical progression-free survival, bPFS, PSA\>0.2 ng/ml, 24 months post-RP|AEs/SAEs, The level of AEs defined by NCI-CTCAE v5.0. Safety assessments will be assessed and documented after initiation of study drug, regardless of relationship to study drug., Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antitumor treatment, whichever occurred first
