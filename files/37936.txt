Study of Prophylactic Octreotide to Prevent or Reduce the Frequency and Severity of Diarrhoea in Subjects Receiving Lapatinib With Capecitabine for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer
Diarrhoea is the most commonly reported adverse event (AE) associated with Lapatinib treatment, and is also commonly associated with Capecitabine treatment. Although these events are generally mild to moderate in severity, diarrhoea adversely affects the tolerability of cancer treatment, and in severe cases diarrhoea has the potential to affect the efficacy of treatment due to poor compliance, or treatment interruption or withdrawal. The efficacy of Octreotide in the management of cancer treatment-associated diarrhoea has not been extensively evaluated in large, well-controlled studies. This is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer which has progressed following prior therapy, which must have included anthracyclines and taxanes and therapy with Trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. This study is not placebo controlled, and there is no active comparator. The study evaluates whether the prophylactic use of Octreotide Long Acting Release (LAR) offers a clinically meaningful benefit by reducing the frequency and severity of diarrhoea associated with treatment with Lapatinib and Capecitabine. Study completion for a subject is defined as the completion of 24 weeks of treatment with Lapatinib and Capecitabine, or progression of cancer or the death of the subject during treatment, whichever occurs first. Approximately 140 subjects were planned to be randomized out of which 70 were planned to receive octreotide and 70 were planned to receive no Octreotide.
