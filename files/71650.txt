Study of the SG001 Injection for Patients With Relapsed or Metastatic Uterine Cervical Cancer
This study is an open, single-arm, multicenter phase II study to investigate the efficacy and safety of SG001 for relapsed or metastatic uterine cervical cancer patients with PD-L1 positive (CPSâ‰§1), and has failed at least first line platinum-based chemotherapy.
