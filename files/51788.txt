Phase I Study of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
BACKGROUND:

-This study represents a progression from findings in four previous National Cancer Institute (NCI) Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) protocols (02-C-0167A, 02-C-0207E, 03-C-0190B, 04-C-0171). In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain magnetic resonance (MR) biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients.

OBJECTIVES:

-The scientific objective of this protocol is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of external beam radiation to regions of interest within the prostate based acute toxicity.

Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity.

ELIGIBILITY:

-Patients with prostate cancer without evidence of metastasis will be eligible for this study.

DESIGN:

* This phase I trial will use intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to deliver escalating doses of external beam radiation to regions of histologically confirmed prostate cancer. The study will be conducted using a standard 3-6 dose-escalation with an initial 3 patients in each dose cohort and the potential expansion of the cohort to 6 patients.
* Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (MR) biological images, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), will be obtained. Tissue will be acquired from sites of interest, with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an MR image of reference. Tissue samples will be processed for complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the Radiation Oncology Branch, NCI. A gold seed will be left at the biopsy site as a fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy. If necessary, additional fiducial markers will be placed for target localization during treatment.
* Once MR guided biopsies are obtained and fiducial markers placed, the patient will undergo a standard computed tomography (CT) simulation for radiation therapy treatment planning. The MR and CT images will be fused. Areas of pathologically confirmed malignancy will undergo dose escalation as described below. Areas of image abnormality that could not be biopsied or were without definite pathologic evidence of malignancy will be given intermediate doses. The remainder of the prostate gland will receive standard dose (7560 centigray (cGy)').
* The trial will accrue 18 to 36 patients with an anticipated accrual period of 2 years.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of External Beam Radiation, Maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 or more in a cohort of either 3 or 6 patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity attributed to radiation therapy., 12 weeks after radiation therapy (RT)
Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTC v3.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., 53 months and 20 days
Radiation Response With Genomic and Proteomic Analyses, Genomic and proteomic analyses will be conducted on a gene by gene basis using a 2-sample t-test at the 0.001 level and correlated with radiation response., completion of therapy|Correlate Toxicity With Genomic and Proteomic Analyses, Genomic and proteomic analyses will be conducted on a gene by gene basis using a 2-sample t-test at the 0.001 level and correlated with toxicity., Completion of therapy|Long-term Effects and Toxicity Following Selective Intra-prostatic Dose Escalation, Acute and late toxicity will be assessed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Acute and Late Toxicity Genitourinary (GI)/Gastrointestinal (GU) scales., completion of therapy
