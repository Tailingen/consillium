Vinorelbine/Carboplatin Versus Gemcitabine/Carboplatin in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Development of an active second-line treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients previously pre-treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative settings. For each randomisation arm, 100 patients will be included. The trial was performed as a 2-stage phase II study according to the optimal design by Simon with overall response rate as the primary objective.

Study Design:

Arm A: Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1,8; Carboplatin AUC=6 d1 q 3 weeks; Arm B: Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1,8; Carboplatin AUC=6 d1 q 3 weeks;
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival, Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unaccettable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assested up to 30 months
Overall Survival, Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unaccettable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assested up to 30 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unaccettable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assested up to 30 months|Duration of response, Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unaccettable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assested up to 30 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Safety of treatment will be evaluated by the frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events, clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status(PS). All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment will be included in the safety analysis., Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unaccettable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assested up to 30 months
