Safety and Efficacy Study of Gene Therapy Drug (Neovasculgen) to Treat Secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon
The purpose of this study is to determine whether pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) is effective in the treatment of digital ulcers related to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon associated with systemic scleroderma
Secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon
DRUG: Neovasculgen
Frequency of new digital ulcers, To determine the ability of pl-vegf165 to prevent development of new digital ulcers the frequency of new digital ulcers will be measured in both groups and then compared, 180 days|Frequency of adverse events, 180 days
Time of complete healing of digital ulcers, The ability of pl-vegf165 to accelerate the healing of the digital ulcer will be measured by estimating the area of the defect in progress, 180 days|Pain scores on the visual analog scale, Visual analog scale is a diagnostic tool providing an assessment of the severity and quality of pain experienced by patients., 180 days
This is a randomized, open, comparing clinical trial assessing the therapeutic efficacy of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in treating scleroderma-associated Raynaud's syndrome. Each patient of clinical group will undergo several intramuscular injections with a treatment dose of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in hand where digital ulcers locate. In the control group patients will receive only standard of care without gene therapy drug.

Study participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy. After this initial assessment, the patients of clinical group will undergo intramuscular injections of pl-vegf165 (Neovasculgen) in a hand altered with digital ulcers.

Patient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the six month study period. At three month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy. At six months post-injection, the patient will again complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive capillaroscopy.
