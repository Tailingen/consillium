TACE Plus Axitinib and Hydroxychlorquine for Liver-Dominant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
Liver metastases are a leading cause of death among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Duration of disease control is short following 2nd-line or later systemic therapy. Liver-directed therapy such as TACE has a higher response rate and improves progression-free survival (PFS), but the benefit is still limited. Cancer cells escape ischemic cell death via autophagy and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activation. We hypothesize that blocking autophagy and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway will improve both response and PFS following TACE.

Subjects with liver-dominant colorectal cancer metastases failing at least one line of systemic therapy will receive 2 weeks of axitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) and HCQ 600 mg BID followed by lobar or segmental TACE monthly until the entire tumor burden is treated, then continue axitinib/HCQ until progression or intolerable toxicity. Response and hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS) will be assessed one month post-TACE, then every 3 months.
