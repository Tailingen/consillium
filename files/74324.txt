Evaluating Dyspnea in Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis "why Am I Short of Breath?"
Individuals with MG (IwMG) experience shortness of breath that may be activity-related, occur at rest and even happen during sleep. Dyspnea is a complex, multidimensional and multifactorial symptom involving sensory perception, cognition and emotion. Identifying the cause(s) of dyspnea in MG may assist in finding therapeutic strategies, reducing discomfort, improving QoL and potentially limiting respiratory deterioration and incidence of MG crisis.

MYaResp is a prospective observational, cross-sectional study to evaluate dyspnea in adults with autoimmune myasthenia gravis.

Study aims include to:

* Describe the characteristics of dyspnea in IwMG
* Understand contributing factors and factors associated with dyspnea in IwMG including the relationship between patient-reported dyspnea, disease severity and functional limitations.
* Determine the most effective tests to identify the causes and contributing factors of dyspnea
