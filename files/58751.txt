Clinical Feasibility of Mobile App-Based Self-Management for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
The study evaluates a newly developed service that provides personalized self-management guidance based on evidence-based arm circumference measurements and resulting volume changes. The research aims to determine whether this digital solution is practical and acceptable for patients while identifying any unexpected challenges during implementation, ultimately establishing its potential for clinical integration into lymphedema care.

Function, appearance, symptoms, and mood are rated on a 1-4 scale where lower scores indicate better quality of life, while quality of life is rated on a 0-10 scale where higher scores indicate better quality of life, Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|EQ-5D-5L, Full Title: EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level Objective: quality of life Scoring System: Each item is evaluated on a 5-point scale and weighted according to the country. EQ VAS evaluates data on a scale of 0-100, with a higher score indicating better health., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|self-efficacy, Full Title: lymphedema-specific exercise barriers self-efficacy A. Composed of 9 general exercise barriers and 5 lymphedema-related barrier items B. Evaluates how confident one feels about exercising in each situation on a scale from 0% (not confident at all) to 100% (extremely confident) with 10% intervals C. Interpreted as '0-20%=not confident at all, 20-40%=slightly confident, 40-60%=moderately confident, 60-80%=very confident, 80-100%=extremely confident', Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|upper arm use, Self-developed questionnaire A. Level of self-awareness of edema, amount of affected arm use, anxiety about using the affected arm B. Level of self-awareness of edema: 2 items, 0 (not at all) - 10 (very much) scale C. Amount of affected arm use: 1 item, change in arm usage on a -5 to 5 scale D. Anxiety about using the affected arm: 1 item, change in anxiety about arm use on a -5 to 5 scale, Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health), Objective: function, activity and participant, environment Scoring System: A. Assess the 8 items of body functions, 8 items of activities and participation, and 8 items of environmental factors of the breast cancer ICF core set brief B. Body functions are assessed as 0 (no problems) - 4 (extreme problems), 9 (not applicable). Activities and participation are assessed as 0 (no difficulties) - 4 (extreme difficulties), 9 (not applicable). Environment is assessed as 0 (no barriers) - 4 (extreme barriers), +0 (no facilitating factors) - +4 (complete facilitating factors), 9 (not applicable)., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|COPM, Full Title: Canadian Occupational Performance Measure A. A client-centered assessment that identifies and prioritizes everyday problems that limit an individual's participation in daily life across all areas, including self-management, productive activities, and leisure B. Performance and satisfaction for activities selected as important issues are evaluated on a 0-10 scale C. Clinically significant change = 2-point change, Baseline, Month 3, Month 6|Smart Measuring Tape, Upper Limb Circumference Measurement, Baseline, Month 3|Perometer, Optoelectronic Limb Volumeter (Perometer) Upper Limb Volume Measurement, Baseline, Month 3, Month 6
