Cross-linked Hyaluronan Gel Reduces Rectal Toxicity Due to Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to determine if cross-linked hyaluronan gel reduces the dose of radiation delivered to the rectum and the rectal toxicity of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Cross-linked hyaluronan gel
Mean rectal dose without Hylaform vs with Hylaform, 8 months
Severity of late diarrhea without Hylaform vs with Hylaform, 33 months|Rectal wall relative V60 and V70 without Hylaform vs with Hylaform, 8 months|Severity of acute diarrhea during IMRT without Hylaform vs with Hylaform, 8 months
The main risk associated with transperineal injection of cross-linked hyaluronan gel into the anterior perirectal fat is infection. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given, resulting in a \<5% risk. Another possible risk (\<5%) is an allergic reaction such as itching. Patients who are allergic to avian products will be excluded from the study. Tenderness and pain at the injection site are possible. Bleeding, bruising, redness, or discoloration or the formation of a bump (granuloma) or scar (keloid) at the injection site is also possible. Embolization of cross-linked hyaluronan gel through the blood is a potential, rare complication if the gel is injected into a blood vessel rather than into fat. Prada et al. did not see any side effects related to the injection or the material itself in 27 patients based on a mean follow-up of 13 months (range: 9-22 months). Patients did not complain of pain, tenesmus, rectal pressure, or a sensation of rectal filling. Risks beyond 22 months are not well defined. Potential benefits of cross-linked hyaluronan gel include fewer rectal complications due to radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer.
