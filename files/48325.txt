An Expanded Access Study to Provide at Home Subcutaneous Administration of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab Fixed-Dose Combination (PH FDC SC) for Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic
This single arm, multicenter study provides the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination formulation for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) administered at home by a home health nursing provider for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer who have completed concurrent chemotherapy with pertuzumab (Perjeta) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) by intravenous administration (P+H IV) and are currently receiving or will be receiving maintenance therapy with P+H IV, PH FDC SC, or trastuzumab SC in the clinic. The main objective is to enable continuity of care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study will enroll approximately 200 patients in the United States.

Participants with early or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be enrolled in this study. Participants with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will receive treatment every 3 weeks and continue treatment unless early cessation is necessary due to disease recurrence, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant withdrawal of consent, or per physician's recommendation. Participants with early HER2+ breast cancer will receive PH FDC SC to complete 1 year (up to 18 cycles) of dual blockade, including the P+H IV, PH FDC SC, or trastuzumab SC they received prior to enrolling in this study, unless early cessation is necessary due to disease recurrence, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant withdrawal of consent, or per physician's recommendation.

A remote cardiac surveillance substudy will be optional for patients enrolled at select sites.

The Sponsor may decide to terminate the study when the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a risk for this patient population.
