Axumin PETMRI Imaging Following Focal Cryo-ablation (FCA)
This is a prospective outcomes study assessing quality of life and oncological control at pre-defined time points following FOCAL CRYO-ABLATION (FCA). The investigator's standard of care is to perform an Magentic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and prostate biopsy two years following FCA. The prostate biopsy assesses both the presence of in field and out of field disease. The role of Axumin PET/MRI for detecting disease following FCA has not been previously examined.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Standard of Care MRI|OTHER: Fluciclovine PET scan added to MRI
Measure of sensitivity following PET imaging with 18-F fluciclovine (Axumin), 1 Day
The primary hypothesis of this study is that 18F-Fluciclovine PET/MRI imaging at two years following FCA will improve sensitivity for detection of in field recurrence of significant prostate cancer defined as any Gleason pattern 4 disease.

The secondary hypothesis of this study is that 18F-Fluciclovine PET/MRI imaging at two years following FCA will improve sensitivity for detection of out of field recurrence of significant prostate cancer .
