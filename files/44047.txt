TCR Alpha/Beta and CD19-deplete Haplo-HSCT
This is an open label, interventional, non-randomized, phase II trial of TCR alpha/beta and CD19-depeleted allogeneic HCT in pediatric patients with hematologic disease.

This is a single-site, open label, interventional, non-randomized, phase II trial of TCRαβ/CD19 deplete allogeneic HCT as donor source and sole GVHD prophylaxis in pediatric patients with either malignant or non-malignant hematologic disease who are eligable for allogeneic HCT, but lack a HLA-matched sibling donor.
