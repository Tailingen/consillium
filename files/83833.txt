Dose Finding, Safety and Tolerability Study for AC220 to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors
AC220 will be administered as a once daily oral solution given continuously as 28-day treatment cycles, without food and without any rest periods, as long as there is no evidence of disease progression or unacceptably severe adverse events (AEs) related to the study drug.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Compound AC220
Safety and tolerability of AC220 given once daily without food continuously for 28 days (1 cycle) to patients with advanced solid tumors., Repeatedly measured at multiple timepoints during 1st cycle; every 2 weeks thereafter
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of AC220 in this patient population under the conditions of the study, including a careful and detailed evaluation of the ECG effects of AC220 in relation to plasma drug concentration, Repeatedly measured at multiple timepoints during the first cycle of treament.|Preliminary evidence of antitumor biology or clinical activity of AC220 in patients enriched for diseases whose pathophysiology is directly related to aberrant c-KIT receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling., Measured every 28 days (per treatment cycle)
A phase 1 open-label, dose finding study of AC220 in patients with solid tumors.
