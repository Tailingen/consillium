Phase I Cabazitaxel, Mitoxantrone, and Prednisone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone, and prednisone (CAMP) in combination at different dose levels and to determine the highest dose that does not cause bad side effects. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, CAMP has on patients and their metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of cabazitaxel and mitoxantrone/prednisone as chemotherapy for patients with metastatic CRPC who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease., Participants will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 4 months.
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity recorded., Participants will have AE/Toxicity evaluations every 21 days. Average study participation is approximately 4 months.|Reduction in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), of the combination of cabazitaxel and mitoxantrone/prednisone in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease., Participants will have PSA assessments every 21 days. Average study participation is approximately 4 months.|Efficacy of drug combination including objective response rate and duration of response, Participants will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 4 months.
This is a Phase I, open label, dose-finding, multicenter clinical trial to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 IV q21 days) in combination with mitoxantrone (4-12 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg orally BID) in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Up to five cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination. An accelerated titration design method is being used in order to minimize the number of patients exposed to subtherapeutic doses of mitoxantrone.
