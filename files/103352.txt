A Study in Participants Previously Enrolled in a Genentech- and/or F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd-Sponsored Atezolizumab Study (IMbrella A)
This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized extension and long-term observational study. Participants receiving atezolizumab monotherapy or atezolizumab combined with other agent(s) or comparator agent(s) in a Genentech or Roche-sponsored study (the parent study) and who continue to receive study treatment at the time of the parent-study closure and do not have access to the study treatment locally are eligible for continued treatment in the extension study. Dosing regimen for a given participant and indication will be the same or equivalent to the respective parent study protocol. Study treatment in the extension study can continue until disease progression or beyond if the patient continues to derive clinical benefit as judged by the investigator and if allowed by the parent study or local prescribing information until death; withdrawal of study consent; unacceptable toxicity; pregnancy; patient non-compliance; or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.
