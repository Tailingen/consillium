EXplanted LIver and Ex-vivo Pancreatic Specimen Evaluation by 7 TESLA MRI
Aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the characteristics detected by the 7T MRI equipment and the histological composition of native explanted livers (group A), liver graft excluded for donation (group B) and surgical specimens of primary pancreatic tumour, which underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (group C).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 7T Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Evaluate the correlation between the characteristics detected by the MRI equipment and the histological composition of ex-vivo specimens from hepatic and pancreatic tissues and lesions, The creation of a data-bank will increase the knowledge about imaging features able to characterize many diseases affecting the liver, and to evaluate cell changes that occur in pancreatic cancer and the tumour pathways of spreading; moreover it will provide a reference framework to define proper acquisition protocols for future clinical applications.

Such data will also provide imaging biomarkers of malignant cells, and show the morphological changes that occur in neoplastic lesions after systemic or loco-regional therapies., 3 years
