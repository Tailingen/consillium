A Study for Older Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
The NCRI Adult ALL sub-group propose to collaborate with the Dutch/Belgian group HOVON to carry out a prospective, non randomised multi-arm study (including a choice of regimen intensity) to investigate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a standardised therapy protocol for patients â‰¥ 60 years old with de novo ALL. The overall aim is define a basic standard of care upon which trials of novel therapies will be based in future. The design of the study will enable collection of a comprehensive dataset regarding the clinical outcome, Complete Response Rate (CR) and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) response rates in a previously completely uncharacterised population, thus providing the essential platform for designing future randomised advanced phase studies in which new therapeutic approaches and novel therapies can be prospectively investigated.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
DRUG: Chemotherapy
Complete remission rate after 2 phases of induction, All patients will be assessed for their remission status at the end of Phase 2 induction. The CR rate at this timepoint will then be calculated., Approximately 2 months after start of treatment
Complete remission rate after 1 phase of induction, All patients will be assessed for their remission status at the end of Phase 1 induction. The CR rate at this timepoint will then be calculated., Approximately 1 month after start of treatment|Overall Survival at 1 year, Overall survival for all patients will be measured 1 year after registration, 1 year after registration|Prognostic significance of molecularly determined minimal residual disease (MRD) at various time-points during therapy with respect to relapse occurrence., MRD levels will be measured at distinct timepoints during the trial., At diagnosis, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks after starting treatment|Tolerability of treatment as determined by occurrence of key adverse effects, Patients in arms A-D will be assessed for adverse events at distinct timepoints during the trial, Approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks after starting treatment|Duration of in-patient hospitalisation, All patients will be assessed for the number of days they have spent as in-patients at distinct timepoints during the trial., Approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 28 after starting treatment and every 3 months during maintenance|Relationship between performance status/co-morbidity and treatment option chosen, At registration|Quality of life aspects assessed at diagnosis/baseline at various time points, Registration, Approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 28 after starting treatment, before starting maintenance and at the end of maintenance
The study will

1. establish baseline expectations for Event Free Survival (EFS), Overall Survival (OS), MRD responses and quality of life measures for older patients of all ages and pre-morbid states;
2. disclose how best to use knowledge of pre-morbid characteristics to apply the appropriate intensity of therapy in order to balance the best disease related outcomes against quality of life;
3. establish national standards of care for this patient group;
4. provide the essential platform for careful design of future randomised advanced phase studies of new therapeutic approaches and agents.
