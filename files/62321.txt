GVM±R in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive NHL
This is a prospective, dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GVM±R in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma

Dose limited toxicities (DLTs), adverse events (AE) defined as DLT events per protocol, Through the last patient complete his DLT observation, assessed up to 21 days|The incidence rates of AE and SAE, AE or severe adverse events (SAE) occur since the first dose of therapy is given, up to 28 days after the last patient complete his study therapy|Objective response rate (ORR), Response is assessed according to the lugano criteria, up to 2 years|Complete response rate (CRR), Response is assessed according to the lugano criteria, : up to 2 years|progression-free survival（PFS）, From the date of the first dose of therapy is given until disease progression, death or last follow-up, up to 2 years
This is a single-arm, single-center, dose-escalation clinical study to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride when combined with gemcitabine, vinorelbine and/or rituximab (GVM ± R) in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be given on day 1 at four different doses (16 mg/m2, 18 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2,22 mg/m2) and be combined with gemcitabine, vinorelbine and/or rituximab (rituximab only in CD20+ lymphoma). The dose limited toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first cycle of therapy. A maximum of 6 cycles of therapy are planned.
