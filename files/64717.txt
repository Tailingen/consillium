Feasibility Study for the Determination of Oxysterols in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Hormonal Therapy With Tamoxifen or Not
This is a biomedical study of interventional type which includes 29 patients on 9 months: 8 months recruiting and 1 month follow up.

Patients with hormone dependent breast cancer metastatic or non-metastatic, for which an indication of hormonal therapy treatment (with tamoxifen or anti-aromatase) is retained, will be enrolled in this study.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility for the determination of Oxysterols (CT, CE, OCDO) in this patient population, before and after the initiation of treatment (ie, at D0 before and D28 after beginning of treatment).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tamoxifen,|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Letrozole
Determination of Oxysterols (OCDO, CT and CE)plasma concentrations by Gaz Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS)in human., Oxysterols measured are the following : OCDO (6-oxo-cholestan-3 beta, 5 alpha-diol), CE (cholesterol-5,6-eposides) and CT (cholestane-3 beta, 5 alpha, 6 beta-triol).

Calibration curve will be established for each Oxysterol by GC/MS using deuterated analogues of each oxysterols for the quantification., 2 time points (D0 and D28) over a period of 2 years
Measure of Oxysterols (OCDO, CT and CE) plasma concentrations in patient treated with Tamoxifen, Plasma concentrations of Oxysterols evaluated by Gaz chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS)in patients after 28 days of hormonal therapy with Tamoxifen in order to determine the impact of the treatment on these plasmatic concentrations(D28 oxysterols plasma concentrations will be compared to D0 oxysterols plasma concentrations), 2 time points (D0 and D28) over a period of 2 years|Measure of Oxysterols (OCDO, CT and CE) plasma concentrations in patient treated with anti-aromatase., Plasma concentrations of Oxysterols evaluated by Gaz chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS)in patients after 28 days of hormonal therapy with anti-aromatase (Anastrozole, Letrozole or Exemestane) in order to determine the absence of impact of the treatment on these plasmatic concentrations (D28 oxysterols plasma concentrations will be compared to D0 oxysterols plasma concentrations)., 2 time points (D0 and D28) over a period of 2 years
