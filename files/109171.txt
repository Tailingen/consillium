Detection of ARv7 in the Plasma of Men With Advanced Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (MCRP)
Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of MCRPC patients pre and post treatment with selective Androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e. abiraterone and enzalutamide)
Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
Detection of ARv7 splice variant in the circulation of MCRPC patients. PSA response rate in ARv7 positive patients., The detection of ARv7 splice variants in samples will be considered both binary: positive or negative/not assessable and level based. ARv7 splice variants from exosomes will be detectable from baseline in 50% of both API; PSA response rates will be 10% or less in ARv7 positive patients. With a sample of 30 patients (as reported in the NEJM study) per cohort would allow the study to have an 85% power to detect a difference of 50 percentage points in PSA response rates, with the use of a two-sided test at an alpha level of 0.1., Two years

Primary Objective

-Demonstrate detection of ARv7 splice variant transcripts from exosomes in the circulation of MCRPC patients pre and post treatment with selective Androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e. abiraterone and enzalutamide)

Secondary and Exploratory Objectives

* Correlate ARv7 status with PSA response (\>/=50% decline in PSA level from baseline, maintained for \>/=4 weeks) at any time after the initiation of therapy.
* Comparison of median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
* Determine additional molecular lesions in exoRNA and cfDNA in MCRPC patients post-treatment with androgen pathway inhibitors.
* Correlate other AR-variants (non ARv7) with clinical outcomes including PSA response.
