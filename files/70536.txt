A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glumetinib Combined With Osimertinib Mesylate Versus Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients After Resistance to EGFR-TKIs
The is a randomized, controlled, open-label Phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glumetinib combined with osimertinib mesylate versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer( NSCLC) patients with MET amplification and/or overexpression after resistance to EGFR-TKIs..

Approximately 350 NSCLC patients with MET amplification and/or overexpression after previous treatment with EGFR-TKIs are planned to be enrolled. After patients sign the informed consent form (ICF), those who are eligible for enrollment after screening examinations will be randomized to the investigational group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio by the central randomization system (IWRS).
