PET-MRI Assessment of Early Tumor Response to Predict Outcomes of HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancer Patients
This proposal explores the novel hypothesis that the variability in outcomes within the Intermediate Risk(IR) HPV-positive Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma(OPSCC) cohort can be exploited to identify a subpopulation that exhibits outcomes similar to Low Risk (LR) HPV-positive Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma and therefore would be appropriate candidates for radiation dose de-escalation approaches. Current literature using PET, CT, and MRI as single imaging modalities have identified certain criteria within heterogenous patient populations that are associated with clinical outcomes. Here, the investigators will test the hypothesis that multiparametric analysis of simultaneously-acquired MRI and PET quantitative imaging biomarker data from the primary tumor prior to initiating therapy, after 2 weeks of chemoradiation(CRT), and 3 months following completion of chemoradiation in patients with Intermediate Risk HPV-positive Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma will generate parametric maps that are predictive of clinical outcome.

Furthermore, the investigators will collect blood samples prior to, during, and after radiation therapy to evaluate whether levels of detected circulating tumor cells correlate with response to treatment.

Radiographic change in the primary tumor of patients with LR and IR HPV-positive OPSCC using MRI/PET imaging, Patients with LR and IR HPV-positive OPSCC will be segregated into favorable and unfavourable cohorts using radiographic change(MRI/PET) in the primary tumor between pre-treatment and intra-treatment. T-stage, N-stage, and pack-years smoking markers will be used as surrogate markers, Pre-treatment (baseline) and following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Radiographic change in the primary largest pathologic lymph node of patients with LR and IR HPV-positive OPSCC using MRI/PET imaging, Patients with LR and IR HPV-positive OPSCC will be segregated into favorable and unfavourable cohorts using radiographic change(MRI/PET) in the largest pathologic lymph node between pre-treatment and intra-treatment. T-stage, N-stage, and pack-years smoking markers will be used as surrogate markers, Pre-treatment (baseline) and following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)
Progression Free Survival, up to 2 years|Absolute volumetric change of the primary tumor, The primary tumor response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute volumetric change in the tumor following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Absolute metabolic change of the primary tumor, The primary tumor response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute metabolic change in the tumor following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Absolute physiologic change of the primary tumor, The primary tumor response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute physiologic change in the tumor following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Absolute volumetric change of involved nodes, The nodal response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute volumetric change of involved nodes following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Absolute metabolic change of involved nodes, The nodal response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute metabolic change of involved nodes following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)|Absolute physiologic change of involved nodes, The nodal response in patients with LR HPV-positive OPSCC and HPV-negative OPSCC will be measured in terms of absolute physiologic change of involved nodes following 2 weeks of CRT, Following 2-weeks of CRT (approximately 2-3 weeks on study)
