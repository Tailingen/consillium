Impact of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) on Cancer Cells From Liver Metastases of Colon Cancer
Analyze the dynamics of incorporation of 5-fluorouracil into cancer cell ribosomes from liver metastases of patient with metastatic colon cancer.
Cancer of Colon|Metastasis to Liver
PROCEDURE: Scheduled and planned surgery
5-FU in ribosome, Rate of incorporation of 5-fluorouracil into ribosomes of tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues before surgery and after surgery., Up to 24 months
Methylation profile of ribosomal RNAs, Analyze on a large scale the alterations of the 2'-O-methylation profile of ribosomal RNAs before surgery and after surgery, Up to 24 months|Transcriptomic and proteomic profile, Define a transcriptomic and proteomic profile of the collected samples before surgery and after surgery., Up to 24 months|Specific molecular signature, Combination of the number of 5-fluorouracil molecules incorporated per rRNA molecule, the methylation profile and the transcriptomic profile before surgery and after surgery., Up to 24 months
This is a monocentric, prospective, non-interventional cohort study in adult patients with metastatic colon cancer with hepatics metastasis.

Tumour samples collected for this study include:

* A fragment of the previously operated primary tumor: FFIP block and/or archived frozen tumor if available.
* A fragment of the liver metastasis(s) performed as part of standard metastasis surgery, this fragment will include a tumor area and a healthy area within the margin of excision. These samples collected in a fresh state will be analyzed immediately.
