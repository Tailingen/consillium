Concurrently vs Sequentially Combined HAIC With Targeted and Immunotherapy in Potentially Resectable HCC
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare HAIC concurrently with sequentially combined with targeted and immunotherapies in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with potentially resectable intermediate and advanced HCC (CNLC stage IIa\~IIIa). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does a "strong combination" regimen of three simultaneous treatments (HAIC, targeted agents and immunotherapy) definitely result in a higher surgical conversion rate and better survival benefit?
* Can the combination of targeted and immunotherapies based on patients' response to HAIC therapy avoid over-treatment of some patients without affecting the surgical conversion rate and overall survival? Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either HAIC concurrently or sequentially combined with targeted and immunotherapies.

Researchers will compare concurrent treatment group with sequential treatment group to see if there are different in terms of the conversion resection rate, long-term survival, and safety.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Chemotherapy Effect|Chemotherapeutic Toxicity
DRUG: Oxaliplatin,calcium folinic acid, levofolinic acid, 5-FU|DRUG: Concurrent Lenvatinib|DRUG: Concurrent PD-1 antibody|DRUG: Sequential Lenvatinib|DRUG: Sequential PD-1 antibody
OS, Overall survival of the participants, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed at least 36 months
PFS, Progression-free survival of the participants, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed at least 36 months|ORR, Objective response rates, which means the proportion of patients with efficacy assessment of complete response and partial response for the size of intrahepatic target lesions according to mRECIST criteria and RECIST v1.1 criteria respectively., Assessed at the end of Cycle 2 and Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)|DCR, Disease control rates, which means the proportion of patients with efficacy assessment of complete response, partial response and stable disease for the size of intrahepatic target lesions according to mRECIST criteria and RECIST v1.1 criteria respectively., Assessed at the end of Cycle 2 and Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)|CRR, Conversion resection rate refer to the proportion of patients in both groups who actually underwent subsequent surgical resection., This outcome measure will be assessed at the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)|Safety profiles of all participants, Adverse Events and Severe Adverse Events evaluated based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, This outcome measure will be assessed at the end of Cycle 1 to 4(each cycle is 28 days), and every 3 months through study completion, an average of 3 years
Participants in the concurrent treatment group will receive two cycles of HAIC (the drugs are oxaliplatin 135mg/m2 over 3hrs, calcium folinic acid 400mg/m2 or levofolinic acid 200mg/ m2 over 1.5hrs, 5-FU 400mg/m2 over 2hrs, 5-FU 2400mg/m2 over 46hrs,every 4 weeks) in combination with targeted drug (lenvatinib 8mg/day) and immunotherapy (PD-1 antibody, dosage and frequency according to instructions), then evaluate the response of tumor, those who achieve complete response (CR) will receive surgical resection or follow-up, those with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) continue two cycles of combined therapy, and those with progress disease (PD) will be withdrawn and receive other treatments. After four cycles of combined therapy, second evaluation of efficacy will be performed, those who achieve CR will receive surgical resection or follow-up observation, and the other patients will be evaluated for the possibility of surgical resection or the subsequent treatment.

Participants in the sequential treatment group will receive two cycles of HAIC (drugs of oxaliplatin 135 mg/m2 over 3 hours; calcium folinic acid 400 mg/m2 or levofolinic acid 200 mg/m2 over 1. 5 hours, 5-FU 400 mg/m2 over 2 hours, and 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 over 46 hours,every 4 weeks), then evaluate the response of tumor, and those who achieve complete response (CR ) will receive surgical resection or follow-up, while other patients continue to receive two cycles of combination therapy, i.e. HAIC combined with targeted drug (levatinib 8mg/day) and immunotherapy (PD-1 antibody, dose and frequency according to instructions). After four cycles, a second efficacy assessment will be performed, and patients who achieve CR will undergo surgical resection or follow-up observation, and the other patients will be evaluated for the possibility of surgical resection or the subsequent treatment.
