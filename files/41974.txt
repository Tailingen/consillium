Study of the Mass Balance of Oral FTD and TPI as Components of TAS-102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients with advanced solid tumors, the mass balance of FTD and TPI after a single dose of TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of \[14C\]FTD or \[14C\]TPI.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of [14C]FTD|DRUG: TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of [14C] TPI|DRUG: TAS-102 tablets
Urinary, fecal, and respiratory excretion of 14C from FTD and urinary and fecal excretion of 14C from TPI, Urine and feces samples will be collected at 24-hour intervals through 168 hours postdose. For \[14C\]FTD only, samples of CO2 will be trapped from expired air immediately prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours postdose., Day 1 through day 8 (through 168 hours postdose)|PK parameters of total radioactivity (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2) in whole blood and plasma after a single dose of TAS-102, Blood will be collected immediately prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours postdose|Metabolic profile of FTD and TPI in plasma, urine, and feces, Characterization of FTD and TPI metabolites, Blood will be collected immediately prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours postdose. Urine and feces samples will be collected at 24-hour intervals through 168 hours postdose.|PK parameters of FTD, FTY, and TPI in plasma (Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, T1/2, CL/F, and Vd/F), Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2 will be calculated for each analyte, and CL/F and Vd/F will be calculated for FTD and TPI, Blood will be collected immediately prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours postdose.
Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Standard safety monitoring and grading using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used, Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever comes first|Tumor assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Every 8 weeks during the extension phase through Cycle 6 (through 24 weeks) and at least every 12 weeks thereafter, until treatment discontinuation (ie, due to disease progression, AEs, patient death, physician decision, pregnancy, or patient request)
This is a Phase 1, open-label study evaluating the mass balance of FTD and TPI after a single dose of TAS-102 with a light tracer dose of \[14C\]FTD or \[14C\]TPI. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: mass balance part and TAS-102 extension part. After completion of the mass balance part, patients will receive continued treatment with TAS-102 during the study extension part.
