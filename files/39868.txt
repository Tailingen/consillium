Determining the Mechanisms of Loss of CAR T Cell Persistence
A prospective observational study of pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients treated with CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T cells). The study will examine changes in CAR-T persistence over time and causal factors.

Time to circulating CAR-T cell loss, CAR-T persistence will be measured in the central lab from blood samples., Through study completion, until the last patient reaches 1 year post-infusion
