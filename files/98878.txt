A Dose Escalation Study of SHP2 Inhibitor in Patients With Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS of EGFR Mutations
A Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of HBI-2376 and characterize its pharmacokinetic profile.

A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose Escalation of HBI-2376 in Patients with Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS or EGFR Mutations. The primary and secondary objectives are:

1. To determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), of HBI-2376 as an oral monotherapy for advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations
2. To characterize the PK of HBI-2376 in subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations

HBI-2376 is a SHP2 Inhibitor and will be dosed once daily throughout the escalation and expansion phase. Up to 42 subjects will be enrolled sequentially into the 3+3 dose escalation and monitored throughout the study for safety and tolerability. The dose escalation phase will consist of 6 cohorts, with doses ranging from 6 to 40mg. Once the MTD of RP2D is established, additional 6 subjects will be enrolled into the expansion phase at that dose level.
