Clinical Value of Left Colic Artery in Laparoscopic Radical Rectectomy
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common tumors in Asia. According to the recent research, surgical procedure could provide more treatment benefit in rectal cancer. Therefore, it was consider that important to standardized and improved the surgical procedure for rectal cancer. With the development of anatomical technique, minimally surgery with laparoscopy had become the trend for surgical treatment. There were several studies has been done to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery. In order to achieve better surgical outcome and reduce operative complications, the investigators design stratified randomization, double blinded, muti - center clinical trail to investigate the value of left colic artery in laparoscopic radical rectectomy.
