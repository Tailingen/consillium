Phase 1 Dose Escalation of ArtemiCoffee
This is a phase I dose-escalation study of Artemisia annua (Aa) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have completed front-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Artemisia annua.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Artemisia annua 450mg|DRUG: Artemisia annua 900mg|DRUG: Artemisia annua 1350mg|DRUG: Artemisia annua 1800mg|DRUG: Artemisia annua - recommended phase II dose
Recommended Phase II Dose, This study will determine the recommended phase II dose of Artemisia annua decaffeinated coffee. Once the dose escalation is finished or 12 patients are evaluated for the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the final recommended phase II dose will be determined by isotonic regression to pool the DLT information across all dose levels., 150 days
Progression Free Survival, Median progression free survival will be calculated for all groups., 150 days
Change in plasma concentration of artemisinin., The change in plasma concentration of artemisinin will be measured pre- and post-study., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)|Change in plasma concentration of dihydroartemisinin., The change in plasma concentration of dihydroartemisinin will be measured pre- and post-study., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)|Change in NQ01 expression., Change in cell-free (cfRNA) levels of NQ01 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1) will be measured at baseline and post-treatment., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)|Change in HO-1 expression., Change in cell-free (cfRNA) levels of HO1 (heme oxygenase 1) will be measured at baseline and post-treatment., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)|Change in ABCF2 expression., Change in cell-free (cfRNA) levels of HO1 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family F member 2) will be measured at baseline and post-treatment., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)|Change in CD99 expression., Change in cell-free (cfRNA) levels of CD99 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family F member 2) will be measured at baseline and post-treatment., Up to 150 days (baseline and post-treatment)
This is a phase I dose-escalation study of Artemisia annua (Aa) decaffeinated coffee in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have completed front-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Aa decaf coffee pods. Sequential cohorts of three patients per cohort will have escalating doses of Aa, starting with one cup per day (450mg) and with a maximum of 4 cups per day (1800mg). After identifying the RP2D, the study will evaluate an expansion cohort of 6 patients for further tolerability and secondary endpoints. The secondary endpoints include: 1) Efficacy as measured by time to tumor progression or recurrence; 2) the ability of Aa decaf coffee to influence downstream biomarkers of the NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathway; and 3) plasma concentrations of artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin.
