Phase II Study of Sunitinib Rechallenge in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Targeted therapies are associated with (acquired) resistance after a median of 5-11 months of treatment, resulting in disease progression, while almost no tumors are intrinsically resistant in the first line setting. The investigators recently published that tumor cell resistance to sunitinib may be directly related to lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib. This resistance mechanism was shown to be transient, since a drug-free culture period could normalize the lysosomal storage capacity for sunitinib and resulted in recovery of drug sensitivity.

In two reports it has been suggested that patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma who responded to sunitinib in the first-line setting may benefit from rechallenge with sunitinib after failure of second-line treatment. However, these data are retrospective. A prospective trial to investigate a rechallenge with sunitinib is needed to determine whether this strategy is of benefit for patients with mRCC with prior clinical benefit to sunitinib but who stopped treatment because of overt clinical resistance.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
Progression free survival, To investigate the proportion of patients with metastic Renal Cell Carcinoma retreated with sunitinib that is progression-free at 3 months., After 3 months of treatment
Clinical benefit rate, To assess the clinical benefit rate (ORR and SD), median Progression Free Survival (mPFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in individuals retreated with sunitinib., progression free at 3 months|Effects of sunitinib rechallenge on LAMP1/2 proteins, To assess the effects of sunitinib rechallenge on Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1/2(LAMP1/2) proteins in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and tumor tissue., Blood samples will be collected at baseline, t=4 wk, t=6 wk, t=12 wk and at the end of study treatment (disease progression and/or death)|The immunological effects of sunitinib rechallenge, To assess the immunological effects of sunitinib rechallenge on the number and activation state of circulating Dendritic Cell(DC), Myeloid-Derived Suppressor cell (MDSC) and Regulatory T-cell (Tregs)., Blood samples will be collected at baseline, t=4 wk, t=6 wk, t=12 wk and at the end of study treatment (disease progression and/or death).|Mass spectrometry-based identification of phosphorylated proteins in tumor tissue during treatment, To study phosphoproteomic profiles of tumors before rechallenge and at the time of progression. LC-MS/MS-based phospho-proteomics for the identification of sunitinib response and resistance biomarkers, Blood samples will be collected at baseline, t=4 wk, t=6 wk, t=12 wk and at the end of study treatment (disease progression and/or death).|Concentrations of sunitinib, To assess sunitinib drug levels and tumor tissue concentrations of sunitinib., Blood samples will be collected at baseline, t=4 wk, t=6 wk, t=12 wk and at the end of study treatment (disease progression and/or death).|Effect of retreatment, To evaluate the effect of retreatment with sunitinib on the quality of life., progression free at 3 months
