Study Combining Bortezomib With High Dose Melphalan to Treat Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerance and potential efficacy of combining dose intense melphalan with escalating doses of bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib 1 mg/m2|DRUG: Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2|DRUG: Bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2|DRUG: Melphalan
The Maximum Tolerated Dose of Bortezomib (MTD), The Maximum Tolerated Dose of Bortezomib (MTD) Will be Defined as the Dose Level Prior to That Resulting in Two Out of Six Patients Experiencing a DLT, During dosing of Bortezomib on Day -4 to Day -1 of ASCT
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy that has affected approximately 40,000 Americans.Conventional chemotherapy has achieved limited control of this disease but studies have reported improved response rates for patients who are treated with dose-intense therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This Phase I/II study will investigate the potential of combination therapy of dose-intense melphalan with escalating doses of bortezomib.
