Treatment will be administered in two phases. Subjects will continue treatment until they experience progressive disease (PD) or experience unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw consent, or the investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) will enter phase 2 of the study. Subjects may remain on phase 2 of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue throughout phase 2 until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity, withdraws consent, or the investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
