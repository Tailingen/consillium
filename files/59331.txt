BIO 300 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Study
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of BIO 300 Oral Suspension when used in combination with standard dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Based on preclinical data the investigators hypothesize that BIO 300 Oral Suspension will reduce the incidence of radiation-induced pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis.

This is an open-label, single-arm, ascending dose Phase I/II study of BIO 300 Oral Suspension given in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin and radiotherapy in subjects with stage II, III, or IV NSCLC who are candidates for combined chemoradiotherapy.

A minimum of 6 subjects will be accrued sequentially at each dose level of BIO 300. BIO 300 will be administered daily for the entire course of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, a minimum of 6 weeks; in combination with standard paclitaxel / carboplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

The initial dose of BIO 300 will be administered on Day 1, Visit 2 in which safety data (adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), results of safety laboratory determinations), pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be collected. PK data will be collected from a minimum of six (6) study subjects from each cohort. PD data will be collected from all subjects in each study cohort. Day 1 of chemotherapy will be scheduled at the discretion of the investigator provided the subject has completed a minimum of 1 day of BIO 300 dosing. BIO 300 will be administered in combination with the chemotherapy components of the protocol (paclitaxel and carboplatin). During the first or second chemotherapy infusion, additional safety, PK and PD data will be collected. Day 1 of radiation therapy (RT) may be scheduled at the discretion of the investigator provided the subject has completed a minimum of 2 days of BIO 300 dosing. BIO 300 will continue to be administered daily; paclitaxel and carboplatin will be administered weekly and radiotherapy will be administered daily until a total dose of 60-70 Gy has been administered. During the period of combined BIO 300 and chemoradiotherapy (6-7 weeks), additional safety, PK and PD data will be collected weekly. An interim data analysis will be completed once the highest dose cohort concludes chemoradiation therapy, in an effort to determine the optimal biological dose. Following analysis, there will be an option to enroll up to an additional 12 subjects at the optimal biological dose. At the conclusion of the study, primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated. Data will be analyzed from all cohorts to determine the oncologic response, safety of BIO 300, and a recommended BIO 300 dose.
