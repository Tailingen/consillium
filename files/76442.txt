Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Inecalcitol in Imatinib-Treated Residual Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia: INIM Study
To assess the efficacy of inecalcitol in combination with imatinib in CML patients with molecular residual disease on imatinib monotherapy.
CML, Chronic Phase
DRUG: Inecalcitol
Measure the proportion of responders, Proportion of responder defined as patients achieving MR4.5 (i.e. detectable disease ≤ 0.0032 % BCR-ABLIS or undetectable disease with cDNA with ≥32,000 ABL1 transcripts) at any time within 12 months after the initiation of inecalcitol., 12 months
To determine:

* Duration of response
* Progression free survival
* Proportion of responders 2 years after discontinuation of inecalcitol
* Duration of response after discontinuation of inecalcitol and imatinib
* Bone remodelling effect
* Safety of inecalcitol in combination with imatinib
* Quality of Life
