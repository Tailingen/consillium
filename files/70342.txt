NK Cells Infusions With Irinotecan, Temozolomide, and Dinutuximab
This is a Phase 1 study with Phase 2 expansion cohort. Phase 1 will assess the safety and tolerability of universal donor TGFβi NK Cell in combination with irinotecan, temozolomide, and dinituximab. The phase 2 of the study will estimate the response to treatment.

NK cells safety and tolerability: Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events and toxicities, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events and toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 12 months|Response to NK Cell treatment as determine by CT/MRI imaging, To estimate the response to treatment, as determined by disease status evaluated using CT/MRI scans through the measuring tool RECIST., 24 months|Response to NK Cell treatment as determine by MIBG scans imaging, To estimate the response to treatment, as determined by disease status evaluated using MIBG scans through the Curie score system., 24 months|Response to NK Cell treatment as determine by bone marrow aspiration, To estimate the response to treatment, as determined by disease status evaluated using bone marrow aspiration and biopsy through H\&E stain. RECIST., 24 months
Toxicity Definition of NK cells, Toxicity will be graded using the CTCAE criteria, version 5.0. All grade 3+ toxicities will be reviewed for attribution., 36 months
Assessment of the phenotype of expanded NK cells for neuroblastoma patients, NK cell phenotypes will be measured by mass cytometry (unit of measure= % of nucleated cells), 36 months|Assessment of function of expanded NK cells for neuroblastoma patients, NK cell functional potency will be measured as cytotoxicity by calcien- AM cytotoxicity assays (unit of measure= % of patietns with complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) with calculated 95% confidence intervals), 36 months|In vivo persistence of NK cells after adoptive transfer., To assess in vivo persistence of expanded NK cells after adoptive transfer by assessing NK cell number and phenotype in peripheral blood using mass cytometry., 36 months|Correlation of persistence of NK cells after adoptive transfer with clinical outcomes, Clinical outcomes will be assessed by disease response using CT/MRI scans, I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, 36 months
