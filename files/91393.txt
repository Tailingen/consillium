DEB-TACE Treatment in 367 Liver Cancer Patients
Introduction:The drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is introduced to better improve efficacy and reduce the systemic toxicity in liver cancer patients on account of its higher intratumoral chemotherapeutic drug concentration and reduced drug infiltration into systemic circulation. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors of DEB-TACE treatment in Chinese patients with liver cancer.

Hypothesis:DEB-TACE illustrates a better treatment response, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and less common adverse events (AEs) in liver cancer patients.

Objective: to investigate the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors of DEB-TACE treatment in Chinese patients with liver cancer.
Liver Cancer
Treatment response, Treatment response was assessed at 1-3 months after DEB-TACE treatment according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) by enhanced computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination., One-three months after DEB-TACE treatment
overall survival, OS was calculated from the time of DEB-TACE operation to the time of patient's death from any causes., The median follow-up duration was 171 (range from 38 to 404) days.|Liver function evaluation, Liver function indexes including ALB, TP, TBIL, TBA, ALT, AST and ALP were recorded before, 1 week post and 1-3 months post DEB-TACE treatment to evaluate the influence of DEB-TACE on liver function. The analysis of liver function evaluation was based on the treatment records of DEB-TACE ., One week post and 1-3 months post DEB-TACE treatment.|Adverse events (AEs), AEs were recorded during DEB-TACE operation and 1 month after DEB-TACE operation, and the analysis of AEs was based on the treatment records of DEB-TACE., During DEB-TACE operation and 1 month after DEB-TACE operation.
