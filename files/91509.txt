This study is an open, two-stage, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of AB011 injection in patients with CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors. The study is composed of two stages: stage I is single treatment and stage II is combo treatment.
