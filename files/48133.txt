Management of Malignant Pleural Effusion With Indwelling Pleural Catheter Versus Silver Nitrate Pleurodesis
The primary goal of this study is to compare well-defined pleural effusion management success outcomes in patients with malignant or paramalignant pleural effusions who were treated with Indwelling pleural catheter insertion compared with those treated with siver nitrate pleurodesis. It is also to demonstrate the effectiveness of silver nitrate pleurodesis. It is also important to evaluate frequent adverse events of silver nitrate pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion
Pleural Effusion, Malignant
DRUG: Silver Nitrate|DEVICE: Indwelling Pleural Catheter
Success rate of silver nitrate pleurodesis, patients will be submitted to serial chest x-ray and evaluation of pleural fluid accumulation by chest ultrasound ., One week|Success rate of silver nitrate pleurodesis, Pleural fluid re-accumulation will be evaluated by chest x-ray and chest ultrasound., One month
Chest pain: VAS, Chest pain will be evaluated by visual analog scale which varies from (0-10) in which grade 0 indicates no hurt and grade 10 which hurts worst, One week|Dyspnea, Dyspnea will be evaluated through the mMRC dyspnea scale ( modified medical research council dyspnea scale) which varies from ( 0-4) in which grade 0 indicates dyspnea with sternous exercise and grade 4 which indicates dyspnea with dressing or undressing, One week
Dyspnea is present in 50% of patients with malignant pleural effusion and quality of life is significantly impaired.

Chemical pleurodesis using various sclerosing agents is accepted as a palliative therapy for patients with recurrent, symptomatic, and malignant pleural effusions.

Silver nitrate solution (SNS) is a valid sclerosing agent that induce a caustic injury to the mesothelium that results in an effective pleurodesis.

However, various clinical parameters and biochemical factors affect the success of pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE: symptoms and performance status of the patient, daily fluid drainage, primary tumour, and mainly lung reexpansion following pleural fluid evacuation.

The pleural injectate consists of 50 mL 0.5% SNS with 10mL of lidocaine (25mg/5mL).

An alternative treatment is intermittent or continuous drainage of the pleural fluid with a chronic indwelling pleural catheter.
