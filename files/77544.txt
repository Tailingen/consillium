A Pilot Study of Lenalidomide, Melphalan and Dexamethasone in AL Amyloidosis
This open-label trial will evaluate the use of lenalidomide; melphalan; and dexamethasone (MDR) to treat newly diagnosed or relapsed AL amyloidosis, over the course of nine 28-day cycles.
Leukemia|Amyloidosis
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Hematologic Response Rate, At the end of each treatment cycle (4 weeks), hematologic response rate as assessed. Hematologic response was considered to be amyloid complete response (normal FLC ratio and negative serum and urine immunofixation); very good partial response (difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs \[dFLC\] \< 40 mg/L); or partial response (dFLC decrease \> 50%)., 8 weeks
Overall Survival (OS), Participants alive 12 months after starting MDR treatment., 12 months|Event-free Survival (EFS), Assessed as the median value for EFS 12 months after starting MDR treatment, 12 months|Duration of Response, Assessed as the median value for the time from first partial response until progression; death; or last follow-up., 32 months
The study will evaluate the 3-drug combination of lenalidomide; melphalan; and dexamethasone (MDR) as the absence of disease progression or toxicity, patients will complete nine 28-day cycles of MDR therapy, with the option of continuing treatment with lenalidomide as single-agent. Patients received up to nine cycles of treatment, with the option to continue on lenalidomide as a single agent if they responded to treatment.
