Safety and Immunogenicity of Personalized Genomic Vaccine and Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) to Treat Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to use precision medicine in the form of a vaccine, a mutation-derived tumor antigen vaccine (MTA-based vaccine) in combination with standard care treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields).

The study is designed to determine whether this treatment combination is well tolerated and safe.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Poly-ICLC|DEVICE: Tumor Treating Fields|BIOLOGICAL: Peptides
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), Feasibility administration of one vaccine; toxicity will be measured by severity of Adverse events with toxicity grading defined by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program's (CTEP) v4.0 of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale, 42 weeks
Toxicity grading using CTCAE scale, Safety will be measured by number of Adverse events with toxicity grading defined by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program's (CTEP) v4.0 of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale, 1 year|The percent Progression Free Survival (PFS), 6 months|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, 1 year|Overall Response Rate, Overall response as measured by RANO (Response assessment in neuro-oncology) Response Criteria: Complete response, Partial response, Stable Disease, and Progressive Disease, 2 years
This is a single-arm, single institution phase 1a / 1b study to test the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MTA-based personalized vaccine in patients with newly diagnosed GBM along with the use of continual TTFields. MTA-based personalized vaccine is prepared in the laboratory with several peptides based on each patient's own tumor sequence.

The vaccine is given after the radiation and chemotherapy portion of the treatment, in the maintenance phase of temozolomide in conjunction with the TTFields.
