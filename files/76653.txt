Protocol for Herceptin as Adjuvant Therapy With Reduced Exposure to Chemotherapy (PHARE-C)
RATIONALE: According to previous results from PHARE study, a subgroup of patients with low-risk cancer (\< 3 cm) without axillary lymph node involvement or small (\< 2 cm) with minimal lymph node involvement (1 positive node) presented low risk of recurrence. Maintaining chemotherapy in this subgroup could cause toxicity and it is not yet known whether giving trastuzumab as monotherapy in neoadjuvant setting is as effective as giving trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel in patients with low risk early breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying trastuzumab as monotherapy in neoadjuvant setting to see if this treatment regimen is as efficient compared to trastuzumab combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy in treating women with low risk (tumor size\< 3 cm, N0) early breast cancer.

PHARE-C is an open-label, randomized, phase III, non-inferiority trial, that will recruit patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer to allow for comparison of neoadjuvant treatment with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab versus trastuzumab as monotherapy.

Non-inferiority between the two treatment arms will be evaluated in terms of time to progression as primary objective. Treatment tolerance and cardiac toxicity will be assessed as secondary objectives.

In case of non pCR, a rescue by Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is planned to control the survival outcome.
