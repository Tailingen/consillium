Reduced-dose Chemotherapy Followed by Blinatumomab in Induction Therapy of Newly Diagnosed Non-elderly Ph-B-ALL
Blinatumomab, a CD3/CD19 bisespecific T-cell conjugative antibody, has shown high efficacy in phase I/II studies of relapsed/refractory B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly in the context of low tumor burden.Meanwhile, Blinatumomab also plays an important role in rapid and efficient clearance of MRD in patients. Therefore, its use in combination with less intensive chemotherapy for initial induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients may result in favorable response rates, greater depth of remission, and lower treatment-related toxic effects.

In this study, newly diagnosed non-elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosomal negative (PH-) B-ALL were enrolled and treated with reduced-intensity chemotherapy followed by Blinatumomab as the basis of induction therapy. The clinical remission rate, MRD negative rate and treaty-related adverse reactions were evaluated in newly diagnosed non-elderly PH-B-ALL patients during induction therapy.
