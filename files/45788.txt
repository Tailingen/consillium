BB-10901 in Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as BB-10901, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BB-10901 in treating patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: BB-10901
Dose-limiting toxicity, through cycle 1|Maximum tolerated dose, for the duration of the study
Qualitative and quantitative toxicities, for the duration of the study|Pharmacokinetics, for the duration of the study|Anti-tumor activity including overall response rate, time to progression and survival, for the duration of the study
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of BB-10901 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD56-positive multiple myeloma.

Secondary

* To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of BB-10901 administered on this schedule.
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BB-10901.
* To recommend a dose for Phase II clinical studies with BB-10901 given on this specific regimen.
* To observe any evidence of anti-tumor activity with BB-10901.

Objectives of MTD Expansion Cohort

* To evaluate response rate including overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR), and duration of response (DOR).
* To further assess time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

Patients receive BB-10901 IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BB-10901 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 40 patients are treated at the MTD.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for short term follow-up and long term (up to 3 years) survival status.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
