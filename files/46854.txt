Brazilian Reality of Urinary Bladder Cancers - BRA-BLADDER
A national, multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective, observational study (Real-World Evidence-RWE) aimed at analyzing clinical presentation profiles and demographic characteristics of patients with early urothelial bladder cancer (high-risk non-muscle invasive and localized muscle-invasive) treated with standard therapies in national cancer treatment reference centers within the last 6 years (between 2017 and 2022).

Urothelial carcinoma has several histological types, extensive genetic diversity and a wide array of risk factors related to disease development. Moreover, the treatment effectiveness may be widely impacted by factors such as age, previous comorbidities, socio-economic factors, late diagnosis and access to treatment. In the last decade, the treatment profile has evolved worldwide with the incorporation of new technologies, however, there is no data on Brazilian reality in this period. In a continent-sized country and such heterogeneous health services as Brazil, preparing such knowledge becomes more important and challenging. This paper proposed to describe early urothelial carcinoma presentation pattern and treatment in Brazilian population (high-risk non-muscle-invasive and localized muscle-invasive) in several sites spread throughout the national territory. Thus, data will be generated to provide a more appropriate understanding of the current landscape and, consequently, the better design of public policies to face this disease.
