SHR-1701 in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is an open label, phase Ib Study of SHR-1701 in patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma(R/M NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: SHR-1701|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Albumin Paclitaxel
Toxicity Toxicity, Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR, PR or SD per RECIST 1.1., up to 2 years|Immunogenicity of SHR-1701, anti SHR-1603 antibodies (ADA), up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. OS will be measured by the Method of Kaplan and Meier., up to 2 years
The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-1701 in patients with R/M NPC. The secondary purpose is to assess the anti-tumor activity and immunogenicity of SHR-1701 in R/M NPC.
