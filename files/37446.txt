Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Determine progression-free survival rate, Determine the toxicity and loco-regional control by using accelerated RTH in squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck, Baseline
* HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with 890.000 new cases and 450.000 deaths in 2018.
* The incidence of HNSCC continues to rise and is anticipated to increase by 30% (that is, 1.08 million new cases annually) by 2030.
* Squamous cell carcinoma constitutes 90% of all head and neck cancers and it predominates in males.
* Risk factors such as cigarette consumption and alcohol consumption, are well established.
* Treatment decisions are guided by clinic-pathologic factors such as age and stage.
* Treatment of the majority of patients with HNSCC requires multimodality approaches.
* Radiotherapy or surgery alone can be considered as the standard treatment modality for patients having early head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
* When conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is used, long-term tumor control can be achieved in less than 30% of patients with advanced head and neck carcinomas.
