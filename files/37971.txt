A Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Anti-Cancer Activity of Trametinib in Combination With Palbociclib in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a dose-escalation, Phase I/II, open-label, three-part study. Part 1 is designed to determine the recommended dose and schedule for the orally administered MEK inhibitor trametinib, given together with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in subjects with solid tumors. Multiple dose levels of each inhibitor will be tested to determine the recommended dose and schedule. Part 2 will evaluate the effect of the combination on tumor biomarkers safety, and anti-cancer activity in subjects with cutaneous melanoma that do not have a change at BRAFV600. Approximately 100-200 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will receive trametinib and/or palbociclib until disease progression, death, consent withdrawal or unacceptable adverse event (AE).

Data was only collected and analyzed for the Phase I component of the study, the Phase II component of the study was terminated without data collection

Part 1: Change from baseline in vital signs, Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate, Up to 36 months|Part 1: Change from baseline in physical examination findings, A complete physical examination will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes and extremities, Up to 36 months|Part 1: Change from baseline in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) assessment, Up to 36 months|Part 1: Change from baseline in echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multi Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans assessment, An ECHO (preferred) or a MUGA scan will be performed at baseline to assess cardiac ejection fraction and cardiac valve morphology for the purpose of study eligibility, Up to 36 months|Part 1: Change from baseline in chemistry and hematology laboratory values, Up to 36 months|Part 1: Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), All subjects (approximately 50), From the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment|Part 1: Composite of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters following trametinib and palbociclib administration, PK parameters will include: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC\[0-t\]), oral clearance (CL/F), minimum observed concentration (Cmin). Blood samples of approximately 2 mL for trametinib and 2 mL for palbociclib (4 mL total) will be collected for PK analysis at each timepoint shown for all subjects (approximately 50), Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post dose) and Cycle 2 Day 15 (pre-dose)|Part 1: Number of subjects with anti-cancer activity, Disease progression and response evaluations will be determined according to the definitions established in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1) for all subjects (approximately 50 in Part 1), Up to 36 months|Part 2: Change from baseline in tumor biomarkers, Change from baseline in biomarkers like pERK, total Rb, Ki67, FoxM1, p16, and CCDN1 will be calculated. These markers will be evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue via immunohistochemistry (IHC), Screening and Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose)
Part 1: GSK1120212 and PD-0332991 PK parameters following repeat-dose administration of trametinib and palbociclib, The following PK parameters will be calculated: Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC\[0-tau\]), minimum observed concentration (Cmin), pre-dose (trough) concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctau), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax), and terminal phase half-life (t1/2) (if data permits), Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post dose) and Cycle 2 Day 15 (pre-dose)|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of subjects with response rate, Subjects whose disease responds (either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]), using RECIST Version 1.1 (up to approximately 100 subjects), Up to 36 months for part 1 and 24 months for part 2|Part 1 and Part 2 : Number of subjects with Duration of response (DOR), up to approximately 100 subjects, Up to 36 months for part 1 and 24 months for part 2|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of subjects with Progression-free survival (PFS), up to approximately 100 subjects, Up to 36 months for part 1 and 24 months for part 2|Part 2 : Change from baseline in vital signs, Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate, Up to 24 months|Part 2: Change from baseline in physical examination findings, A complete physical examination will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes and extremities, Up to 24 months|Part 2: Change from baseline in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) assessment, Up to 24 months|Part 2: Change from baseline in echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multi Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans assessment, An ECHO (preferred) or a MUGA scan will be performed at baseline to assess cardiac ejection fraction and cardiac valve morphology for the purpose of study eligibility, Up to 24 months|Part 2 : Change from baseline in chemistry and hematology laboratory values, Up to 24 months|Part 2 : Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), up to 40 subjects, From the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment|Part 2: Composite of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters following trametinib and palbociclib administration, PK parameters will include: Cmax, tmax, AUC(0-t), CL/F, Cmin.
