Pleural Bleomycin vs Mechanical Abrasion in Malignant Pleural Effusion
Comparision between pleurodesis by pleural abrasion using medical thoracoscopy and bleomycin instillation via indwelling pleural catheter. Evaluating the effectiveness of pleural abrasion using medical thoracoscopy in patients with malignant pleural effusion and evaluating the role of ROSE in diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion
Malignant Pleural Effusion
PROCEDURE: Group 1 (mechanical pleurodesis)|PROCEDURE: Group 2 chemical pleurodesis by bleomycin)
Assessment of successful pleurodesis by chest ultrasound, This will be done every 2 weeks to detect any recollection of fluid in the pleural space. It will be used to determine whether the intervention achieved full or partial success, 6 months
Malignant pleural effusion cause significant morbidity so drainage effusion can provide great palliation and improve quality of life of these patients. There are several diagnostic tools for diagnosing malignant pleural effusion as pleural fluid cytology, closed pleural biopsy or thoracosopic pleural biopsy. Medical thoracoscopy has significant role in diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion. Also, pleurodesis may be performed through it by mechanical methods as pleural abrasion or chemical methods by talc poudrage, bleomycin or cisplatin instillation . and surgically through pleurectomy. Recently, using of ROSE (Rapis On-Site Examination) technique during medical thoracoscopy showed high accuracy for distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions, and this help in decision making. In our study, we will use mechanical pleurodesis by pleural abrasion using medical thoracoscpy and chemical pleurodesis by instillation of bleomycin via indwelling pleural catheter.
