A Phase 1/2 Study of KSQ-004EX, Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Engineered to Inactivate Genes Encoding SOCS1 and Regnase-1, in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors
Phase 1 is to find the recommended dose of KSQ-004EX to give to participants with advanced solid tumors.

Phase 2 is to learn if KSQ-004EX at the recommended dose found in Phase1 can help to control advanced solid tumors.

The safety and effects of KSQ-004EX will also be studied in both phases.

Phase 1: Dose Escalation

Primary Objective:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KSQ-004EX in adult participants with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and cervical cancer) Secondary Objectives
* Determine expansion dose
* Assess the safety and tolerability of KSQ-004EX in participants with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and cervical cancer)
* Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of KSQ-004EX in participants with advanced solid tumors
* Evaluate the feasibility of the manufacturing process

Phase 2: Expansion Primary Objective

* To assess the anti-tumor activity of KSQ-004EX in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors Secondary Objectives
* Assess the safety and tolerability of KSQ-004EX in participants with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and cervical cancer)
* Evaluate anti-tumor activity of KSQ-004EX in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors
* Evaluate overall survival (OS)
* Evaluate the feasibility of the manufacturing process
