Genomic Evaluation in Patients With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma After First Relapse/Progression
DLBCL has the highest frequency out of all lymphoid malignancies. With the recent development of antitumor agents targeting intracellular/extracellular cell signaling pathways, patients have access to various treatment options after relapse. Therefore, for the purpose of developing effective treatment strategies, large-scale genomic data accumulation is necessary to understand the mechanism of relapse and refractory state of DLBCL.

Next generation sequencing with tumor tissue, To understand the mechanism of relapse, targeted sequencing based on HemaScan panel including the essential genes (including 425 whole exome)., 2-year follow-up from the end of the enrollment|Next generation sequencing with blood, To understand the mechanism of relapse, targeted sequencing based on HemaScan panel including the essential genes (including 425 whole exome)., 2-year follow-up from the end of the enrollment
Data which included salvage chemotherapy., Progression free survival, response rate for salvage chemotherapy., 2-year follow-up from the end of the enrollment|Data which included survival outcome., Overall survival, 2-year follow-up from the end of the enrollment
* To understand the mechanism of relapse by genome sequencing with tissues/blood obtained at diagnosis and relapse in patients with diffuse B cell lymphoma who relapsed after standard chemotherapy, to evaluate their response and survival following a salvage therapy depending on the genomic sequencing results, and to understand the prognostic or predictive value of genomic mutation.
* To understand the predictive value of genetic information with regard to the response to salvage chemotherapy and survival outcome in patients with newly diagnosed/relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma
* To determine the association between gene mutation, treatment response and prognosis in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and to develop a clinically applicable platform by establishing a genetic data register based on prospective studies
