Systemic, Intrapulmonary and Pleural Inflammatory Reaction in Patients Undergoing Thoracic Surgery
Inflammatory reaction in different compartments of the body may have a negative effect on outcome. This study assesses the inflammatory reaction systemically, intrapulmonary and intrapleural by measuring different cytokines. Patients with lung cancer undergoing lobectomy or segmentectomy are included in the study. Hypothesis: The inflammatory reaction in the pleural space is high compared to the systemic and intrapulmonary ones.
