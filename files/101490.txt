Preoperative Chemo-radiation With IG-IMRT Dose Escalation for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancers
Hypothesis : Therapeutic intensification by increasing the dose delivered to the tumor by RCMI (conformational radiotherapy by intensity modulation) in order to reduce local relapse, often associated with poor prognosis

Primary objective: evaluate the rate of tumor sterilization and the toxicities of RTCT with concomitant boost in intensity modulation in patients with rectal cancer CT3-T4 and / or cN1-2.
Advanced Rectal Cancers
RADIATION: Preoperative chemo-radiation with IG-IMRT dose escalation
Complete histological response rate, Absence of residual cancer cells on the final analysis of the tumor and lymph node, at 8 weeks after inclusion
Tolerance, Toxicity is assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE toxicity scale version 4.0, at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 13 weeks after inclusion and at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36 months after surgery
