A Study to Determine the Recommended Dose and Schedule, and Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Mezigdomide in Combination With Elranatamab in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and determine the RP2D of mezigdomide in combination with elranatamab in participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
