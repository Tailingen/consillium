The primary objective of the study is to analyse a local cohort of patients aged 18-39 years with melanoma diagnosis in order to determine the prevalence of the disease in this age group.

Secondary objectives are the following:

* To identify risk factors associated with melanoma in young people.
* To characterise the phenotype and dermoscopic features of melanoma in patients aged 18-39 years.
* To analyse the relationship between the clinical and histopathological features of melanoma in young people.
* To identify the mutational status of B-RAF in the sample of patients analysed.
