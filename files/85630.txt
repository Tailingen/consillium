Safety and Aesthetic Outcomes of Breast Conserving Surgery With Peri-areolar Incision Approach
Cosmetic result after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) would impose great effect upon patient's quality of life. Although peri-areolar incision has been widely used in benign breast tumor excision, mastopexy procedures and skin-sparing mastectomy with primary reconstruction, the actual safety and aesthetic outcome of the peri-areolar incision approach in BCS for cancer patients has not been established by randomized, controlled trials.

This trial was design to compare the Safety and aesthetic outcomes of breast conserving surgery between peri-areolar incision approach and traditional methods.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: peri-areolar incision|PROCEDURE: traditional incision
event free survival, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, death, 5 years
aesthetic outcomes, aesthetic score and QOL score, two weeks, half a year and one year|cost, operation time for the surgery, hospital stay days, costs, 2 weeks
The Trial aims to determine whether BCS with the peri-areolar approach: 1) is safe in terms of the rates of recurrence and metastasis; 2) can improve the post-operative aesthetic score and QOL score.
