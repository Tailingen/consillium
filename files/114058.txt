This is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, dose-finding, consecutive-cohort, open-label trial of BI-1206 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have previously received treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The trial will consist of 2 main parts:

Phase 1 with 2 different sets of cohorts assessing IV or SC dosing, with dose escalation of BI-1206 and selection of the RP2D of IV dosing (ivRP2D) and the RP2D of SC dosing (scRP2D).

Phase 2a with 3 expansion cohorts at the scRP2D for all subjects treated with pembrolizumab and BI-1206. Each of the 3 expansion cohorts will comprise a specific subset of subjects with advanced solid tumors (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and other tumor types known to be responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition).

Subjects will initially receive 3 cycles of therapy with pembrolizumab in combination with BI-1206, either IV or SC.

Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) at the Week 9 Visit may continue on combination therapy (pembrolizumab/BI-1206). Starting at Week 10, these subjects will receive additional cycles of pembrolizumab and BI-1206 every 3 weeks for up to 32 additional cycles or up to 2 years from their first dose of BI-1206 therapy or until progression.
