A Cohort Study of Hyperthermia and Imiquimod for the Treatment of Flat Warts
flat warts are a superficial viral skin disease, extremely common in childhood.Treatment of warts is often difficult and involves different destructive procedures.Although several pharmacological and physical topical treatments are available (keratolytic agents, electrosurgery, cryotherapy, carbon dioxide laser), results are often unsatisfactory in terms of efficacy (frequent recurrence) and cosmetic outcome (scars, inflammatory reactions, transient or permanent hyper- or hypopigmentation).

Mild local Hyperthermia with a certain temperature range has been successfully used in the treatment of some diseases. It has been utilised in the treatment of some neoplasm, fungal and HPV infections. Investigators' study found that local hyperthermia at 44°C could cleared HPV in more than half of the patients with plantar warts. Investigators also note the fact that in patients with multiple lesions, the clearance of the target lesion is commonly followed by clearance of other distant lesions, a phenomenon suggesting that local hyperthermia could aid in establishing a specific immune response to eliminate HPV.So the purpose of the study is to evaluation local hyperthermia in the treatment of flat warts Appropriate control arms were designed for different conditions.
