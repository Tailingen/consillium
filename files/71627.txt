Magic Mouthwash Plus Sucralfate Versus Benzydamine Hydrochloride for the Treatment of Radiation-induced Mucositis
Radiation treatment is very effective for treating cancers of the head and neck, however, during the course of treatment, it is common for patients to experience soreness of their mouth and throat due to the radiation. When radiation causes inflammation of the inside of the mouth, it is called 'mucositis'. There are several mouthwashes that are commonly used to prevent and treat mucositis, but none of these have been shown to be superior to another. This study is being conducted to see if using a combination of magic mouthwash and sucralfate is better than using a single mouthwash called benzydamine at decreasing the burden of mucositis.
Head and Neck Cancer|Mucositis
DRUG: Combination of Magic Mouthwash Plus Sucralfate|DRUG: 0.15% Benzydamine HCl
The severity of patient-reported symptoms of mucositis as determined by the change in Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire - Head and Neck Cancer (OMWQ-HN) score from baseline to 6 weeks., Baseline to 6 weeks after the initiation of radiotherapy.
The severity of patient-reported symptoms of mucositis throughout the course radiotherapy as determined by the area under the curve for mean change in OMWQ-HN scores from baseline., Baseline to 10 weeks after initiating radiotherapy.|Incidence of WHO Grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis after 4 weeks of radiotherapy., 4 weeks after initiating radiotherapy
Sixty patients with head and neck cancer being treated with 6 or more weeks of radiotherapy, will be randomly assigned to receive either a combination of magic mouthwash (diphenhydramine, dexamethasone and nystatin) plus sucralfate or benzydamine. Patients randomized to receive magic mouthwash plus sucralfate will rinse first with 5ml of the magic mouthwash for 2 minutes then swallow, followed by rinsing with 5ml of the 1g/5ml sucralfate for 2 minutes before swallowing, 4 times daily. Patients randomized to receive 0.15% benzydamine HCl will be instructed to rinse with 15ml of the solution for 2 minutes before expectorating, 4 times daily. Patients will start the mouthwash regimens prior to the initiation of radiotherapy, and stop 2 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
