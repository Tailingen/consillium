Evaluation of the Benefit of a New Surgical Procedure According to IDEAL Recommendations for ORL Cancer Patients: the External Pudendal Flap Used as a New Free Flap for Oral Cavity/Oropharyngeal Reconstruction to Limit Donor Site Sequelae
This is a phase 1b, multicenter, non-randomized prospective study involving an innovation phase (IDEAL-1) followed by a prospective development phase (IDEAL-2A) designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of oral/oropharyngeal reconstruction with the external pudendal free flap in two groups of patients.

A maximum of 40 patients (20 patients per group) will be included in this IDEAL-1/2A phase study.

Stage IDEAL-1: Innovation phase. The main objective is to evaluate the feasibility in terms of limiting surgical complications of a STEPA flap reconstruction in two groups of patients (Cohort: Male, Female).

Stage IDEAL-2A: Prospective development phase. The main objective is to describe the complication profile of the surgical procedure in these two patient populations.

Each patient will be followed during 12 months after the end of complete treatment (surgery ± adjuvant treatment).

A complementary study (observational study) of 250 patients will also be conducted to evaluate the acceptability of the technique (reconstruction by external pudendal flap) by the patients and to describe the factors associated with this acceptability.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oral Cavity Cancer|Oropharynx Cancer
PROCEDURE: Oropharyngeal or oral cavity reconstruction
The occurrence of a limiting complication. Limiting complications are defined as total flap necrosis (flap failure) or donor site infection (Fournier Gangrene) within 4 weeks of the experimental procedure., 4 weeks for each patient
The postoperative complications will be evaluated according to the NCI-CTCAE version n°5, 12 months for each patient|The pain will be assessed according to a Likert scale between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain)., 12 months for each patient|The functional capacity of swallowing will be assessed via the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck cancer patients - PSS-HN (Scales are: Normalcy of Diet, Public Eating, and Understandability of Speech)., 12 months for each patient|4. The aesthetic evaluation will be performed according to a Likert scale (Likert scale: not at all satisfied, somewhat not satisfied, neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, somewhat satisfied, very satisfied)., 12 months for each patient
