A Study of Oncolytic Virus Injection (RT-01) in Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single-arm, open-label, clinical pharmacology study to evaluate safety and efficacy of oncolytic virus injection(RT-01) in Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, The immunoreactivity, The immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Oncolytic Virus Injection(RT-01)
Incidence of adverse events, Graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 6 months|To evaluate the antitumor activity, To assessed per RECIST and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|The changes of the immunoreactivity during treatment., Peripheral blood T lymphocyte subtype, Up to 28 days|To evaluate the immunogenicity of RT-01, Antiviral antibody, Up to 28 days|To evaluate the viral shedding of RT-01, Viral RNA, Up to 24 Weeks|The Cmax of Viral RNA, The maximum RNA peak concentration, Up to 24 Weeks|The Tmax of Viral RNA, The time of maximum RNA peak concentration, Up to 24 Weeks
This is an investigator initiated , single-arm, open-label clinical pharmacology study of RT-01 as a single agent given via Intravenous injection in Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

RT-01 will be administered as a single dose on day 1 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Durvalumab will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks starting on day 5 after RT-1 on day 1 for 4 cyclesï¼Œthen followed by every 4 weeks. This study is planned to enroll 10-20 patients with Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

Considering the benefits of the subjects, the investigator deems that higher doses can be explored, then a higher-dose cohort will be carried out. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, The immunoreactivity, The immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01.
