Toripalimab Combined with Cryoablation for First-line Oligo-progression in Driver-negative Advanced NSCLC
Immunotherapy with programmed death-1(PD-1) inhibitors is now standard therapy for first-line use in patients with driver-negative advanced NSCLC, whether as single-agent or in combination with chemotherapy. After progression of first-line immunotherapy, NSCLC patients may be treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeted therapies, among others. Recently, Immune Checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) rechallenge has become a highly anticipated option. Although the objective response rate of the ICIs rechallenge patients has decreased substantially compared with the efficacy of the first ICI treatment, nearly 50% of patients can regain disease control.

Cryoablation is a minimally invasive technique that utilizes very low temperature to eliminate viable tumour cells in target tissues. It has been reported that ablation can enhance immune response.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab (PD-1) in combination with cryoablation in the treatment of oligometastatic driver-negative advanced NSCLC after first-line immunotherapy progress.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or date of death, whichever occurred first., 6 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of cases with remission (PR + CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment was assessable., 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause., 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Frequency table will be used to summarize occurrence of each treatment-emergent AE.
