Safety and Clinical Activity of Nivatrotamab in Relapsed/Recurrent Metastatic Small-cell Lung Cancer
Adult patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) will be treated with nivatrotamab a monoclonal anti GD2Ã—CD3 bispecific antibody to investigate the safety and tolerability of the drug.
SCLC
DRUG: Nivatrotamab
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Phase I, Summary of DLTs in DLT evaluable subjects., Days 1 through 28|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) for Different Doses of Nivatrotamab in Phase I, Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability., From first dose until 30 days after last IMP, up to 26 weeks. Actual duration for treated patients were from 21 to 58 days.
The study will include a phase 1 dose escalation part to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This will be conducted following a modified Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (mBOIN) design. For the purpose of dose escalation, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be collected and assessed for a period of 28 days (the DLT evaluation period).

A phase 2 dose expansion part will follow the phase 1 dose escalation. In phase 2, patients will be stratified according to whether they have platinum sensitive or platinum-resistant SCLC. Phase 2 will assess the long term safety and tolerability of nivatrotamab as well as the clinical activity of nivatrotamab when administered at the obtained MTD/RP2D in phase 1.
