Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Proteasome Inhibitor in Combination With CPX-351 for the Treatment of Newly-Diagnosed TP53-mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This is a Phase I/II study evaluating safety and efficacy of proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) in combination with CPX-351 (liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed TP53-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (TP53m AML).

The primary endpoint of the study is to define safety/tolerability (phase I) and preliminary efficacy profile (phase II) of the treatment. The secondary endpoints of interest are complete remission (CR) rate, detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) status, overall response rate (ORR), rate of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), treatment-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS), achievement of complete remission anytime in 1 year, and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year and 2 years. All the patient outcomes assessments will be performed as part of standard-of-care AML management.

The hypothesis is the combination of bortezomib and CPX-351 will have an acceptable safety profile in this patient population based on the data from previous studies. The treatment will attenuate Nuclear Factor kB pathway activation in these cells and eradicate TP53m leukemia stem cells (LSC) leading to increased response rate and survival in these patients.
