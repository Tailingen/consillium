The Evaluation of the Effectiveness, Safety and Tolerability of Treatment, Using a PSMA-Lu177, in Patients with ACC- an Open, Non-commercial Clinical Trial
Non-commercial phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of treatment using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) labeled with 177Lutetium in patients with recurrence and/or metastases in adenoid cystic carcinoma originating from the salivary glands of the head and neck region.

Patients with PSMA receptor expression confirmed by PET/CT after administration of 68Ga-PSMA I\&T will be eligible for treatment.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan
Assessment of the effectiveness of the study treatment, Objective response rate (ORR) - RECIST 1.1 score in CT examination 2 years after completion of treatment, 2 years after the end of treatment
Assessment of the effectiveness of the study treatment, Progression free survival, Time from the date of initiation of the treatment to the disease progression or death|Assessment of the effectiveness of the study treatment, Overall survival, Time from the date of initiation of the treatment to death|Assessment of the effectiveness of the study treatment, Duration of response, Time from the date of initiation of the treatment to the disease progression or death|Assessment of quality of life, Assessment of quality of life (according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H\&N43 questionnaire), Time from the the date of initiation of treatment to the disease progression or death|Assessment of safety and tolerance, Assessment of safety and tolerance of treatment according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 5.0, Time from the date of initiation of the treatment to disease progression or death
It is planned to enroll 32 patients diagnosed with non-resectable recurrence and/or dissemination in the course of ACC, whose general condition and life expectancy justify qualification for diagnosis using PSMA 68Ga and treatment with lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide-tetraxetan

The Study assumes the administration of 6 cycles of treatment (lutetium \[177Lu\] vipivotide-tetraxetan) at 6-week intervals.

If toxicity occurs, the activity of the next dose of the preparation will be modified or its next administration will be delayed by a maximum of 4 weeks.

After completing 6 cycles of therapy, the participant enters the observation phase, which will last until recurrence of the disease is diagnosed or for 2 years after the end of therapy.
