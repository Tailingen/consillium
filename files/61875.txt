Regional Database for Collecting Clinical-biological and Imaging Data "Secondary Bone Oncology and Bone Localizations of Hematologic Diseases"
Improving the effectiveness of cancer treatments makes it possible to lengthen patient survival. It is therefore important to ensure that the quality of life is also maintained by reducing pain and handicap.

Some cancers tend to spread to the bone. The bone locations of cancer can weaken the bone and lead to complications such as fractures, pain, or compression of neurological structures.

To avoid such complications, weekly multidisciplinary meetings (MM) bring together specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, cancer surgeons, radiologists, radiotherapists, etc.) to discuss the files of patients with bone lesions from cancer. They offer specific treatments adapted to each patient to treat or reduce the risk of complications. The OOSLOH study aims to collect clinical, biological, and imaging data from patients for whom a discussion took place in bone dedicated MM. Based on these data, epidemiological studies could be carried out to better understand the clinical factors leading cancer to colonize bone. But also to determine the factors making it possible to prevent or better treat bone complications and improve the quality of life of patients. This study does not require any examinations or additional visits to the patient
