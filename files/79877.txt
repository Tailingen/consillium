Real-world Resource Use and Costs of CAR-T Therapies in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): Inpatient and Outpatient Settings
A retrospective, non-interventional cohort study was used to address the study objectives. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of real-world healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and healthcare reimbursement costs associated with chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy among patients with DLBCL.
