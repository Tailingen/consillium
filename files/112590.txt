Does Obesity Increase the Risk of Conversion and Short Term Complications in Laparoscopic Rectal Surgery?
Obesity is on the rise in the Western population and BMI has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of per- and postoperative complications.

The investigators intend to study a population of more than 300 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer.

The investigators main outcome measure will be the conversion rate, and the investigators also intend to study other indications of short term complications, such as peroperative bleeding, infection, re-operation and mortality.

The investigators hypothesise that increased BMI does not increase the risk of conversion.
