Pacritinib in Patients With Endothelial Growth Factor (EGFR) Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)
The goal of the study is to find the best dose of pacritinib when given in combination with erlotinib.

Dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) - Phase I only, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.

A patient is evaluable for DLT assessment only during Cycle 1 of treatment. If the patient is not able to be treated on Day 1 of Cycle 2, then s/he is still considered in Cycle 1 active treatment and can experience a DLT. Once the patient has been treated in Cycle 2, s/he will no longer be evaluated for DLTs in all subsequent cycles., Completion of cycle 1 of all Phase I patients (estimated to be 1 year)|Response rate - Phase II only, * Partial response + complete response per RECIST 1.1 criteria
* Study terminated prior to enrolling any phase II participants
* Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
* Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters, Up to 5 years
Adverse events (toxicities), The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., 30 days post completion of treatment (estimated to be 9 months)|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of patients who achieve complete response, partial response, or stable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

* Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
* Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Up to 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease (PD) = at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, Up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause., Up to 5 years
The goal of the study is to find the best dose of pacritinib when given in combination with erlotinib.
