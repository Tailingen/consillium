A Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of Ziftomenib in Combination With Venetoclax/Azacitidine, Venetoclax, or 7+3 in Patients With AML
This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antileukemic activity of ziftomenib in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine (ven/aza), ven, and 7+3 for two different molecularly-defined arms, NPM1-m and KMT2A-r.
