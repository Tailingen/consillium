However, hand-foot syndrome induced by capecitabin will bother the patient to decrease the quality of life. S-1, an alternative of fluoropyrimidine, was proved non-inferior efficacy with lower hand-foot syndrome as first-line chemotherapy in advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma in the studies. The investigators are going to test the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus S-1 as maintenance treatment compared with bevacizumab plus capecitabin in colorectal adenocarcinoma
