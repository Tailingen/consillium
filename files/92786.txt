TACE Combined Surgery for the Resectable Huge HCC
Huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is defined as a tumor with a maximum diameter greater than 10 cm. With advancements in surgical techniques, hepatectomy can be performed safely in some patients with huge HCC without vascular invasion or distant metastasis and with preserved liver function. The high risk of recurrence after surgery is another challenge for surgeons. Neoadjuvant TACE has been shown to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with HCC, especially those with a high risk of recurrence, such as those with multinodular tumors, large tumors, and tumor thrombus. The present multicenter study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant TACE in patients with huge HCC who underwent liver resection.

PROCEDURE: TACE|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Recurrence-free survival （RFS）, RFS was defined as the time from surgery to tumor progression or the last follow-up, 24 months
Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from surgery to death or the last follow-up, 60 months
Huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is defined as a tumor with a maximum diameter greater than 10 cm. With advancements in surgical techniques, hepatectomy can be performed safely in some patients with huge HCC without vascular invasion or distant metastasis and with preserved liver function. However, the 2-year recurrence rate in such cases is as high as 70%, indicating the need for more effective interventions to improve outcomes. Neoadjuvant TACE has been shown to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with HCC, especially those with a high risk of recurrence, such as those with multinodular tumors, large tumors, and tumor thrombus. The impact of neoadjuvant TACE on the long-term oncological outcomes of huge HCC requires investigation. The present multicenter study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant TACE in patients with huge HCC who underwent liver resection.
