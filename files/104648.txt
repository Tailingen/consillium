An Observational Study of Predictors and Outcomes of Lung Cancer in Never-smokers in the UK
The goal of this observational study is to improve the early detection of lung cancer in adults who have smoked less than 100 tobacco cigarettes ("never-smokers") in the United Kingdom. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* To describe characteristics such as demographics, co-morbidities and environmental exposures
* To describe participant pathways including presentation mode and symptoms to understand if earlier diagnosis would be possible
* To describe participant outcomes such as cancer stage, treatment and mortality
* To quantitatively or qualitatively measure modifiable and non-modifiable factors that may be associated with LCINS including environmental measures, blood tests and genomic data.

Participants will currently have no change to their usual care.
Lung Cancer
Demographics, comorbidities and environmental exposures of participants, From review of electronic health records, Comorbidities and environmental exposures at diagnosis (approximately up to 156 weeks prior to diagnosis)|Participant pathways including presentation mode and symptoms, From review of electronic health records, Presentation mode and symptoms at time of diagnosis (approximately up to 52 weeks prior to diagnosis)
Participant outcomes such as cancer stage, treatment, mortality, From review of electronic health records, Cancer stage at time of diagnosis, treatment and mortality through study completion (likely 5 years)|Measurement of modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with LCINS, To be determined, Through study completion (likely 5 years)
