A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TSL-1502 Capsules in Breast Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA Mutations
This research study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of TSL-1502 capsules in patients with breast cancer, will be included HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations.
Breast Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: TSL-1502 capsules(low dose)|DRUG: TSL-1502 capsules(high dose)|DRUG: Investigator's choice of chemotherapy
Objective response rate(ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Solid tumors evaluation criteria (RECIST) version 1.1 is used for anti-tumor efficacy evaluation. For patients with PR or CR at the first evaluation, response confirmation should be performed at least 4 weeks later, Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months
Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR and stable disease (SD)., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks there after until disease progression or death due to any cause.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months|Duration of Response(DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first assessment of CR or PR to disease progression or death due to any cause., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks there after until disease progression or death due to any cause.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months|Progress Free Survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 12 Months PFS Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects without disease progression or death from any cause 12 months after the beginning of randomization or the probability estimated by Kaplan-Meier method., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks there after until disease progression or death due to any cause.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months|Overall Survival(OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks there after until disease progression or death due to any cause.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months|12 Months PFS Rate, 12 Months PFS Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects without disease progression or death from any cause 12 months after the beginning of randomization or the probability estimated by Kaplan-Meier method., Radiological scans performed at baseline then every 6 weeks there after until disease progression or death due to any cause.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months|Safety endpoints, all AEs and SAEs by CTCAE v5.0, From screening until final visit.Assessed up to a maximum of 40 months
Cmax, Plasma concentrations for TSL-1502 and TSL-1502M will be analyzed to determine the maximum observed concentration, Cycle1(Day1、Day8、Day14 and Day21)|Cmin, Plasma concentrations for TSL-1502 and TSL-1502M will be analyzed to determine the minimum observed concentration, Cycle1(Day1、Day8、Day14 and Day21)|AUC0-t, Plasma concentrations for TSL-1502 and TSL-1502M will be analyzed to determine the area under the curve (AUC)., Cycle1(Day1、Day8、Day14 and Day21)
Background:

Breast cancer is a collective term for a variety of malignant breast tumors.According to the World Cancer Report newly released by the World Health Organization in February 2020, breast cancer ranks first in the causes of death among women due to cancer worldwide, with about 2.1 million new cases and 627,000 deaths in 2018. At present, the main treatments for breast cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy, but the therapeutic effect is limited. The 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced breast cancer is only 20%, and the overall survival (OS) is 2 \~ 3 years.

Research basis:

Tumor cells can activate their own DNA repair machinery to repair DNA damage caused by drugs and thus become resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while there is overexpression of DNA repair enzymes in a variety of tumor cells. Therefore, reducing the expression of DNA repair enzymes or inhibiting their activity may exert latent anti-tumor effects.

Specific aims:

To evaluate the objective response rate at least 4 weeks later,disease control rate,duration of response,progression-free survival and objective response rate and overall survival in patients withHER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations. Also we plan to estimate safety endpoints and PK endpoints in this subject population.

Treatment plan:

Patients will be randomized in three arms. In arm A , patients will be treated with low dose TSL-1502 capsules, 350 mg each time, orally administered QD, every 3 weeks as a treatment cycle. In arm B , patients will be treated with the same interference with high dose,500 mg each time, orally administered QD, every 3 weeks as a treatment cycle. In arm B , patients will be treated with investigator's choice of chemotherapy.
