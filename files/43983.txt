The Effectiveness of an Online Support Group in Enhancing Recovery Identity and Health-Related Quality of Life
Background Ovarian cancer poses challenges for middle-aged and older patients, impacting physical and self-conceptual aspects. A research gap exists on the impact of online support groups (SPs) on identity synthesis and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) for these patients.

Objective To assess the feasibility and efficacy of an online SG in influencing recovery identity and HRQOL in middle-aged and older ovarian cancer patients (MDOCP).

Method A four-week randomized controlled trial, followed by a three-month evaluation, was conducted, employing a mobile online SG and an offline SG both grounded in The Social Identity Model of Identity Change. Recovery identity, HRQOL, and participant engagement were utilized to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of interventions.

BEHAVIORAL: mobile online support group (experiment group)|BEHAVIORAL: offline support group (control group)
Illness identity, The acceptance of illness identity was measured using the Illness Identity Questionnaire's acceptance sub-scale, consisting of 6 items (Oris et al., 2016)., Data collection occurred at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at a three-month follow-up|Maintenance of identity, The maintenance of former social identities was measured using the Maintenance of Group Memberships sub-scale of Exeter Identity Transition Scales (Haslam et al., 2008), encompassing 4 items., Data collection occurred at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at a three-month follow-up|New identity, The new meaningful social identity was measured using the New Group Memberships sub-scale of the Exeter Identity Transition Scales, which includes 4 questions. Responses were rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of acceptance of the identity., Data collection occurred at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at a three-month follow-up
Health related quality of life, Health related quality of life was measured using the Short Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12) (Jakobusson, 2007), which includes twelve questions. Each item is transformed into a scale ranging from 0 to 100 according to a specific scoring algorithm. These scores are then aggregated to generate two summary scores: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). The resulting scores are norm-based, comparing an individual's health status to population norms. Health related quality of life is calculate as the summary of PCS and MCS. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life, with scores around 50 representing the average., Data collection occurred at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at a three-month follow-up
