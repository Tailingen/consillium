Incidence and Mortality
Most tumors of the paranasal sinuses present with advanced disease,
and cure rates are generally poor (≤50%).  Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequent
type of malignant tumor in the nose and paranasal sinuses (70%–80%). 
Papillomas are distinct entities that may undergo malignant degeneration.  The
cancers grow within the bony confines of the sinuses and are often asymptomatic
until they erode and invade adjacent structures.[

Nodal involvement is
infrequent.  Metastases from both  the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses may occur, and distant metastases are found in 20% to 40% of
patients who do not respond to treatment. However, locoregional recurrence accounts for most cancer deaths because most patients die of direct extension into vital areas of the skull or of
rapidly recurring local disease.
Cancers of the maxillary sinus are the most common of the paranasal sinus
cancers.  Tumors of the ethmoid sinuses, nasal vestibule, and nasal cavity are
less common, and tumors of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are rare.
Anatomy
The major lymphatic drainage route of the maxillary antrum is through the
lateral and inferior collecting trunks to the first station submandibular,
parotid, and jugulodigastric nodes and through the superoposterior trunk to
retropharyngeal and jugular nodes.
Clinical Evaluation and Follow-Up
Pretreatment evaluation and staging, as well as the need for
multidisciplinary planning of treatment, is very important.  Generally, the
first opportunity to treat patients with head and neck cancers is the most
effective, although salvage surgery or salvage radiation therapy,
as appropriate, may occasionally be successful.
Because most treatment failures occur
within 2 years, patients must be monitored frequently and meticulously
during this period.  Lifetime follow-up is essential because nearly 33% of these patients
develop second primary cancers in the aerodigestive tract.
Carcinogenesis and Risk Factors
Data indicate that various industrial exposures may be related to cancer
of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity.  The risk of a second primary head and
neck tumor is considerably increased.[
4
] A study has shown that a subgroup of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity SCCs are associated with human papilloma  virus (HPV) infection and that HPV-positive patients   may have a better prognosis than those who are HPV negative.[

Cellular Classification of Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer
The most common cell type for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers is
squamous cell carcinoma.  Minor salivary gland tumors comprise 10% to 15% of
these neoplasms.  Malignant melanoma presents in less than 1% of neoplasms in
this region.  Some 5% of cases are  malignant lymphomas.[
1
,
2
]
Esthesioneuroepithelioma, sometimes confused with undifferentiated carcinoma or
undifferentiated lymphoma, arises from the olfactory nerves.[
3
]
Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and most soft tissue sarcomas
have been reported for this region.
Inverting papilloma is considered a low-grade benign tumor with a tendency to
recur and, in a small percentage of cases, to transform into a malignant tumor.
Midline granuloma, a progressively destructive condition, also involves this region.

Stage Information for Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer
In This Section
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The staging systems are clinical estimates of the extent of disease.  The
assessment of the tumor is based on inspection, palpation, and direct endoscopy
when necessary.  The tumor must be confirmed histologically, and any other
pathological data obtained on biopsy may be included.  The appropriate nodal
drainage areas are examined by careful palpation.  Computed tomographic and/or
magnetic resonance imaging studies are generally required to adequately
evaluate tumor extent before surgical resection or definitive
radiation therapy.  If a patient's disease relapses, complete restaging must be done to select the appropriate additional therapy.[

American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
Staging for nasal cavity and paranasal sinus carcinomas is not as well
established as staging for other head and neck tumors.  For cancer of the maxillary sinus, the nasal cavity,  and the ethmoid sinus, the
AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. Lymphomas, sarcomas, and mucosal melanomas of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity are not staged using this system.[
3
] The staging described below is used only for patients who have not had a lymph node dissection of the neck.

Treatment Option Overview for Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer
In This Section
Surgery
Radiation Therapy
Recurrent Disease
Fluorouracil dosing
Except for patients with T1 mucosal carcinomas, the accepted method of treatment is a
combination of radiation therapy and surgery.  The incidence of lymph node
metastases is generally low (approximately 20% of cases).  Thus, routine
radical neck dissection or elective neck radiation therapy is recommended only for
patients presenting with positive nodes.
For patients with operable tumors,
radical surgery is generally performed first to remove the bulk of the tumor
and to establish drainage of the affected sinus(es).  This is followed by
postoperative radiation therapy.  Some institutions continue to give a full
dose of radiation therapy preoperatively for all patients with stage II and stage III tumors and
operate 4 to 6 weeks later.[
1
-
3
]  A review of published clinical results of
radical radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suggested a significant loss
of local control with prolonged radiation therapy;
therefore, lengthening of standard treatment schedules should be avoided
whenever possible.[
4
]
Surgery
Surgical exploration may be required to determine operability.
Relative contraindications to surgery include destruction of
the base of the skull (i.e., anterior cranial fossa), cavernous sinus, or the pterygoid
process; infiltration of the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx; or
nonresectable lymph node metastases. 
Surgical approaches include fenestration with removal of the bulk tumor, which
is usually followed by radiation therapy or block resection of the upper jaw. 
A combined craniofacial approach, including resection of the floor of the
anterior cranial fossa, has been used with success in selected patients.[
5
]  Removal of
the eye is performed if the orbit is extensively invaded by cancer.  Clinically
positive nodes, if resectable, may be treated with radical neck dissection.
Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy must be carried to high doses for any significant probability
of permanent control.  The treatment volume must include all of the maxillary
antrum and involved hemiparanasal sinus and contiguous areas.  The orbit and
its contents are excluded except under unusual circumstances.  Lymph nodes of
the neck, when palpable, should be treated in conjunction with treatment of
advanced carcinomas of the antrum.  This may be unnecessary for early tumors.
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a high incidence (>30%–40%) of
hypothyroidism in patients who have received external-beam radiation therapy to the
entire thyroid gland or to the pituitary gland.  Thyroid function testing of
patients should be considered prior to therapy and as part of posttreatment
follow-up.[
6
,
7
]
Recurrent Disease
Patients with recurrent disease should consider chemotherapy clinical trials. 
Chemotherapy for recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck has been
shown to be efficacious as palliation and may improve a patient's quality of life and
length of survival.  Various drug combinations, including cisplatin,
fluorouracil, and methotrexate, are effective.[
8
,
9
]
Treatment of tumors of the paranasal sinuses and of the nasal cavity should be
planned on an individual basis because of the complexity involved.
Fluorouracil dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
10
,
11
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
10
-
12
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
13
-
15
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
16
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy as used in clinical trials has been used to shrink
tumors and to render them more definitively treatable with either surgery
or radiation therapy.  This chemotherapy is given before the other modalities; therefore, 
the designation of
neoadjuvant
is used to distinguish it from standard adjuvant therapy,
which is given after or during definitive therapy with radiation or after
surgery.  Many drug combinations have been used in  neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.[
