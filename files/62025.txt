Gene Molecular Alterations as Disease Prognostic Markers in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
GEMA-proN is an observational, multicenter, single cohort, retrospective clinical trial. The aim of the trial is to assess the prevalence, and prognostic value of genetic molecular alterations and investigate correlations with clinicopathological features in unselected patients with histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer)
OS (overall survival) in whole cohort., Overall survival is defined from the date of initial diagnosis until death or last contact., Through study completion, 3 years.
Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who received 1st line treatment for metastatic non-small cell ling cancer (NSCLC)., Progression-free survival is defined from the date of 1st line treatment initiation until the date of radiologically confirmed disease progression (PD), following 1st line treatment., Through study completion, 3 years.|Recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients who underwent surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Recurrence-free survival is defined from the date of initial surgical diagnosis until the date of radiologically confirmed disease recurrence, following surgical resection., Through study completion, 3 years.
Prevalence of somatic gene alterations., Assessment of the prevalence of detected pathogenic/ likely pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), translocations, and co-mutations., Through study completion, 3 years.|Prognostic value of assessed somatic gene molecular alterations., Assessment of the prognostic value of detected pathogenic/ likely pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), translocations, and co-mutations., Through study completion, 3 years|Prognostic value of assessed PD-L1 expression., Assessment of the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression., Through study completion, 3 years.|Prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)., Assessment of the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)., Through study completion, 3 years.
This a non- interventional, multicenter, retrospective one arm trial assessing patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received treatment in 18 Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG)- affiliated centers in Greece between 2000 and 2020. Molecular genetic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, copy number alterations, and translocations, are detected with next generation sequencing using the ForeSENTIAÂ® NSCLC panel developed by NIPD Genetics. The aim of the trial is to assess the prevalence and prognostic value of molecular alterations in the study population.
