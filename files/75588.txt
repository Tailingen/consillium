PET/MRI in CNS and Extra-CNS Tumors of Patients With Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)
This prospective pilot study is designed to provide preliminary data on the use of Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FDG-PET-MRI) in patients with neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) associated optic glioma and plexiform neurofibroma (PN).

Subjects will undergo FDG-PET-MRI scans in place of standard of care imaging at 0 and 12 months, unless more frequent imaging is clinically indicated. Subjects and their family caregivers will also undergo serial interviews and complete questionnaires related to the psychosocial aspects of NF1.
