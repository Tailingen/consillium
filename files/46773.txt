MSB0010445 and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Advanced Melanoma
This is a Phase 2a, open-label, parallel group, partly randomized dose escalation trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a low dose, an intermediate dose, and high dose MSB0010445 given by intravenous infusion to subjects with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

DRUG: MSB0010445 (0.3 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg])|DRUG: MSB0010445 (1.0 mg/kg)|DRUG: MSB0010445 (1.8 mg/kg)|DRUG: MSB0010445 (2.4 mg/kg)|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
Number of Subjects With at Least 1 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as any Grade\>= 3 toxicity related to drug, occurring during 21 days post first dose of drug except Grade 3 infusion-related adverse reaction resolving within 6 hours and Transient (\<=6 hours) Grade 3 flu-like symptoms/fever controlled with medical management; Transient (\<= 24 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, emesis that resolved to \<= Grade 1; Grade 3 skin toxicity ,Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \< 8 x upper limit of normal (ULN)/total bilirubin \< 5 x ULN resolving to \<= Grade 1 in \<7 days after medical management; Grade 3 diarrhea controlled with maximal medical management within 72 hours; Grade 4 lymphopenia that resolves to \<= Grade 1 within 7 days \& with no clinical manifestations; Grade 3 lab abnormality with no clinical correlation and resolves to \<= Grade 1 within 7 days with adequate medical management Tumor flare defined as local pain, irritation or rash localized at sites of known/suspected tumor., Baseline up to Day 21
Number of Subjects With Best Overall Response (BOR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, BOR was defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during second-line treatment. For target lesions (TLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline SLD. For non-target lesions (NTLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels., Screening up to 28 days after last dose of drug; assessed up to maximum of 1.41 years|Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious AEs, TEAE was defined as an AE that started on or after the first administration of SBRT. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/ significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect., Screening up to 28 days after last dose of drug; assessed up to maximum of 1.41 years
