Adenoviral Vector Monotherapy or Combination With Chemotherapy in Subjects With Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer.
Phase II, randomized, safety and efficacy study in recurrent/metastatic breast cancer with accessible lesions.

Primary End point is rate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) at the 16 week treatment time point. Hypothesis: Adenoviral vector (Ad-RTS-hIL-12) alone and in combination with chemotherapy (palifosfamide) is safe and efficacious.
Breast Cancer Nos Metastatic Recurrent
GENETIC: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and Veledimex|DRUG: Palifosfamide
Safety and tolerability of study drug therapy based on type and rate of adverse events and 16-week PFS rate., Approximately 24 weeks-Beginning from the time a patient signs the informed consent to the Follow up Tumor Assessment visit
Objective response rate (ORR) by modified RECIST v1.1, Proportion of subjects achieving a confirmed PR or CR according to modified RECIST v1.1, Approximately 24 weeks- From first study drug dose to Follow-Up Tumor Assessment Visit|Clinical Benefit rate: proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD by modified RECIST v1.1, Approximately 24 weeks|Estimate PFS by modified RECIST v1.1, Approximately 24 weeks, beginning at the first study drug administratrion and ending at the Follow up Tumor Assessment visit|Evaluate Pharmacodynamic tumor markers in tumor tissue samples that may correlate with objective tumor response and/or clinical outcome, Approximately 24 weeks, starting with first study drug administrationa and ending at the Follow up Tumor Assessment visit
Multicenter, open-label, randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of INXN-1001 (veledimex) and INXN-2001 (Ad-RTS-hIL-12) alone and in combination with palifosfamide.

Part 1 is the safety run-in where a safety assessment will be made after 1 cycle of therapy.

Part 2, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to active treatment Arms A or C.

Once the monotherapy (Arm A) is determined to be safe and tolerable, Part 1 combination therapy (Arm C) will begin.

Subjects should receive six cycles of study treatment, in the absence of meeting withdrawal criteria.
