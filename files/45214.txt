A Study of Oral MBQ-167 in Participants With Advanced Breast Cancer
A Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial of MBQ-167 in participants with advanced Breast Cancer for whom Standard of Care (SOC) has failed or has proven intolerable.
Breast Cancer|Breast Neoplasm|Breast Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: MBQ-167
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MBQ-167 as a single agent administered orally, BID continuously for 21 days in participants with Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) by evaluating for the presence or absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) related to MBQ-167 administered in cohorts of participants at escalating sequential cohort dose levels., 21 days
MBQ-167 PK parameter (Cmax/min), Maximum and minimum observed plasma concentration at steady state, 56 days|MBQ-167 PK parameter (tmax), Time to maximum plasma concentration, 56 days|MBQ-167 PK parameter (t1/2), Terminal elimination half-life, 56 days|MBQ-167 PK parameter (AUC (0-t,0-24,âˆž)), Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval time from time 0, 56 days|MBQ-167 PD parameter (differential gene expression), Observed quantitative measurement of gene expression change from baseline, 16 days|MBQ-167 PK/PD parameter (minimum dose for therapeutic response), Correlate differential gene expression change, objective response and PK parameter Cmax/min to identify a minimum dose for therapeutic response, 56 days
The main questions this clinical trial aims to answer are:

* What, if any, are the side effects of different dose levels in humans?
* What is the maximum tolerated dose?
* How does the human body process the drug?
* Does the drug slow, stop or eliminate cancer in human participants?

Participants will be asked to:

* provide informed consent
* be evaluated by physicians and provide laboratory specimens to determine if eligible
* take MBQ-167 orally twice a day for at least 21 days
* may continue dosing, if safe to do so, until not effective or other decision to stop is made
* participate in multiple visits that include additional evaluations, laboratory tests and diary review until after stopping the investigational drug
