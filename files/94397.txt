Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Vi-sealer
This study's primary goal is to compare the efficacy and safety of the novel advanced hemostatic device(AHD), Vi-Sealer, with conventional AHDs in laparoscopic total hysterectomy for patients with benign gynecologic neoplasm.
Benign Gynecologic Neoplasm
DEVICE: Vi-Sealer|DEVICE: Ligasure|DEVICE: Other AHD
Operative procedure time, Measure the time consumed from the initial skin incision to the closure of abdominal trocar sites, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Estimated blood loss, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Estimated medical cost of device, Medical costs according to hemostatic instrument use, within 6 weeks after intervention|Device evaluation score, Ergonomics and subjective hemostatic performances assessed by surgeons using the survey, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adverse events, Collect only for adverse events that have a relationship with medical devices for clinical trials, within 6 weeks after intervention
Vi-Sealer is a reusable advanced bipolar electrode with an interchangeable blade. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the Vi-Sealer by comparing it with other advanced hemostatic devices, such as Ligasure, Enseal, Thunderbeat, Harmonic scalpel, etc. The economic evaluation of the device compared with other disposable devices would also be conducted.
