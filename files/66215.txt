A Tailored Screening and Smoking Cessation Program for the LGBTQ Community of Seattle
This clinical trial develops a tailored screening and smoking cessation program for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (trans) and queer (LGBTQ) community of Seattle, Washington. A lung cancer screening program may help LGTBQ people who smoke overcome unique barriers that keep them from receiving preventive care, and constantly facing healthcare discrimination. Members of the LGBTQ community have historically smoked at higher rates than the general population and thus could benefit greatly from targeted efforts to improve lung cancer screening and smoking cessation implementation.

OUTLINE:

AIM 1: Stakeholders (community organization leaders, medical providers of LGBTQ patients, and LGBTQ community members and tobacco users) participate in an interview over 45 minutes to 1 hour.

AIM 2: Participants participate in focus groups over 1-1.5 hours.

AIM 3: Participants receive a patient navigation intervention consisting of a series of points of contact (mostly via telephone) between the patient navigator/tobacco treatment specialist (PN/TTS) and includes: 1) An introduction and enrollment in LCS, 2) facilitation of a shared decision-making (SDM) visit with the LCS-dedicated nurse practitioner, 3) individual assessment of barriers and facilitators to in-person low-dose CT screening, 4) explanation of results and needed follow-up, and 5) follow-up reminders. Participants also undergo carbon monoxide measurement by exhaling into a disposable monitor for 10 seconds at the initial visit and the post-intervention visit. The PN may also provide an intervention for smoking cessation.

After completion of Aim 3 study intervention, participants are followed up at 3 months.
