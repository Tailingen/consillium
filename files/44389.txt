This Phase IIb study will be conducted at centres in several European countries according to a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind design. It will provide information about the clinical and immunological efficacy and the tolerability of GSK 249553 when this is administered to patients with stage IB, II NSCLC. The study treatment will be administered by intramuscular injection; first administration will take place 4-6 weeks after surgery. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
