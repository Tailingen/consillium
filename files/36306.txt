DRUG: Olaparib|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified RECIST 1.1 in Biomarker Subgroups, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The ORR for all participants will be presented by biomarker subgroup., Up to ~3 years
Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 in Biomarker Subgroups, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR for all participants who experience a CR or PR will be presented by biomarker subgroup., Up to ~3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 in Biomarker Subgroups, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more lesions is also considered PD. The PFS for all participants will be presented by biomarker subgroup., Up to ~3 years|Overall Survival (OS) in Biomarker Subgroups, OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The OS for all participants will be presented by biomarker subgroup., Up to ~3 years|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to ~3 years|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment will be presented., Up to ~3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Tumor Biomarker Status as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 in Additional Biomarker Subpopulations, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. ORR will be presented by biomarker subpopulation., Up to ~3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Based on Tumor Biomarker Status as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 in Additional Biomarker Subpopulations, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR for all participants who experience a CR or PR will be presented by biomarker subpopulation., Up to ~3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Tumor Biomarker Status as Assessed by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 in Additional Biomarker Subpopulations, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more lesions is also considered PD. PFS will be presented by biomarker subpopulation., Up to ~3 years|Overall Survival (OS) in Additional Biomarker Subpopulations, OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS will be presented by biomarker subpopulation., Up to ~3 years|Number of Participants with Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) Level of ≥2 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) Among Participants with Ovarian Cancer, The number of participants who have ovarian cancer and have a CA-125 level ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at 2 different assessments that are measured at least 1 week apart will be presented., Up to ~3 years|Number of Participants with Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) Level ≥2 × Nadir (Lowest) Value Among Participants with Ovarian Cancer Who Had Elevated CA-125 Levels ≥ULN at Baseline, The number of participants who have ovarian cancer with an elevated CA-125 level ≥ ULN at Baseline and have a CA-125 level ≥2 × the nadir (lowest) value at 2 different assessments that are measured at least 1 week apart will be presented., Up to ~3 years|Number of Participants with a Change from Baseline in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Level of ≥50% Among Participants with Prostate Cancer, A PSA response is defined as a reduction in the PSA level of ≥50% from Baseline measured at 2 different times at least 3 weeks apart. The number of participants who have prostate cancer and have a change from Baseline in PSA level ≥50% will be presented., Up to ~3 years
