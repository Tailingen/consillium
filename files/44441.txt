Trail Evaluating Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (3 GyE Per Fraction) for Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with the fraction size of 3 gray equivalent (GyE) in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the MTD in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT)
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Time interval from the start of CIRT to 4 months after the completion of CIRT
Overall survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of local recurrence of NPC, a median of 2 years|Progression-free survival of all patients, From the completion of CIRT, a median of 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with the fraction size of 3 GyE in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 54GyE (3GyE/daily fraction) to potentially 63GyE (3GyE/daily fraction) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion of CIRT. The classic 3+3 method is used for the phase I dose escalating part of the trial and approximately 4-18 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the trial will be a single phase single arm study.
