A Trial of Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with DNA Repair Defects
This study is designed to evaluate the initial safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug, niraparib, given to patients who have recently received platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. The study enrolls participants with history of advanced prostate cancer that is growing despite standard hormonal therapies, such as androgen-deprivation therapy.
