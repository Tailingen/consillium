Short-Course Radiotherapy Followed by Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, HLX07and Serplulimab in LARC
The study is a multicenter, open-label, phase II clinical study, and the purpose of the study is to explore the complete response rate (CR, Defined as pathological complete response (pCR) + Clinical complete response (cCR)) of patients with RAS/BRAF wild type locally advanced rectal cancer(LARC) treated with short-term radiotherapy, sequential HLX07, Serplulimab and CAPOX. A total of 29 patients were included in this study.
Rectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: HLX07(anti EGFR antibody) and Serplulimab(anti PD-1 antibody)
complete response (CR) rate, Defined as pathological complete response (pCR) + Clinical complete response (cCR), an expected average of 12 months
3-year disease-Free Survival, The time from the first day of disease free (operation date) to local or distant recurrence, or the death event caused by any reason, whichever occurs first, an expected average of 3 years|Overall Survival, The time from the date of randomization to the death caused by any cause, an expected average of 5 years|dverse events (AEs) were graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5Â·0, Adverse events and surgical safety, an expected average of 1.5 years
Patients with RAS/BRAF wild type locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-4/N+) , combined risk factors, will be treated with neoadjuvant therapy, and the Primary endpoint of the study is complete response rate(CR, Defined as pathological complete response (pCR) + Clinical complete response (cCR) ). PCR assessed by the blind independent review committee (BIRC), defined as the absence of viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0). CCR evaluation was based on a combination of digital rectal examination, endoscopy, rectal MRI and blood carcinoembryonic antigen levels.
