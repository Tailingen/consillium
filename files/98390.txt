Thymalfasin-based PRaG Mode for Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II investigator-initiated trial of precise thymalfasin-regulated therapy combined with hypofractionated radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor sequential GM-CSF for treatment of advanced refractory solid tumors.

Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial (PR) or complete response (CR) to therapy among the total number of evaluable patients., 24 months
Disease control rate (DCR), the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), The time from commencement of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause., 24 months|Overall survival (OS), The time from the first day of enrollment to death from any cause., 24 months|Incidence of adverse events, the rate of AE, 24 months
One cycle of activation cycle includes： Loading dose with thymalfasin was administrated based on the absolute number of T lymphocytes.

Radiotherapy (5 or 8Gy three fractions)was administrated to a metastatic lesion.

GM-CSF 200ug was subcutaneous injected for seven days from the first day of radiotherapy PD-1/L1 inhibitor was intravenous injected within one week after radiotherapy.

At least two activation cycles were administrated. Then maintenance treatment includes： Loading dose with thymalfasin was administrated based on the absolute number of T lymphocytes.

GM-CSF 200ug was subcutaneous injected for seven days. PD-1/L1 inhibitor was intravenous injected.
