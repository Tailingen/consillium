Idiotype Vaccine After Chemotherapy & Stem Cell Transplantation in Lymphoma With Failed Induction Chemotherapy
This is a compassionate use protocol for participants who failed induction chemotherapy + Vaccine on previous trials. These participants then went on to high dose BEAM chemotherapy and transplant, then received idiotype vaccine therapy at 3 months post transplant. Vaccine was given monthly x 4 series, with a fifth series given 12 weeks after the fourth. Participants were then followed annually until progression or death with standard staging.
