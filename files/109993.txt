A Phase I/II Study of Lenalidomide in Combination With Gemcitabine in Patients With Untreated Advanced Carcinoma of the Pancreas
Phase I will determine the MDT and evaluate the safety profile of oral lenalidomide days 1-21 and weekly gemcitabine days 1, 8, \& 15 in 28 day cycles Phase II will explore the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma. Subjects will receive oral lenalidomide days 1-21 and weekly gemcitabine days 1, 8, \& 15 in 28 day cycles until documented disease progression occurs.
