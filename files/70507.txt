A Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine vs Placebo in Combination With Rituximab and Bendamustine in Subjects With Previously-Treated Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (BRAVURA)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (DBR) vs placebo in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (PBR) in subjects with previously-treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), From date of enrollment until the date of first documentation of progression or date of death from any cause, whatever came first, assessed up to 78 months
Complete Response (CRR), Every 3-6 Cycles (each cycle is 28 days) from date of randomization, until date of first documented progression. Subjects will be evaluated for progression through the primary analysis of the study or 5 years from randomization, whichever is later.|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Every 3-6 Cycles (each cycle is 28 days) from date of randomization, until date of first documented progression. Subjects will be evaluated for progression through the primary analysis of the study or 5 years from randomization, whichever is later.|Overall Survival (OS), Every 6 months for up to 5 years from date of randomization|Duration of Response (DOR), Every 3-6 Cycles (each cycle is 28 days) from date of randomization, until date of first documented progression. Subjects will be evaluated for progression through the primary analysis of the study or 5 years from randomization, whichever is later.|Safety (Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in safety laboratory values), Continuous from informed consent until 30 days from last dose|Pharmacokinetics (PK), Evaluate the Duvelisib concentration in plasma sample., Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK), Evaluate IPI-656 (metabolite) concentration in plasma sample., Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
Study IPI-145-22 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm Phase 3 study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of DBR vs PBR in subjects with previously-treated iNHL (including follicular lymphoma \[FL\], small lymphocytic lymphoma \[SLL\] and marginal zone lymphoma \[MZL\]).

Approximately 600 subjects will receive 25 mg of duvelisib or placebo, orally BID for 28 day continuous cycles, in combination with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab given on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 and 90 mg/m2 of bendamustine given on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycles 1-6. Subjects will receive duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
