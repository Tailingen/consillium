Tolerance and Efficacy of Pembrolizumab or Cetuximab Combined With RT in Patients With Locally Advanced HNSCC
The general aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and the tolerance profile of Pembrolizumab + RT in comparison to cetuximab + RT in patients with locally advanced HNSCC and to explore potential correlations between treatment outcome and the immune landscape.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cetuximab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Locoregional Control, To compare between the 2 arms the rate of patients achieving Locoregional Control (LRC) at 15 months from the end of radiation therapy, 15 months from the end of radiation therapy
Progression free survival, Minimum time from randomization to progression/relapse at any site (local, regional or distant) as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria or to death from any cause. Patients who don't have any of these events are censored at the date of last follow-up., At 24 months after treatment initiation|Locoregional progression and distant metastasis, To estimate the respective contribution of locoregional progression, distant progression and death as first event in the progression-free survival, the cumulative incidences of these three types of events were calculated within a competing risk framework., At 24 months after treatment initiation|Overall survival, Time to death from any cause measured from randomization., At 24 months after treatment initiation|Acute adverse events, According to NCI-CTCAE version 4, the maximal grade of each toxicity observed during immune-radiotherapy will be used. All grades of toxicity will be tabulated by type of toxicity and by treatment arm., At 24 months after treatment initiation|Delayed toxicity According to RTOG late toxicity scale, According to RTOG late toxicity scale, At 24 months after treatment initiation|Duration of the feeding tube dependence, It will be presented by treatment arm and analysed by Student t-test., At 24 months after treatment initiation|Compliance to Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab, Insufficient compliance to cetuximab or Pembrolizumab is defined as a patient receiving less than 75% of the planned dose, even if the dose reduction is due to toxicity, At 24 months after treatment initiation|Health related quality of life (QL), Assessment by EORTC QLQ-C30 and H\&N35 questionnaires, At 24 months after treatment initiation|Impact of p16 / HPV tumor status on the efficacy of the 2 regimens in patients with oropharyngeal initial tumor, Assessment by CISH DNA method, At 24 months after treatment initiation
A majority of HNSCC are locally advanced and commonly treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT). However, a large proportion of patients with locally advanced stage are not suitable for receiving cisplatinum-based chemotherapy (CT) concomitant with radiotherapy (RT) either due to age, general and/or medical condition(s).

An alternative standard treatment has been established, combining RT and cetuximab.

However, both CT-RT and cetuximab-RT which are considered as standard approaches in locally advanced non operated HNSCC are associated with poor outcome in patients with the most advanced T stage (T4) and/or N stage (\>=N2) and/or HPV negative tumours. A new and promising approach could target immune response.

Pembrolizumab is a high-affinity monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody which showed antitumor activity in melanoma and NSCLC. In the KEYNOTE-012 (multi-center, nonrandomized Phase Ib HNSCC), Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and safe with no serious drug related AEs reported. About 51% (26/51) of patients had decreased tumor burden which was seen both in HPV (-) and HPV(+) HNSCC.

This observation led to the hypothesis generated in the current study that Pembrolizumab is potentially a very active drug in HNSCC and that the combination of Pembrolizumab with radiotherapy will be well tolerated, given the very good toxicity profile of the drug and will improve the outcome of patients with locally advanced HNSCC non suitable for CT-RT, as compared to the treatment of reference combining cetuximab and RT.
