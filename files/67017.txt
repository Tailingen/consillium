the Effect of Broken Ganoderma Lucidum Spore Powder on Quality of Life and Immune Function in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma After Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of broken Ganoderma lucidum spore powder on improving the quality of life and immune recovery of patients after chemotherapy. Objective To observe the adjuvant treatment with broken wall Ganoderma lucidum spore powder in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after standard chemotherapy according to NCCN guidelines. To evaluate and compare the immunoglobulin (IGA, IgM, IgG), T cell subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD4 + / CD8 +), Th1 / Th2 cytokine determination, quality of life score, leukocyte recovery rate, infection rate, infection rate To evaluate the effect of Ganoderma lucidum spore powder in improving the quality of life and immune function of patients after chemotherapy. At the same time, the liver and kidney function and adverse drug events were closely monitored during the study to explore the clinical safety of wall broken Ganoderma lucidum spore powder as adjuvant drug.
