Vaccine Plus Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have advanced melanoma. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Melanoma vaccine plus interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells
Recurrent Melanoma|Stage IV Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Clinical response rate (CR or PR), From the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to 3 years
Response duration, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate duration of response., Up to 3 years|Progression-free intervals, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate time to progression., Up to 3 years|Immunologic response rate using ELISPOT assay, Described in terms of frequency and kinetics. Agreement between clinical and immunological response will be measured using the kappa coefficient., Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine clinical response rates in patients with advanced melanoma treated with gp100:209-217(210M) melanoma vaccine and low-dose interleukin-2.

II. Assess response duration and progression-free intervals in these patients receiving this treatment.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and interleukin-2 SC on days 1-5 and 8-13. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional courses after achieving CR.

Patients are followed every 9 weeks for 3 years or until disease recurrence.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
