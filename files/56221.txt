Venetoclax and Azacitidine for Non-Elderly Adult Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study aims to treat non-elderly adult patients, who were previously untreated for acute myeloid leukemia, using venetoclax and azacitidine.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax
Response Rate, measured by the European Leukemia Net definition: (CRMRD-+CR+CRi+MLFS), The (CRMRD-+CR+CRi+MLFS) shows non-inferiority of venetoclax with azacitidine when compared with historical controls who received induction chemotherapy., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years
Incidence of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Responses, Number of new cases of Complete Remission, Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery, or Morphologic Leukemia Free State. This will be measure by multi-dimensional flow cytometry with a sensitivity to 0.1%., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years|Remission Duration, Remission Duration will be defined as the length of time a patient does not display leukemic blasts or extramedullary disease, Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years|One Year Event Free Survival, Determined using Kaplan Meier survival analysis methods with 95% confidence intervals., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival will be defined as the time from administration of the initial doses until death from any cause. Determined using Kaplan Meier survival analysis methods with 95% confidence intervals., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Safety and tolerability analysis of azacitidine and venetoclax will be summarized by dose and severity as assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and relationship to study drug., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 4 years
This is a phase II study that seeks to treat patients ages 18-59 who have acute myeloid leukemia but have never been treated before. It will use venetoclax and azacitidine, and patients can receive up to four cycles of this medication. Depending on the level of recovery, patients will either be forced to come off study or have the option to continue the medication, receive maintenance therapy, or pursue an allogeneic stem cell transplant.
