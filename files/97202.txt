Study for Women and Men With Hormone-receptor Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This was a national, multi-center, open-label, phase IIIb trial to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with ribociclib (LEE011) plus letrozole in patients with HR+, HER2-negative advanced (recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer. Patients were treated with daily doses of 600 mg ribociclib (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule) in combination with 2.5 mg letrozole daily (continuous dosing). Dose adjustments (dose reduction or interruption) according to safety findings were allowed.

For the Kaplan-Meier estimates (%, 95% CI), the probability of survival at week 24, 48 and 72 is reported below., At Week 24, Week 48 and Week 72|Overall Survival (OS) - Median Time to Progression or Death With 95% CI [Months], Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximatley 38 months|Overall Survival (OS) - Number of Censored Participants and Number of Deaths, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximatley 38 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Kaplan-Meier Estimates (%, 95% CI), Overall response rate (ORR) is the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by RECIST 1.1., At week 24|Change From Baseline at Week 24 of Patient Reported Quality of Life (QoL) Via EORTC QLQ-C30, The QLQ-C30 is the core questionnaire of the EORTC QLQ, which has been developed for the assessment of the health-related QOL of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. Using a linear transformation to standardize the raw scores, all scores finally range from 0 to 100, where a higher score represents a higher response level, e.g., a higher ("better") level of functioning (applies to the first 6 items, items 1 to 6), but a higher ("worse") level of symptoms (applies to the last 9 items, items 7 to 15). There is no aggregated total score, i.e., all scale scores were analyzed separately., Change from Baseline to Week 24|Patient Reported Quality of Life (QoL) Via EORTC BR-23 - Change From Baseline at Week 24 (Cycle 7), To evaluate health related quality of life (QoL) via EORTC BR-23. The scoring approach for the QLQ-BR23 is identical in principle to that for the function and symptom scales / single items of the QLQ-C30, i.e., all scores finally range from 0 to 100, where a higher score represents a higher response level, e.g., a higher ("better") level of functioning, (applies to the first 4 items, items 1 to 4) but a higher ("worse") level of symptoms (applies to the last 4 items, items 5 to 8)., Baseline and Week 24 (Cycle 7)|Time to 10% Deterioration in EORTC Global Health Status, Time to 10% deterioration in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) global health status, up to approximately 10 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Adverse Events (AEs) were separated into TEAEs (defined as AEs occurring/worsening from first study drug treatment until 30 days after the last study drug treatment) and AEs in the pre-/post-treatment period., Up to Week 72
The main purpose of this study was to collect additional efficacy and safety data for the combination of ribociclib and letrozole in a patient population broader than the MONALEESA-2 study (NCT01958021 / CLEE011A2301), and to provide access to ribociclib to patients for which available treatment options are unsatisfactory treatment alternatives until the drug is approved for this indication. Furthermore, this trial aimed to collect data for the combination of ribociclib and letrozole in the context of current local routine therapy algorithms for the treatment of metastatic and advanced breast cancer.

This multi-center, open-label, single-arm study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and quality of life for the combination of ribociclib and letrozole in a patient population than in the MONALEESA-2 study, i.e. in patients pretreated with one line of chemotherapy and/or a maximum of two lines of endocrine therapy as well as premenopausal patients, without limitations regarding the disease free interval after adjuvant therapy.

For ethical reasons no endocrine comparator drugs were investigated in this study. The duration of study treatment of 80 weeks was adequate to determine the primary, secondary and exploratory study parameters. The sample size was suitable to estimate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) in this patient population with reasonable precision.

Goserelin was used in premenopausal patients, since it was shown that ovarian suppression of estrogen release with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa) (such as goserelin) is effective in preventing relapse in premenopausal women with early stage ER+ breast cancer (Klijn et al. 2001).

The efficacy and safety of ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer vs. placebo (i.e., letrozole alone) was already demonstrated in the preceding, pivotal MONALESSA-2 study. Thus, for ethical reasons no endocrine comparator drugs were investigated in the present RIBECCA study.

Generally, the single-arm, open-label design and the broadening of the study population (compared to the pivotal MONALESSA-2 study) in the RIBECCA study was deemed appropriate to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus letrozole among breast cancer patients in a treatment setting closer to routine care. The duration of study treatment of up to 80 weeks was considered adequate to determine the primary, secondary and exploratory study parameters. Moreover, the sample size was suitable to estimate the CBR in this patient population with reasonable precision.
