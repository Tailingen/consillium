KPT-330 Plus RICE for Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma
This study evaluates the addition of selinexor (KPT-330) to RICE chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed and refractory aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma, with the goal of improved response rates (as compared to RICE chemotherapy alone).

Although aggressive B-cell lymphomas are potentially curable with front-line chemotherapy, at least one-third of patients experience progression or relapse. Second-line regimens such as rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (RICE) are administered with the goal of cytoreduction prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in eligible patients. However, half of patients who receive salvage treatment and ASCT are still not cured.

Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE compound, which is a new class of molecule. SINE compounds have been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in pre-clinical models of AML, CLL, T-ALL, and Ph+ ALL as well as B and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Preliminarily, selinexor has demonstrated promising single-agent clinical activity in patients with previously treated NHL including DLBCL, warranting further investigation. Based on promising preclinical and clinical data, selinexor is currently under evaluation in combination with chemotherapy for solid tumors.

The investigators hypothesize that the combination of selinexor plus RICE will be well-tolerated and clinically active in participants with previously treated aggressive B-cell lymphomas and propose a phase I trial to evaluate this combination. Moreover, Investigators will evaluate primary patient samples before and after selinexor to investigate the mechanisms of action of selinexor, including the mechanisms by which selinexor sensitizes cells to chemotherapy, and evaluate other novel drug combinations in aggressive B-cell lymphomas.
