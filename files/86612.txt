Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) in Patients Who Are Potential Candidates for Surgical Resection
The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the use of VRI to guide the selection of patients for lung surgery. Perfusion scintigraphy is the current method to assess the fractional contribution of lung function of the remaining lung.

The hypothesis is that VRI can determine quantitative postoperative lung function equally accurately as a quantitative perfusion scan.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Lung resection surgery
Comparison of ppo FEV1 and ppo DLCO as predicted by VRI with the values as predicted by Q scan, Prior to surgery
Comparison of ppo as predicted by each test with the actual FEV1 and DLCO at 3 months post-operative, 3 months after surgery
Primarily, VRI will be compared to perfusion (Q) scan by predicted post-operative (ppo) FEV1 and DLCO as predicted by VRI versus as predicted by Q scan. Secondary, the ppo as predicted by each test will be compared with the actual FEV1 and DLCO at 3 months post-operative; If these two methods provide similar results, VRI will be deemed an acceptable alternative to Q scan for determining patient selection for lung resection. Finally, the patient outcomes (30 day mortality and pulmonary complications) for those patients falling within guideline parameters using the VRI measurement will be analyzed to see if using VRI in clinical practice would indeed allow prediction of satisfactory results (similar to literature benchmarks).
