Study of Hypoxia Measured in F-Miso PET/Scan and MRI in Patients With Squamous Cells Carcinoma
Hypoxia imaging has not been studied extensively by combining PET and MRI data. Few studies performed the double imaging and none associated anatomopathology with it . This study will use a rigorous methodology through the production of PET/MRI images at the same time by transferring the patient directly from PET to MRI. In addition, the population, unlike other studies, will include preoperative patients with 24-hour surgery for hypoxia imaging by obtaining additional data through specific immunohistochemical analysis of hypoxia.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx
DRUG: F-Miso PET scan coupled with MRI
Comparison of biodistribution of F-Miso PET scan in pre-therapeutic and sequences of MRI in patient with squamous cells carcinoma of oropharynx, 1 year
Correlation of F-Miso PET scan and Magnetic resonance imaging to measure hypoxia, 1 year|Correlation between recurrence free survival at one year and rate of hypoxia determined by the 3 techniques (PET scan, MRI and IHC), 1 year
