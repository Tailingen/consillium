A Study of Extended Carfilzomib Therapy for Patients Previously Enrolled in Carfilzomib Treatment Protocols
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study of carfilzomib to monitor the safety and efficacy of long-term or continuing carfilzomib therapy for patients who previously completed a primary carfilzomib treatment study.
Multiple Myeloma|Solid Tumors
DRUG: Carfilzomib
Number of Participants With Peripheral Neuropathy, Participants with peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy-related adverse events, including hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, and neuropathic pain., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks for participants with solid tumors and 44 weeks for participants with multiple myeloma.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events (AEs) were assigned a severity grade using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) grading scale version 3.0.

Per protocol, adverse events were collected if they led to dose modification or dose discontinuation, were grade â‰¥ 3 or serious, or were events of peripheral neuropathy (any grade).

A serious AE is one that met one or more of the following criteria:

* Death
* Life threatening
* Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
* Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
* A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject
* Important medical events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks for participants with solid tumors and 44 weeks for participants with multiple myeloma.
Overall Survival, Since participants were only followed up to 30 days after administration of last dose of study drug per protocol, Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival were not calculated. The number of participants who died within 30 days after administration of last dose of study drug is reported., From first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks for participants with solid tumors and 44 weeks for participants with multiple myeloma.|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the start of treatment and first evidence of documented disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first.

Disease progression was determined by the local investigator for regimens with the same baseline using the International Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC) for participants with multiple myeloma and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for solid tumor participants.

PFS was re-calculated whenever the baseline was reset due to addition of new anti-cancer therapy or increase of carfilzomib dose/frequency., From first dose of study drug in study PX-171-010 to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks for participants with solid tumors and 44 weeks for participants with multiple myeloma.|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time between start of treatment to the first documentation of disease progression. TTP was re-calculated whenever the baseline was reset due to addition of new anti-cancer therapy or increase of carfilzomib dose/frequency., From first dose of study drug in study PX-171-010 to 30 days after the last dose; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks for participants with solid tumors and 44 weeks for participants with multiple myeloma.
