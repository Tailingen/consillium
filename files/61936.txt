Non-significant Risk (NSR) Study of [68Ga]-PSMA-11 (Illuccix) as a BgRT BioGuide on RefleXion X1
To qualitatively determine the imaging performance of PET-CT imaging subsystem of the RefleXion X1 System Device in patients undergoing standard-of-care (SOC) \[68Ga\]-PSMA-11 PET-CT using Illuccix on the same day.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET-CT imaging subsystem of the RefleXion X1 System Device
Qualitative assessment of RefleXion X1 imaging performance with Illuccix PSMA PET imaging agent immediately following a standard of care Illuccix PET/CT, Qualitative imaging performance of the PET subsystem on the X1 system for detect PSMA-11 68Ga (Illuccix)-avid lesions (primary and metastatic) in patients with prostate cancer, relative to diagnostic \[68Ga\]-PSMA-11 PET-CT.

This will be assessed by the enrolling investigator with the following question:

Is there an Illuccix (PSMA-11 Ga68) avid target that correlates to the tumor location on the registered CT image? (Yes/No), From time of Reflexion scan to 48 hours after scan for adverse event evaluation
In this non-significant risk (NSR) study, investigators will perform imaging only (no treatment) on the X1 platform immediately following an already planned PET/CT diagnostic imaging using Illuccix for standard of care indications in men with prostate cancer of various stages. This approach will be used to assess imaging performance of the X1 in comparison to diagnostic imaging scanners. Evidence from this study will supplement and enhance technical understanding of the PSMA-11-guided BgRT delivery in the setting of prostate cancer. As such, the patient population selected for this investigation is meant to optimally represent the spectrum of cases, with respect to motion and radiographic environment that a radiation oncologist may encounter in practice.
