Efficacy Evaluation of Sequential Treatment With AG and Modified Folfirinox in Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. Current guidelines recommend Nab-paclitaxel, Gemcitabine and modified Folfirinox as the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen. Studies have shown that sequential chemotherapeutic regimen can effectively delay the drug resistance and improve the effect of chemotherapy. Here investigators intend to assess the effect of sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified Folfirinox on metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Progression-free survival, The time of initial response until documented tumor progression., Up to approximately 60 months
Overall survival, The time of initial response until documented patient death., Up to approximately 60 months|Objective response rate, Percentage of people does not get worse for a period of time after diagnosis, Up to approximately 60 months|Disease control rate, Percentage of patients whose cancer doesn't progress after treatment, Up to approximately 60 months|Carbohydrate antigen 19-9, Serum Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level, Up to approximately 60 months|EORTC QLQ - PAN26, Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-pancreatic cancer 26 score(EORTC QLQ - PAN26), Up to approximately 60 months|Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects, According to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects version 4, Up to approximately 60 months
Investigators chose metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who can't meet surgical criteria. The planned treatment was given to the participants after enrollment. Objective remission rate, disease control rate, tumor size, progression-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the sequential treatment with Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine and modified Folfirinox could or couldn't effectively control the progress of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
