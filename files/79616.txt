Endocan, VEGF and TNF-alpha Levels in Periodontal Disease and After Treatment
The primer aim of the study was to determine serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) endocan levels in periodontal diseases pathogenesis supported with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels.
Periodontal Disease
PROCEDURE: Non-surgical periodontal treatment
Endocan levels, Change after periodontal treatment, 6 weeks
VEGF levels, Change after periodontal treatment, 6 weeks|TNF-alpha levels, Change after periodontal treatment, 6 weeks
The study consist of three groups: periodontally healthy individuals (group 1; n = 20), individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis (group 2; n = 20), the same patients with chronic periodontitis after they had been treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) were considered as Group 3. Clinical measurements were recorded; GCF and serum samples were obtained from each participant before and 6 weeks after therapy. Endocan, VEGF-A and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
