Novel Skin Care Product for the Management of Acute Radiodermatitis
Notwithstanding the continuous progress in cancer treatment, patients with cancer still have to cope with quality of life (QoL) - impairing complications. Especially an extensive spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with cancer treatments. The number and type of cutaneous toxicities have evolved over the past 50 years, paralleling the development of new radiotherapy (RT) techniques. Acute radiodermatitis (ARD) is a distressing and painful skin reaction that occurs in 95% of the patients undergoing RT.

Important organizations in the field of oncology and supportive care, such as the MASCC, the ASCO, and the ESMO, have developed guidelines for the management of cancer therapy- related cutaneous toxicities based on available scientific evidence. Still, for some interventions, the evidence of recommendation is moderate to insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate other new potential management strategies for dermatological complications of cancer treatment. Based on the previously mentioned supportive care guidelines for the RTskin project, a novel emollient to tackle ARD has been developed.

The RTskin project general aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel skincare product to manage ARD in breast cancer patients.
