The Therapeutic Effect of Immunotherapy in Patients With Advanced Lung Squamous Carcinoma
The aim of this observational study is to investigate the treatment trajectory of immunotherapy in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sq-NSCLC). The primary objective is to identify potential indicators that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy and explore strategies to prolong its effectiveness in sq-NSCLC patients. Biological specimens and medical imaging data will be collected from patients already receiving immunotherapy as a first-line treatment, and follow-up will be conducted to analyze prognosis based on different patterns.
Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Efficacy observation
progression-free survival, The time of disease progression is evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1., A two-year period after starting treatment (Regular follow-up every three months after receiving immunotherapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment)
Overall survival, The survival time aftering receiving immunotherapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment., A three-year period after starting treatment (Regular follow-up every six months after receiving immunotherapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment)
The medical imaging data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively and the blood samples and tumor tissues will be collected prospectively.
