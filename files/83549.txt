Pre-operative Studies for Prediction of Lymph Nodes Involvement in Endometrial Cancer Patients
The study evaluates pre-operative prediction of the risk for lymph nodes involvement in endometrial cancer patients. Patients will undergo ultrasound exam (bi and three dimensional) and biomarker test - Ca 125, in addition to routine physical and laboratory exams, before surgery.

The sonographic evaluation will include endometrial characteristics and myometrial invasion, pelvic findings and enlarged lymph nodes.
