Determine MTD and to Evaluate pk, Safety/Tolerability and Efficacy Profiles of Hocena® in NSCLC Subjects
A phase I study to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and to evaluate pharmacokinetic, safety/tolerability and efficacy profiles of antroquinonol (Hocena®) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects refractory to conventional treatment modalities
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Antroquinonol
To Determind the Maximum Tolerable Dose for Antroquinonol, The study design consisted of 2 phases, the accelerated titration phase and the standard titration phase.

During the accelerated titration phase, patients were enrolled in a cohort of 1 new patient for each dose level and treated for 4 weeks at that level. Any DLT or instance of MT during any 4 week treatment at any dose level led to the initiation of standard titration (3+3) phase.

If none of the first 3 patients experienced any DLT, then dose escalation proceeded for the next cohort of patients. If 1 of 3 patients developed DLT, the cohort was expanded to at most 6 patients (another 3 patients added subsequently). If exactly 1 of the 6 patients experienced DLT, then escalation to the next dose level occurred. If more than 1 patient developed DLT in any dose cohort, the dose escalation was withheld and the prior dose level was considered as the MTD unless the present dose level was level 1, DLT is to be observed during 4 week period
Tmax After Dose, Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from all the patients in each dose cohort treated in all phases of the study. Patients will only be sampled during their first treatment cycle only. Individual serum concentration versus (vs) time curves were plotted in 1 graph by dose level on both linear/linear and log10/linear scales. Mean serum concentration vs time curves were also presented in 1 graph for dose levels on both linear/linear and log10/linear scales., 30 minutes prior to and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 24 hours after dose of Day 1&28|Half-life Time From Overall Study, Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from all the patients in each dose cohort treated in all phases of the study.

Meaning of Target lesion: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), Sum down 30% or more from target lesion baseline; Progressive Disease(PD), Sum up at least 20% from smallest value (nadir) and Absolute increase ≥ 5 mm; Stable Disease (SD), Neither enough shrinkage for PR nor enough growth for PD.

non-target lesion: CR: All non-target lesions disappeared and All lymph nodes \<10 mm; Non-CR/Non-PD: Non-target lesion(s) still present and Lymph nodes ≥10 mm; PD: Unequivocal progression; New lesion :Unequivocal new cancer lesions Overall SD response should be better than SD at target lesion, better than Non-CR/Non-PD t non-target lesion and no new lesion., pre-screening and end of treatment|Safety Blood and Urine Test, 1.

1. Antroquinonol, a novel cyclohexenone compound, is a purified compound from extract of Antrodia camphorata.
2. The pharmacological effects of antroquinonol were postulated to exert its antitumorigenesis effects through interactions to primary targets of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
3. In vivo study in NOD/SCID mice with A549 subcutaneous xenografts consistently showed tumor growth suppression after 2 weeks of oral 30 and 60 mg/kg antroquinonol treatment.
