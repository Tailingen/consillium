Observational Study on Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and the Role of K-Ras
The purpose of this study is to describe the treatments received and outcomes of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, what percentage of these patients have K-Ras mutation of the tumor, and to describe the costs of treatments. Information will also be collected regarding risk factors, variables among treatment centers and patients, and explorative analyses will be done to try to identify factors that impact prognosis and factors that predict tolerability and response to treatment.
