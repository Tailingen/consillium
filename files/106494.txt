Curcumin for the Chemoprevention of Colorectal Cancer
Specific Aims:

* To determine if curcuminoids modulate cellular proliferation as measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps.

Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease cellular proliferation in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

* To determine if curcuminoids modulate apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL assay, in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps.

Hypothesis: Curcuminoids increase apoptosis in colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

* To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 expression as measured by immunohistochemical assays in subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps

Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease colorectal mucosa COX-2 expression in subjects with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

* To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 activity as measured by urinary eicosanoids

Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease concentrations of urinary eicosanoids.
