A Phase 1 Pilot Study of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT Imaging to Histology in Men With Prostate Cancer
This is a single arm, open label study of up to 24 prostate cancer patients scheduled for prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients receive a single IV dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours after injection. As standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) within two weeks of study drug dosing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 99mTc MIP 1404
Tissue distribution of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT imaging in tumor and non-tumorous regions of the prostate, Tissue distribution of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT imaging in tumor and non-tumorous regions of the prostate (as determined by histopathology) in patients undergoing standard of care prostatectomy, Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken
Safety of 99mTc-MIP-1404 will be assessed by measuring Vital Signs (blood pressure and heart rate)Pre-Dose and Post-Dose as well as between 3-6 hours post-dose, Summary tables will present change from pre-dose to post-dose vital signs measurements., Vital signs measurements will be taken, an expected average of 30 minutes before and after study drug injection and between 3-6 hours after study drug injection|Tissue distribution of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT imaging in tumor and non-tumorous regions of pelvic lymph node, To obtain exploratory tissue distribution of 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT imaging in tumor and non-tumorous regions of pelvic lymph node, Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken|Intensity of 99mTc-MIP-1404 uptake with respect to PSMA expression, Evaluate the intensity of 99mTc-MIP-1404 uptake with respect to PSMA expression, PSMA expression analysis will be conducted upon completion of enrollment
