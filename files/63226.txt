Stereotactic Radiosurgery or Other Local Ablation Then Erlotinib in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
- Progression free survival after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR patients progressed after EGFR-TKI therapy
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Radiosurgery|DRUG: Erlotinib
Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy reported as percentage of participants who are alive and without progressive disease at 3 months. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions., 3 months after Initiation of Stereostatic Radiotherapy
Percentage of Participants With Local Control of Sites on Erlotinib Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Count of subjects who had local control of sites previously progressive on erlotinib following SRS followed by erlotinib. Using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), local control is defined as Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; or Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; in sites ablated by SRS., Initiation of Stereotactic Radiotherapy every 6 to 12 weeks until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Median Overall Survival, To estimate overall survival (OS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant, NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy measured as length of time from start of treatment until date of death from any cause, up to 5 years after end of treatment|Toxicity Rate From Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Toxicity of SRS will be measured by NCI CTCAE version 4 following completion of SRS, but prior to erlotinib re-initiation. The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE., From initiation to the end of SRS, up to 15 days|Toxicity Rate Attributed to Erlotinib, Toxicity of erlotinib will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 4) which is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE., from end of SRS to end of erlotinib treatment (median duration of 5.7 months)
Primary Objectives

- To estimate progression free survival (PFS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate local control of sites previously progressive on erlotinib following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) followed by erlotinib
* To estimate overall survival (OS) after locally ablative therapy and erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI therapy
* To characterize the toxicity of SRS
* To characterize the toxicity of erlotinib when preceded by SRS

Exploratory Objectives

* To explore if VeriStrat results at initial progression are associated with longer PFS or OS after study treatment
* To explore if VeriStrat results following completion of SRS are associated with longer PFS or OS after re-initiation of erlotinib
* To explore whether "poor" VeriStrat signatures ever turn to "good" signatures with the study therapy, and to explore PFS and OS of patients whose signature changes
