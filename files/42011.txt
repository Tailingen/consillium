Study to Evaluate the Usability of PointCheck
This a study about the usability of PointCheck a novel non-invasive technology for monitoring chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The study will include patients with cancer visiting the outpatient hematology clinic for their standard of care chemotherapy administration. A final sample size of 60 oncologic outpatients will be enrolled and studied with the technology.

The main objective is to evaluate the usability of PointCheck. Secondary outcomes include a preliminary assessment of PointCheck diagnostic accuracy and precision.

For this, study subjects will be tested twice with PointCheck during the same session and the usability in an at-home simulated environment by naïve users will be evaluated.

PointCheck's Usability, To gather data with the ultimate goal of determining the usability of the proposed non-invasive method measured by the the number and % of user errors (globally and per error type) observed in the clinic visits. In addition, the number and % of users successfully completing the test without errors will be measured., Up to three-weeks|System Usability Scale (0-100 higher scores indicate better usability), To confirm the usability of the system using the System Usability Scale, Up to three-weeks
PointCheck's Precision, To perform an exploratory analysis of the percentage agreement of PointCheck's estimation of WBC from two independent one-minute videos., Up to three-weeks|PointCheck's Accuracy, To perform a exploratory analysis of PointCheck's accuracy (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, AUROC) to detect severe neutropenia compared with the gold standard blood analysis method employed by the 12 de Octubre Hospital core laboratory in the range between ≤500 and \>500 ANC/µL., Up to three-weeks|PointCheck's Utility, To evaluate the % of patients that had to be rescheduled because the sole presence of neutropenia and how many of them were correctly detected with PointCheck., Up to three-weeks|PointCheck's Safety: total number (%) of AEs and SAEs, The number (and %) of AEs, SAEs and their relationship with the device use will be the safety endpoint, Up to three-weeks
Exploratory diagnostic performance for a second cutoff, The preliminary diagnostic accuracy to detect grade III neutropenia according to CTCAE V5 (\<1000 ANC/mm3) 13 measured by the sensitivity and the specificity will be the evaluated with reference to the corresponding laboratory measures acquired., Up to three-weeks
