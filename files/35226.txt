A Study to Assess Adverse Events and How Intravenously (IV) Infused Telisotuzumab Vedotin (ABBV-399) Moves Through the Body as a Monotherapy in Adult Participants With Previously Treated Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. The purpose of this study is to assess how safe telisotuzumab vedotin is in adult participants with NSCLC. Change in disease activity and adverse events will be assessed.

Telisotuzumab vedotin is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NSCLC. Participants will be randomly assigned a treatment of telisotuzumab vedotin in 1 of 3 arms at an 1:1:1 ratio. Each group receives intravenous (IV) infusion of telisotuzumab vedotin at different doses. Approximately 150 adult participants with c-Met overexpressing NSCLC will be enrolled in the study at approximately 70 to 80 sites worldwide.

Participants will receive IV telisotuzumab vedotin at 1 of 3 dose regimens as part of a 3 year study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
