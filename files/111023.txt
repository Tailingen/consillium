Patients whom have selected the CE-marked Sonata system for treatment of fibroids will be approached for study participation. Participation in the trial will consist of data collection in the form of questionnaires prior to and after the treatment at the following intervals: pre-procedure, 4 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years following treatment.

The following data points will be collected: Length of stay, time to return to normal activities (Treatment Recovery Questionnaire), time to return to sexual activity (Treatment Recovery Questionnaire), change in fibroid symptom severity and quality of life (UFS-QOL), change in general health outcome (EQ-5D), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), subject satisfaction and overall treatment effect (Overall Treatment Effect and Satisfaction Questionnaire), pregnancy occurrence and outcome, non-medical re-intervention, adverse events related to the device/procedure.

Validated questionnaires are used where appropriate (UFS-QOL, E1-5D and WPAI). Double data entry will occur to ensure accurate capture of subject reported data. Monitoring will occur throughout the course of the trial to ensure adherence to the protocol.

As an observational trial, there are no pre-specified statistically powered endpoints.
