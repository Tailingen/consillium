A Study of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase 1 clinical trial is intended to understand the safety and tolerability of a new anticancer drug in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The patients who qualify for the study will receive a once daily dose of the drug taken by mouth and will undergo several tests to measure the drug in the blood and to understand the safety, tolerability and any effect of the drug on the tumor. The antitumor effect of the drug is not known in human.
Solid Tumors|Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: DS-2248
Summary of Objective Response Rate Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Objective response rate was defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Baseline up to disease progression, discontinuation of study, or death, up to 2 years 11 months
Summary of Best Overall Response Rate Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Complete response (CR) was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the sum of CR and PR rates., Baseline up to disease progression, discontinuation of study, or death, up to 2 years 11 months|Summary of Disease Control Rate Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates, and stable disease (SD) rate for a minimum of 12 weeks. Complete response (CR) was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Baseline up to disease progression, discontinuation of study, or death, up to 2 years 11 months|Duration of Stable Disease Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Duration of response measured from the time at which criteria were first met for complete (CR) or partial response (PR) until the first date that progressive disease (PD) was objectively documented. Participants who had not progressed at the data cut-off date were censored at their last evaluable tumor assessment date. Duration of stable disease (SD) measured from the date of enrollment until the first date that criteria for disease progression were met. The minimum time interval for the duration of SD was 6 weeks. Participants who had not progressed at the data cut-off date were censored at their last evaluable tumor assessment date., Baseline up to disease progression, discontinuation of study, or death, up to 2 years 11 months|Summary of Progression-free Survival Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of radiographic disease progression (as per RECIST V1.1) or death due to any cause. Participants who were alive with no objective documentation of (radiographic) disease progression by the data cut-off date were censored at the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who were lost to follow-up or withdrew early from the study with no documented disease progression were censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment., Baseline up to disease progression, discontinuation of study, or death, up to 2 years 11 months|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From Zero to Infinity Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Cycle 1, Day 1 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h postdose; Cycle 1, Day 2 and Day 15; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose, 1 and 6 h postdose; Cycle 2 and 3, Day 1, 8, and 15|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Concentration Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Cycle 1, Day 1 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h postdose; Cycle 1, Day 2 and Day 15; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose, 1 and 6 h postdose; Cycle 2 and 3, Day 1, 8, and 15|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time at Maximum Concentration Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Cycle 1, Day 1 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h postdose; Cycle 1, Day 2 and Day 15; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose, 1 and 6 h postdose; Cycle 2 and 3, Day 1, 8, and 15|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Terminal Half-life Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Cycle 1, Day 1 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h postdose; Cycle 1, Day 2 and Day 15; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose, 1 and 6 h postdose; Cycle 2 and 3, Day 1, 8, and 15|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Total Body Clearance Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, Cycle 1, Day 1 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h postdose; Cycle 1, Day 2 and Day 15; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose, 1 and 6 h postdose; Cycle 2 and 3, Day 1, 8, and 15|Summary of Drug Related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Following Oral Administration of DS-2248 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pre-treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in severity after starting treatment relative to the pre-treatment state, when the AE is continuous. A DS-2248-related TEAE is an TEAE that is related to DS-2248 in the relationship., Baseline up to 30 days post last dose, up to 2 years 11 months
The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study in which subjects in each cohort will be given increasing doses of the study drug until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The drug will be administered as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no interruption between cycles if no unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor progression are observed.

After determining the RP2D, Part 2 of the study, which is a dose expansion study will begin in which subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who developed acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib (and others) or whose tumors carry an ALK translocation and are resistant to ALK inhibitor therapy, will be treated with DS-2248 at RP2D. The drug will be administered as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no interruption between cycles if no unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor progression are observed.
