A Study of Neoadjuvant Therapy With BCD-217 (Nurulimab + Prolgolimab) in Patients With Resectable Stage III Skin Melanoma
This study is an open-label, randomized, comparative phase III study, which will include subjects with resectable stage III skin melanoma (up to 3 resectable transient metastases are acceptable).

In both study groups, adjuvant therapy is possible until melanoma progresses to unresectable stage III-IV, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of ICF or the end of the therapy period (12 months).

In case of postoperative relapse of the disease, at the decision of the investigator and if the lesion is resectable, radical surgical treatment can be carried out (R0 - resection) in accordance with current clinical guidelines without withdrawing the patient from the study.
