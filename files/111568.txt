Efficacy and Safety of VDA-1102 Ointment in the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, parallel-cohort study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VDA-1102 in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) on the head of male and female adult subjects.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: 5% VDA-1102|DRUG: 10% VDA-1102
Change From Baseline in the Number of Actinic Keratosis Lesions in the Treatment Field on Day 56, To compare the reduction on Day 56 in the number of the actinic keratosis (AK) lesions in the Treatment Field of subjects receiving once-daily topical 5% or 10% VDA-1102 ointment for 28 days to the reduction in the number of AK lesions in subjects receiving placebo., Baseline and day 56
Percentage of Patients With Complete Clearance of Actinic Keratosis Lesions in the Treatment Field, The percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance of AK lesions within the Treatment Field on Day 56., Baseline and Day 56|Change From Baseline in the Number of AK Lesions Within the Treatment Field of Each Subject on Day 84., To compare the reduction on Day 84 in the number of the actinic keratosis lesions, Baseline and day 84|AK Grade 2 Lesions Number: Change From Baseline (Day 1 Pre-dose) in Sub-group of Subjects With at Least One Grade 2 Lesion at Baseline (From ITT Population), Change from Baseline (Day 1 Pre-dose) in Sub-group of Subjects with at least one Grade 2 Lesion at Baseline (from ITT Population)in the number of grade ≥ 2 lesions.

Grade 2 defined as: moderate (moderately thick AK that are easily seen and felt), Baseline and day 56|Change From Baseline in the Adjusted Number of Lesions Weighted by Grade ([Number of Grade 1 Lesions] + [2× Number of Grade 2 Lesions] + [3× Number of Grade 3 Lesions]), Change From Baseline in the Adjusted Number of Lesions Weighted by Grade (\[Number of Grade 1 Lesions\] + \[2× Number of Grade 2 Lesions\] + \[3× Number of Grade 3 Lesions\]) Grade 1 - mild (slightly palpable AK that are felt better than seen) Grade 2 - moderate (moderately thick AK that are easily seen and felt) Grade 3 - severe (very thick and/or obvious AK)., Baseline and day 56
Approximately 84 subjects who meet the study's enrollment criteria at the completion of the Screening Period will be randomized to receive 5% or 10% VDA-1102, or matched-placebo. During the Treatment Period, study drug will be applied once-daily for 28 days to a 25 square centimeter area of skin containing 4-8 actinic keratosis lesions on the face or scalp. Subjects will be followed for an additional 28 days (Observation Period) wherein no study drug will be applied.

The purpose of the study is to determine whether once-daily application of VDA-1102 ointment for 28 days is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratosis of the face and scalp.
