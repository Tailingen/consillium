A Study of C-CAR088 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR088 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The phase Ib part of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of C-CAR088 in the targeted patient population.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell

The study includes the following sequential procedures: Screening, Apheresis and C-CAR088 manufacturing, Baseline testing, Lymphodepletion, C-CAR088 infusion, and Follow-up Visit. Two dose levels of C-CAR088 will be tested during the phase Ib part to determine RP2D, which will be further evaluated during the phase II part.
