POINTING: Clinical Cohort Study of Patients With Melanoma and NSCLC Receiving Checkpoint Inhibitors
This is a two-center, prospective continuously accruing longitudinal cohort study in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma eligible for standard anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. The data from this prospective longitudinal cohort will be used in the POINTING (towards patient -tailored cancer immunotherapy supported by a multifaceted predictive signature composed of integrative omics and molecular imaging) KWF Kankerbestrijding project (WP4). The goal of this project is to develop a multifaceted predictive signature, by using new techniques on tumor characteristics before and during treatment with immune therapy. To do so, researchers will use the 'omics' approach. By combining molecular omics comprising genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics with radiomics and molecular imaging a set of factors will arise which can accurately predict the outcome of the treatment.

Participants in this cohort will undergo tumor biopsies, venous blood sampling and feces sampling before, during and at the end of standard anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Also, data derived form routine procedures performed for standard-of-care anti-PD-1 treatment (ao laboratory assessments, CT and FDG-PET) will be collected.

Predictive signatures based on multi-omics for PD-1 antibody treatment response as assessed by RECIST1.1, The aim of this clinical cohort is to develop and validate multifaceted predictive signatures for PD-1 antibody effects with relevant components of integrative omics (histology, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics and/or molecular imaging), which predict, which patients have a â‰¤ 5% chance of responding to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment., 5 years
2. Predictive signatures based on multi-omics for PD-1 antibody treatment toxicity as assessed by CTCAE 4.03., As secondary aim, the relation between multifaceted signatures composed by relevant components of integrative omics (histology, immunohistochemistry, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics and/or molecular imaging) and toxicity of PD-1 antibody treatment will be assessed. Toxicity will be scored according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03., 5 years
