A Study of Real-world Treatment of Adults With Urothelial Cancer in South Korea and Saudi Arabia
Cancer in the bladder lining (urothelial cancer) can be treated in many ways. One way is to directly attack cancer cells. Enfortumab vedotin is a treatment that can do this. Another way is to help the body's immune system find and attack cancer cells. Avelumab is a treatment that can do this. Both treatments were recently approved in some countries.

Doctors have standard clinical practice guidelines to help them treat people with cancer. This study is about collecting information on how adults with urothelial cancer are treated in standard clinical practice. The people in this study will have locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to tissue close by.

Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

The goal of this study is to learn how people with urothelial cancer receive medical care in clinics in South Korea and Saudi Arabia. The main goals are to learn more about the people receiving treatments, and the treatments they receive.

This study is about collecting information only. The individual's doctor decides on treatment, not the study sponsor (Astellas).

Information will be collected from the people's medical records. This will include 12 months before treatment starts, and during treatment. Also, doctors will answer questions in interviews and surveys about how they care for people with urothelial cancer.
