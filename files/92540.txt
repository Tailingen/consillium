Peripheral Blood and/or Bone Marrow, Including Detection of Occult Metastases, in Patients With Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine if tumor cells can be detected in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow of patients with melanoma.
Melanoma
Assess the sensitivity of RT-PCR to detect evidence of melanoma cells in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood and estimate sensitivity separately for each of the different stage groupings for melanoma, 2 years
Patients with melanoma can succumb to subclinical metastatic disease, not detectable at presentation by conventional physical examination, hematologic and biochemical screening, or radiologic evaluation. More intensive radiologic evaluation with CT or radioisotope scanning has not proven to be useful. What may be useful is a more sensitive method of staging melanoma patients at presentation, specifically evaluating them for subclinical systemic disease.
