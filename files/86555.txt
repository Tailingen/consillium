Phase 1 to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of GCC2005 in Patients With R/R NK and T-cell Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 (a and b), first in human (FIH), single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GCC2005 in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) NK or T-cell malignancies who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.
Lymphoma, T-Cell
DRUG: GCC2005|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Safety: Frequency, severity, and persistence of AEs and AEs Grade 3 or higher, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GCC2005 in patients with relapsed/refractory NK/T cell malignancies.

Frequency, severity, and persistence of AEs and AEs Grade 3 or higher using NCI CTCAE ver5.0 including CRS, and neurotoxicity based on the ASTCT criteria and acute GvHD based on the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD MAGIC guidance and chronic GvHD based on the National Institutes of Health 2014 criteria, incidence of TEAEs.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), From the time of enrollment through End of Study (up to 18 months per patient)|To determine MTD and RP2D: Safety(based on frequency, severity, and persistence of AEs and AEs Grade 3 or higher), efficacy (based on ORR) and pharmacokinetics, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), From the time of enrollment through End of Study (up to 18 months per patient)
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of GCC2005 in treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory NK cell and T-cell malignancies expressing CD5. Phase 1a of the study will be conducted to establish a dose range that is well tolerated by the majority of patients and to provide a safety profile of GCC2005 in target patient population. Phase 1b of the study is planned to conduct dose optimization to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
