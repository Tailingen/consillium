DS-3201b in Participants With Lymphomas
DS-3201b is an experimental drug that is being investigated in clinical research.

Adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) may be able to join this study if their disease has come back after remission or is not responding to current treatment

This study has three parts. The Dose Escalation part is designed is to find the safe dose of DS-3201b that adults with advanced NHL can tolerate. The Dose Expansion phase will determine how effective DS-3201b is for rare types of NH and collect additional safety data. Last, the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Cohort (US Only) will evaluate the effect of DS-3201b on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam and digoxin when co-administered to patients with NHL

Best overall response, based on international consensus criteria, Best overall response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved each category as the best response, considering all overall responses assessed at all time points after the start of study treatment.

Categories: CR, CRu, PR, SD, RD/PD, UA
