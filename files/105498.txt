A Multicenter, Open-label, Prospective Phase III Clinical Trial to Evaluate INR101 Injection for PET/CT Imaging in Participants With Suspected Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Treatment
A multicenter, open-label, prospective Phase III clinical trial to evaluate INR101 injection for PET/CT imaging in participants with suspected recurrent prostate cancer after radical treatment.
Prostate Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: INR101
With the composite diagnostic criteria as the standard of truth, the positive predictive value (PPV) at the participant level by PET/CT imaging with INR101 injection of lesion detection, The positive predictive value (PPV) of the participant level will be determined of INR101 injection PET/CT imaging for detection of lesion, confirming against imaging, clinical follow-up, and histopathology when available, 3~12 months after administration
With pathological diagnosis as the standard of truth, Correct Detection Rate (CDR), Correct Localization Rate (CLR) at the participant level by PET/CT imaging with INR101 injection of lesion detection, The Correct Detection Rate (CDR), Correct Localization Rate (CLR) of the participant level will be determined of INR101 injection PET/CT imaging for detection of lesion, confirming against imaging, clinical follow-up, and histopathology when available, 3~12 months after administration|With pathological diagnosis as the standard of truth, the positive predictive value (PPV) at the regional level (prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, extra-pelvic lymph nodes, visceral/soft tissues, bone) by PET/CT imaging with INR101 injection of lesion detect, The positive predictive value (PPV) of the regional level (prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, extra-pelvic lymph nodes, visceral/soft tissues, bone) will be determined of INR101 injection PET/CT imaging for detection of lesion, confirming against imaging, clinical follow-up, and histopathology when available, 3~12 months after administration|In the group with negative baseline conventional imaging, the detection rate (DR), correct detection rate (CDR), and positive predictive value (PPV) at the participant level by PET/CT imaging with INR101 injection of lesion detection, The detection rate (DR), correct detection rate (CDR), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the participant level will be determined of INR101 injection PET/CT imaging for detection of lesion, confirming against imaging, clinical follow-up, and histopathology when available, 3~12 months after administration|Among participants with different baseline PSA levels, the positive predictive value (PPV) at the participant level of PET/CT imaging with INR101 injection, The positive predictive value (PPV) will be evaluated on a per- participant basis, stratified by PSA values: 0.2\~0.5, 0.5\~1.0, 1.0 \~2.0, 2.0\~5.0, ≥5.0ng/mL, 3~12 months after administration|Assess the consistency of the diagnosis of PET/CT images intra- and inter-reader, The intra- and inter-reader performance will be evaluated by adjudication rate and accept rate, 3~12 months after administration|Evaluate the safety and tolerability, including adverse events (AE)/serious adverse events (SAE), vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiograms, Adverse events will be determined through clinical assessment and categorized by CTCAE 5.0, 7 days after administration
This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized Phase III clinical trial evaluating the diagnostic efficacy and safety of INR101 injection PET/CT imaging in participants with suspected recurrence prostate cancer, who have experienced an increase in PSA levels after previously receiving radical treatment.

Participants enrolled in clinical trial will receive a single intravenous injection of INR101 injection at a dose of 7 mCi ± 15%, and PET/CT imaging will be performed 80 to 120 minutes after the injection.

The PET/CT images of INR101 injection for each participant will be interpreted independently by two readers blinded to all participant information. When the conclusions of the two readers are inconsistent, a third reader will be added for an adjudication interpretation (the third reader will also be in a blinded during the interpretation process and shall not be aware of the conclusions of the first two readers).

This study adopts a composite diagnostic criterion as the standard of truth. The interpretation of the composite diagnostic criterion is as follows: If a pathological diagnosis can be obtained, the pathological diagnosis shall be regarded as the standard of truth; if a pathological diagnosis cannot be obtained, a comprehensive interpretation shall be made based on the participant's medical history, changes in PSA levels and the results of conventional imaging examinations. The interpretation of the composite diagnostic criterion for each participant will be interpreted independently by two readers. When the conclusions of the two readers are inconsistent, a third reader will be added for an adjudication interpretation.
