Prospective Multi-omics Observational Study of Gynecological Rare Pathological Tumors
The goal of this observational study is to draw the characteristic maps of genomics, transcriptome, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. in 600 patients with gynecological rare pathological types of malignant tumors. Then it is planned to explore the molecular mechanism and find some new targets for diagnosis and treatment, and design and establish the database system of the above rare tumors.
Rare Gynecological Tumors|Multi-omics Analysis
Multi-omics feature map, Draw the characteristic maps of imaging omics, genomics, transcriptome, proteomics, pathological omics, metabolomics, etc. of patients with gynecological rare pathological types of malignant tumors, and explore the molecular mechanism thus finding some new targets for diagnosis and treatment., August 2023 to May 2028|Database system, Design and establish the database system of the above gynecological rare pathological types of tumors., August 2023 to May 2028
