A Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CART) in the Treatment of Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, investigator-initiated exploratory study.The study is designed to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of HER2-E-CART cells for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, refractory advanced solid tumors in three dose groups: low, medium and high.

This study was a one-arm,investigator-initiated exploratory study. According to the "3+3" principle, three dose groups with increasing dose were set up, namely low, medium and high dose groups, with separate cell counts. A total of 9-12 subjects were enrolled in the group and given intravenous infusion. Dose-limited toxicity was observed from the beginning of preconditioning to 28 days after CAR T infusion.
