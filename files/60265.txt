Study Comparing Blinatumomab Alternating With Low-intensity Chemotherapy Versus Standard of Care Chemotherapy for Older Adults With Newly Diagnosed Philadelphia-negative B-cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The safety run-in part of the study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of blinatumomab alternating with low-intensity chemotherapy. The phase 3 part of the study aims to compare event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of participants receiving blinatumomab alternating with low-intensity chemotherapy to EFS and (OS) of participants receiving standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy.
