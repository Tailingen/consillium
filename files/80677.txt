DRUG: GNC-038
Phase Ib: Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT), The incidence and severity of adverse events (TEAE) during treatment were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v5.0)., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), In the dose increment stage, the highest dose whose estimated DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate but does not exceed the upper bound of the equivalent interval of DLT rate is selected as MTD., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of GNC-038. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of GNC-038., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of GNC-038., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase II: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ib: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of GNC-038 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib:Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), AESI is an event of scientific and medical interest specific to the sponsor's product or research project., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of GNC-038 will be investigated., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib:Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of GNC-038 will be investigated., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib:AUC0-inf, Blood concentration - Area under time line., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: AUC0-T, Blood concentration - Area under time line., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: CL(Clearance), To study the serum clearance rate of GNC-038 per unit time., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of GNC-038 will be investigated., Up to 16 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency and titer of anti-GNC-038 antibody (ADA) will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of GNC-038 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II:Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of GNC-038. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of GNC-038., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ib: To explore the safety and preliminary effectiveness of GNC-038 under the administration mode of "intravenous infusion for 2h to 4h, once a week (IV, QW), 2 weeks as one cycle", and to determine MTD, MAD, DLT and RP2D of GNC-038. The pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of GNC-038 will be evaluated. Phase II: To explore the efficacy, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of GNC-038.
