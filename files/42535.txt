SpaceOAR System RWS in China
This study aims to evaluate the safety and performance of SpaceOAR System when it is used to create space between the rectum and prostate in men undergoing radiotherapy for localized T1-T2 prostate cancer in China via collecting the real word data of SpaceOAR System used, to generate local clinical evidence on Chinese patients.
Localized T1-T2 Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: SpaceOAR Treatment
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint, The distance between the posterior prostatic capsule and anterior rectal wall,, Within 10 days post spaceOAR hydrogel administration.|Primary Safety Endpoint, Subjects with AEs related to SpaceOAR system and/or procedure within 30 days following procedure will be observed., Within 30 days following procedure
Functional Success, Distance Posterior Prostatic Capsule and Anterior Rectal Wall, Within 10 days post spaceOAR hydrogel administration.
This study is a retrospective and prospective, single arm, real world study. For those patients who have already received the SpaceOAR treatment before study kick-off, the data at baseline and the day of procedure will be retrospectively collected. For those patients who will receive SpaceOAR treatment after study kick-off, the clinical data at baseline, the day of procedure and 30 days post procedure will be prospectively collected.

Up to 20 subjects with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of clinical stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer indicated for radiotherapy will be enrolled, for there are chances of missing data in the real world study. A sample of 14 subjects provides at least 90% power for the primary objective.
