Study of Acetazolamide With Temozolomide in Adults With Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Malignant Glioma
This is a Phase I study that examines the rate of dose limiting side effects in patients with malignant astrocytoma treated with combination acetazolamide (ACZ) and temozolomide (TMZ). Eligible patients must have histologically proven newly diagnosed, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylated WHO grade III or IV astrocytoma and be planning to undergo treatment with standard adjuvant TMZ (after completing treatment with TMZ and ionizing radiation (IR)).

During this study, patients will receive daily oral ACZ with TMZ. During each cycle, ACZ will be started on the day of TMZ initiation and continued for a total of 21 days.
Malignant Glioma of Brain
DRUG: Acetazolamide|DRUG: Temozolomide
Number of participants with adverse events, To determine the safety, tolerability and adverse event profile of adding acetazolamide to temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytoma., 28 Days
Measure objective response rate (ORR); change in tumor size, ORR will be determined at 6 months and is based on the change in tumor size (as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) criteria) at the indicated time relative to the pre-treatment scan. RANO criteria will also be used to define disease status (CR, PR, etc.)., 6 months|Time until progression free survival (PFS), 6 months|Time until overall survival (OS), From start date of therapy to the date of death from any cause, whichever may come first, assessed up to 100 months|Analysis of formalin fixed paraffin embedded surgical specimens., Bcl-3 expression will be determined by an independent neuro-pathologist by immunohistochemical analysis of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) surgical specimens. This is to evaluate Bcl-3 expression level within each tumor and preliminarily examine the ability of Bcl-3 to predict response to TMZ and the efficacy of adding ACZ., Through study completion an average of one year|To determine feasibility of cooperative interaction between multiple sites, Feasibility to be determined based on ability to complete accrual to the study, End of study enrollment period (approximately 6 years)
