Study of ESG401 in Adults With Solid Tumors
The primary objective in Phase I is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ESG401 as a single agent administered in 21-day treatment cycles in previously treated participants with advanced epithelial cancer. In Phase II, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ESG401 administered in 21-day treatment cycles at a dose selected in Phase I.

Tumor types in the study will include: cervical, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, esophageal, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck cancers- squamous cell, hepatocellular, prostate, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic, renal cell, small-cell lung cancer, non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).

DRUG: ESG401
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse events (AEs) that begin or worsen on or after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The severity was graded based on the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. An AE that met one or more of the following outcomes was classified as serious:

Fatal Life-threatening Disabling/incapacitating Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay A congenital abnormality Other important medical events may also be considered serious AEs if they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, First dose date up to last dose plus 30 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Central Review (ICR), ORR is defined as the rate an overall best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by ICR assessment according to RECIST1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in short axis of any pathologic lymphnode to \<10 mm. PR was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters. Per planned analysis, ORR by ICR will be assessed for the TNBC Target Population in phase 2 only., Up to 49 months
Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration, Up to 49 months|AUC0-inf, Area under the serum concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity, Up to 49 months|Objective Response Rate by Local Assessment, ORR is defined as the rate an overall best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by local assessment. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in short axis of any pathologic lymphnode to \<10 mm. PR was defined as ≥3 0% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters. Per planned analysis, ORR by local assessment will be assessed for the Target Population both in phase 1 and phase 2., Up to 49 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Local Assessment, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from the first dose start date to the date of disease progression defined as documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 49 months|Overall Survival by Local Assessment, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dose start date to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 49 months|ADA, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies, Up to 49 months
