This study, we will build upon our prior work and test the feasibility of a Mediterranean diet intervention for medically underserved men with prostate cancer seen at LBJ Hospital, a large safety net facility in Harris County, TX.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Mediterranean diet-based Intervention
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

To determine the feasibility of a Mediterranean diet-based intervention adapted for underrepresented minority men with prostate cancer, defined based on the following process measures68:

* Enrollment (completion of 25 patient accrual within 2 years)
* Retention (completion of the study through the 6-month time point, with ≥80% defined as successful)
* Adherence (the percentage of completed study sessions and clinic visits, with ≥70% considered successful).

Secondary Objectives:

To determine changes due to the Mediterranean diet intervention in the following measures:

* Mediterranean diet score (define using MEPA I calculated using FFQ data)
* Weight/BMI
* QoL (EQ-5D-5L)
* Physical activity (IPAS)
* Non-invasive biomarkers
* Gut microbiome
* Metabolomics
