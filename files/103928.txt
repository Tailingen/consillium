A Study to Determine the Efficacy of a Digital Self-management Support Tool to Improve the Quality of Life During Adjuvant HOrmonal Therapy for Patients With Early Breast Cancer
Randomized trial that compares a personalized digitally-enabled pathway delivered by a mobile application in addition to standard of care vs. standard of care alone in patients with HR+ early breast cancer reporting endocrine therapy related adverse events.

The HOPE study is a national, prospective, randomized, open-label trial conducted in France. 180 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either 12 weeks of multimodal Resilience© digital companion including education and self-care modules in addition to the standard of care provided by their treating oncologists and supportive care team at their care centers or 12 weeks of standard of care provided by their treating oncologists and supportive care team at their care centers.

Data from the literature in oncology trials with Patient-Reported Outcomes suggests that in the absence of double-blind concealment, clinically important differences could still be detected.
Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer Early Stage Breast Cancer (Stage 1-3)
OTHER: multimodal Resilience© digital companion|OTHER: Standard supportive care
To determine the efficacy of a personalized approach, consisting of a multi-component, interventional mobile application in addition to standard of care, compared with standard care alone in improving quality of life (QOL) after 12 weeks., The primary endpoint of the study is the ET symptoms scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaire (QLQ)-BR45 over a 12-weeks period., up to 12 weeks of intervention
To evaluate the impact of the intervention on other EORTC QLQ-C30 domains, including fatigue, emotional distress, pain, and sleep quality;, after 12 months of randomization|To evaluate the impact of the intervention on insomnia measured by a wearable device;, Insomnia by a wearable device capturing sleep quality and sleep cycle (Withings© Pulse HR smartwatch);, up to 12 months after randomization|To evaluate the impact of the intervention on adherence to endocrine therapy, assessed through the modified MIS-A questionnaire, reliable, easy-to-use, self-administered questionnaire, validated in France that is able to longitudinally capture granular data on non-adherence to chronic medication over short and long time., up to 12 months after randomization|To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the perceived self-efficacy of symptom management;, Perceived self-efficacy in symptom management will be evaluated using the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions - Managing Symptoms - Short Form 8a questionnaire., up to 12 months after randomization|To evaluate the impact of the intervention on eHealth Literacy levels, Ability of the patients to find, understand and use information to improve their health from electronic sources using the eHLQ questionnaire, up to 12 months after randomization|To evaluate the implementation process including the adoption of the HOPE digitally enabled supportive care pathway (Resilience mobile application), Information on digital health adoption and implementation process will be measured by different criteria:

- Willingness rate (Resilience© digital companion): will be defined as the rate of patients that activated a Resilience account adoption rate (Resilience© digital companion): will be defined as the rate of users who used Resilience as intended Full digital usage experience: using the experience questionnaire developped for the study, up to 12 weeks of intervention|To evaluate the patient experience in using a web platform (WeShare) for collecting ePROs data., Using the experience questionnaire developped for the study and the French System Usability Scale, up to 12 weeks of intervention|To evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity levels measured by a wearable device;, Physical activity levels will be captured through a wearable device (number of steps, distance in Km and calories burned) (Withings © Pulse HR smartwatch), up to 12 weeks of intervention
