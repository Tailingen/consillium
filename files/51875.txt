Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Neoplasms|Digestive System Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE)|BIOLOGICAL: DC-CIK
Overall survival, 3 years
Progress-free survival, 3 years|Quality of life (QOL), 3 years|Phenotypic analysis of T cells, 1 years
60 patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma, who had received Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) , will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK+ TACE treatment) or group B (just receive TACE), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.
