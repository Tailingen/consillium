The Effect of Clamping the Indwelling Urethral Catheter Before Removal From Patients After Type III Radical Hysterectomy
The effect of clamping the indwelling urethral catheter before removal is an unsettled issue in clinical practice. No studies have done before in the patients with gynecologic cancers who received radical hysterectomy. We hypothesized that clamping the catheter would decrease the rate of recatheterization. In addition, the feeling of urination during clamping is correlated with lower rate of recatheterization after removal.
Gynecologic Cancer
PROCEDURE: to clamp or release the catheter for 2 days before removal
rate of recatheterization, 12 months
