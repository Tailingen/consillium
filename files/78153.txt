A Study of FDA018-ADC in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of FDA018-ADC in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced/ Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: FDA018-ADC
The dose limiting toxicity ( DLT), Evaluated according to NCI CTCAE V5.0, From first dose to the end of Cycle 1, up to 35 days.|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 or more in a cohort of either 3 or 6 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) attributed to FDA018., From first dose to the end of Cycle 1, up to 35 days.
Time to peak (Tmax), Tmax of Total Antibody, Total SN-38, Free SN-38, SN-38 Glucuronide and FDA018-ADC will be measured., Up to 17 weeks.|Half-life time (t1/2), t1/2 of Total Antibody, Total SN-38, Free SN-38, SN-38 Glucuronide and FDA018-ADC will be measured., Up to 17 weeks.|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of Total Antibody, Total SN-38, Free SN-38, SN-38 Glucuronide and FDA018-ADC will be measured., Up to 17 weeks.|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC of Total Antibody, Total SN-38, Free SN-38, SN-38 Glucuronide and FDA018-ADC will be measured., Up to 17 weeks.|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The subject's ADA positive rate will be assessed By ELISA., From subject randomization up to 60 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, ORR was defined as the rate an overall best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in short axis of any pathologic lymphnode to \<10 mm. PR was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking the baseline sum diameters., From subject randomization up to 60 months.|Progression free survival(PFS) according to RECIST 1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from the first dose start date to the date of disease progression defined as documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From subject randomization up to 60 months.|Duration of Response(DOR) according to RECIST 1.1, Duration of Response was defined as the duration of overall response measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., From subject randomization up to 60 months.|Overall Survival (OS) according to RECIST 1.1, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the first dose start date to the date of death due to any cause., From subject randomization up to 60 months.
This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of FDA018-ADC in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. FDA018-ADC is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）during 35-day cycle with 3 doses. In addition, the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose for FDA018-ADC will be determined.
