Safety & Efficacy of Peg-ASP-based CCRT in Early Stage ENKTL
The purpose of this multi-center, single arm, phase â…¡ clinical trail is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy by using single-drug pegaspargase for patients with ENKTL in stage IE to IIE.
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Pegaspargase combined with concurrent radiotherapy.
PFS, progression free survival (PFS) rate, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 years
OS, two-year overall survival rate, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 years|CRR, complete response rate, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks
The treatment regimen included CCRT ( involved field radiotherapy 50GY, concurrent 2 cycles of pegaspargase treatment ) followed by 4 cycles of pegaspargase. Chemotherapy and RT were performed simultaneously within one week after enrollment. The administration regimen was as follows : day1, deep intramuscular injection of 2500 unit/m2 pegaspargase at three different sites, and repeated once every 3 weeks. 3D conformal radiotherapy was performed using 4 or 6 MV photons generated by a linear accelerator. The radiation dose was 50 Gy, 2.0 Gy / time, 1 time / d, for 5 weeks. The clinical target volume ( CTV ) of limited stage IE patients was defined as bilateral nasal cavity, bilateral ethmoid sinus and ipsilateral maxillary sinus. The CTV of extensive stage IE patients was extended to the affected tissues. The CTV of stage IIE lesions also included the involved cervical lymph node area.
