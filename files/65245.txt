The addition of ponatinib to mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy and venetoclax will improve the complete remission rate in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Leukemia
DRUG: Ponatinib|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Mini-hyper CVD
To determine the complete remission (CR) / CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate with the combination of Ponatinib and mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy and venetoclax., through study completion, an average of 1 year
OBJECTIVES

The addition of ponatinib to mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy and venetoclax will improve the complete remission rate in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Primary Objective:

To assess complete remission (CR) / CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate with the combination of Ponatinib and mini-hyper-CVD chemotherapy and venetoclax.

Secondary Objectives:

To assess the safety of the regimen To assess rate of measurable residual disease (MRD) negative remission To assess duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

Exploratory Objectives:

To assess the level of phospho-LCK in pretreatment samples and correlation with the To assess expression of BCL-2 family proteins
