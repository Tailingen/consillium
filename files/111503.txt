To Evaluate Efficacy of RAD001 as Monotherapy for the Treatment of Papillary Renal Cancer. Efficacy is Defined as the Percentage of Patients Progression-free at 6 Months., PFSR at 6 months based on central review, 6 mos
Disease Control Rate (SD + PR + CR), DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD and ORR as the percentage of patients with CR or PR, 6 mos|Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression, End of trial|Duration of Response, The DOR analysis applied only to patients whose overall response was CR or PR and was defined as the time from onset of response (CR/PR) to progression or death from any cause., End of trial|Median Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from first study drug administration to objective tumor progression or death from any cause., End of trial|Incidence of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Death., End of trial
