Effects of Different Ventilation Patterns on Lung Injury
In 1967, the term "respirator lung" was coined to describe the diffuse alveolar infiltrates and hyaline membranes that were found on postmortem examination of patients who had undergone mechanical ventilation.This mechanical ventilation can aggravate damaged lungs and damage normal lungs. In recent years, Various ventilation strategies have been used to minimize lung injury, including low tide volume, higher PEEPs, recruitment maneuvers and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. which have been proved to reduce the occurrence of lung injury.

In 2012,Needham et al. proposed a kind of lung protective mechanical ventilation, and their study showed that limited volume and pressure ventilation could significantly improve the 2-year survival rate of patients with acute lung injury.Volume controlled ventilation is the most commonly used method in clinical surgery at present.Volume controlled ventilation(VCV) is a time-cycled, volume targeted ventilation mode, ensures adequate gas exchange. Nevertheless, during VCV, airway pressure is not controlled.Pressure controlled ventilation（PCV） can ensure airway pressure,however minute ventilation is not guaranteed.Pressure controlled ventilation-volume guarantee(PCV-VG) is an innovative mode of ventilation utilizes a decelerating flow and constant pressure. Ventilator parameters are automatically changed with each patient breath to offer the target VT without increasing airway pressures. So PCV-VG has the advantages of both VCV and PCV to preserve the target minute ventilation whilst producing a low incidence of barotrauma pressure-targeted ventilation.

Current studies on PCV-VG mainly focus on thoracic surgery, bariatric surgery and urological surgery, and the research indicators mainly focus on changes in airway pressure and intraoperative oxygenation index.The age of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection is generally higher, the cardiopulmonary reserve function is decreased, and the influence of intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure and low head position increases the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications.Whether PCV-VG can reduce the incidence of intraoperative lung injury and postoperative pulmonary complications in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, and thereby improve postoperative recovery of these patients is still unclear.
