Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) Activity in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
The Activity of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is studied.
CLL
IDO activity and expression measured by kynurenine/tryptophan ratio in serum and by PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells., Indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase (IDO) activity in patients with CLL was measured by the serum kynurenine/tryptophan (kyn/trp) ratio and - the expression of INDO (encoding IDO enzyme) and INDOL1 (encoding IDO2 enzyme) genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells via TaqMan real-time PCR., 3 months
The Activity of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)is studied in patients and healthly controls.
