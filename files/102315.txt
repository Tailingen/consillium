Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Allo GDA-201 Natural Killer (NK) Cells in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B Cell NHL
This is an open-label, non-randomized, interventional, single group assignment study of GDA-201, an allogeneic cryopreserved Natural Killer (NK) cell therapy derived from donor peripheral blood, in combination with rituximab, monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, for patients with relapsed or refractory B Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: GDA-201
Phase I: Safety as Determined by Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs defined as one of the following within the first 28 days of the first dose of GDA-201 by the NCI-CTCAE v 5.0. acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) will be assessed according to the Consensus Conference on aGvHD grading:

Steroid refractory Grade II aGvHD, defined as GvHD that does not respond to at least 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent of prednisone within 7 days of initiating therapy Grade III or IV aGvHD Grade 4 infusion reaction Grade 4 or 5 related adverse event (AE) Grade 3 or above cardiac, central nervous system or pulmonary adverse event. Any Grade 3 or above non-hematologic adverse event that does not resolve to Grade 2 or below within 72 hours, except for renal or hepatic adverse events which may take up to 7 days to resolve Treatment emergent â‰¥Grade 3 autoimmune disorder Grade 3 or above allergic reaction that does not recover to Grade II or below within 24 hours Grade 4 cytopenia lasting beyond Day 42 (the 28-day DLT observation period will be extend, Day 28|Phase II: Overall Response Rate, Patients will be assessed after the infusion of GDA-201 for level of response., up to 1 year
The study is divided into a phase I dose escalation phase and a phase II expansion phase.

Patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)/high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) will receive GDA-201 followed by a short course of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Rituximab will be administered prior to and after GDA-201 infusion.

Phase I: Dose escalation phase The objective of Phase I is to evaluate the safety of GDA-201 in patients with FL, DLBCL/ HGBCL, marginal zone lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be determined based on dose limiting toxicities (DLT).

Phase II expansion phase The objective of the Phase II expansion cohort is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GDA-201 in two patient cohorts, FL and DLBCL/HGBCL.
