Cytoplasmic Activated PD-1 CAR T Cells in Refractory/Relapsed B Cell Lymphoma
Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CAR19 T cells carrying cytoplasmic activated PD1 in patients with refractory relapsed B-cell lymphoma
Relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: CAR19 T cells carrying cytoplasmic activated PD-1
safety: occurrence of study related adverse events, occurrence of study related adverse events, 6 months
objective response rate, tumor burdens shrink more than 30 percent by RECIST1.1, 3 months and 6 months
Although CAR19 T cell therapy brings hope, the patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell lymphoma is still a problem for the current treatment. There are still some patients with poor therapeutic efficacy, and the efficacy of CAR19-T cell therapy remains to be improved. Basic research shows that there is a synergistic effect between CAR-T cell therapy and anti-PD1 pathway, and it did have efficacy in clinic. However, the regimen of CAR19-T cells combined anti-PD1 inhibitors need to be combined with the application of anti-PD1 antibody and culture of CART cells during the treatment, there may be adverse events to PD1 antibodies. In this study, CAR19T cells carrying cytosolic activated PD1 possess the dual effects of CAR19T cells and anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies while overcoming the adverse events of anti-PD1 inhibitors, and might have better efficacy than conventional CAR19T cells plus anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment, with fewer side effects.
