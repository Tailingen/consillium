A Study of KRN23 in Subjects With Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia or Epidermal Nevus Syndrome
Before switching to the post-marketing study:

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRN23 after its 144-week once every 4 weeks (Q4W) repeated SC administration to Japanese and Korean patients with TIO or ENS by a multicenter, open-label, intraindividual dose adjustment study.

After switching to the post-marketing study:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of KRN23, which is switched from the investigational product to the post-marketing investigational product, at the approved dose and dosing regimen in subjects who continue treatment after the marketing approval of KRN23 in Japan.
