HS-20089 Combination Treatment in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
HS-20089 is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized IgG1 anti-B7-H4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a protease-cleavable linker, with an average drug-to-antibody ratio of about 6.

This is a phase Ⅰ, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of HS-20089 in combination with other antitumor agents (Adebrelimab with or without platinum; Bevacizumab with or without platinum) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HS-20089|DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin / carboplatin
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum applicable dose (MAD) of HS-20089 in combination therapy, To determine the MTD or MAD of HS-20089 in each combination therapy., Up to day 21 from the first dose
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), AEs will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0. Incidence and severity of AEs are assessed according to vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram, etc., From the first dose to 90 days after the end of treatment|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-20089, Cmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20089 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose of HS-20089 on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of HS-20089 following the first dose, Tmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20089 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to last sampling time (AUC0-t) following the first dose of HS-20089, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last sampling time when the concentration is no less than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). AUC0-t will be calculated according to the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) after single dose of HS-20089, AUC0-∞ will be calculated by combining AUC0-t and AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast/ λz, where Clast is the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above the LLQ and λz is the apparent terminal rate constant determined by log-linear regression analysis of the measured plasma concentrations of the terminal log-linear phase., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), assessed by investigators based on RECIST 1.1., From the first dose up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first (assessed up to 24 months).|Duration of response (DoR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, DoR is defined as the period from the first occurrence of CR or PR to progressive disease (PD) or death of any cause. If no PD or death after CR/PR, the cut-off date of progression-free survival (PFS) will be used., From the first dose to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first (assessed up to 24 months).|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of confirmed CR, PR and stable disease (SD)., From the first dose to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first (assessed up to 24 months).|Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from first dose or randomization (if any) to PD or death of any cause., From the first dose or randomization to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first (assessed up to 24 months).|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose or randomization (if any) to death of any cause., From the first dose or randomization to death or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.|Percentage of participants with antibodies to HS-20089 in serum, Serum samples will be collected for the determination of anti-drug antibody (ADA) at designated time points., From the first dose to 90 days after the end of treatment.
This study contains four combination therapy cohorts, each consisting of a dose exploration part and a dose expansion part.

The dose exploration part will explore the corresponding optimal dose level of HS-20089 in each combination therapy. The dose expansion part will be conducted at 1 or 2 safe and potentially effective dose levels in subjects with selected tumors in each cohort.

The cohorts may be adjusted based on the observed clinical results, translational medicine data and research progress in the field.
