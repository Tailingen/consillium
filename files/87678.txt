A Phase II Study of Neo-Adjuvant Gemcitabine, Cisplatin and Bevacizumab in Stage IIIA (N2) Non-Squamous Cell Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Background:

* Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with lung cancer, and cure after resection generally depends on whether lymph nodes are involved. A patient with Stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer has cancer in the lymph nodes involving the center of the chest (mediastinum).
* Studies have shown that surgery alone as a treatment for Stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer is not as effective as chemotherapy followed by surgery.
* Giving chemotherapy upfront may prevent the spread of Stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer tumors, and may shrink the tumors to allow adequate surgery to be performed. It is also thought that chemotherapy is usually better tolerated before major surgery than after, so higher doses can be given.

Objectives:

* To determine the effectiveness of the combination of three anti-cancer drugs (gemcitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab) given before surgery.
* To find out what effects this drug combination may have on the patient and the cancer.
* To determine if the combination of all three drugs given prior to surgery is more effective and as safe, safer, or less safe than other drug combinations given before surgery.

Eligibility:

* Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer who have not had chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to treat the cancer.

Design:

* Evaluations before the treatment period to determine eligibility:
* Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant.
* Tests to evaluate heart and lung function, such as an echocardiogram.
* Blood and urine tests.
* Disease evaluation with computed tomography (CT), chest X-ray, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and bronchoscopy/mediastinoscopy (examinations of the inside of the chest and lungs).
* Treatment with intravenous gemcitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab for three 21-day cycles.
* Cycles 1 and 2 - Gemcitabine on day 1 and day 8, cisplatin on day 1, bevacizumab on day 1.
* Cycle 3 - Gemcitabine on day 1 and day 8, cisplatin on day 1 (no bevacizumab).
* Physical examinations and tests will be conducted throughout each cycle.
* Surgery will take place 4 to 6 weeks after the last cycle if heart and lung functions are satisfactory and if the cancer remains stable.
* Chemotherapy (four 21-day cycles of cisplatin and etoposide treatments), further evaluations and examinations, and followup studies will take place 4 to 8 weeks after the surgery.
NSCLC|Stage IIIA (N2)
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|PROCEDURE: Surgery|DRUG: Etoposide
Rate of Pathologic Complete Response, Complete response is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and was assessed by the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria., 25 weeks
Number of Participants With Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Here is the number of participants with adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned. For the detailed list of adverse events see the adverse event module., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 38 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time between the first day of treatment to the day of disease progression. Progression will be assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., The time between the first day of treatment to the day of disease progression|Median Survival, Median survival is the length of time a participant lives with disease following treatment., Length of time a participant lives with disease following treatment|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time between the first day of treatment to the day of death., The time between the first day of treatment to the day of death
Background:

* Stage IIIA-N2 is considered one of the most therapeutically challenging and controversial subsets of lung cancer. This heterogenous group of patients have tumors which range from minimal N2 (found incidentally during or after surgery) to multi-station bulky N2 disease. The extent of mediastinal involvement has an inverse correlation with survival.
* The 5-year survival ranges from 5-8% in patients with bulky N2 disease, to nearly 35% in patients with single station, microscopic N2 involvement.
* Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy have been shown to be superior to surgery alone.
* Platinum-based induction chemotherapy in early and locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) results in a radiological down-staging in at least 50% of patients, and a pathological complete response rate of approximately 5%.
* Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy as an induction regimen increases the radiological and pathological down-staging rate, but at the cost of increasing the morbidity and mortality of a surgical intervention.
* Expectations have now turned towards a possible incremental effect of adding a targeted biological agent to a standard induction treatment.

Primary Objectives:

* To determine the safety of neo-adjuvant Gemcitabine/Cisplatin and Bevacizumab in stage IIIA-N2 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
* To determine the pathological complete response rate
* To determine the resectability rate
* To determine the extent of surgery

Eligibility:

* Histologically confirmed stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC (non-squamous)
* No previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or biological therapy for lung cancer
* Adequate organ and bone marrow function

Design:

* Multi-center, international (United States Of America (USA)/Croatia), open labeled phase II trial
* Following a Simon two-stage optimal design
