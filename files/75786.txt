Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) With Carboplatin in Second-line Treatment of Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα) Expressing, Platinum-sensitive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
IMGN853-0420 is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of carboplatin plus mirvetuximab soravtansine followed by mirvetuximab soravtansine continuation in folate receptor-alpha positive, recurrent platinum sensitive, high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer following 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.
High Grade Ovarian Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: Mirvetuximab soravtansine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR following carboplatin plus MIRV combination as measured by the investigator and assessed according to RECIST v1.1, defined as the proportion of confirmed responders (CR or PR) among participants with FRα expression of ≥ 50% of tumor cells with staining at ≥ 2+ intensity (PS2+) who have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 at inclusion.

o ORR following carboplatin plus MIRV combination will also be measured, as a sensitivity analysis, by a blinded independent central review (BICR) in the same participant population, Up to 3 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of confirmed responders (CR or PR) following carboplatin plus MIRV combination, as measured by the investigator and assessed according to RECIST v1.1, among patients with FRα expression of ≥ 25% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining intensity who have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 at inclusion.

o ORR will also be measured by a BICR, as a sensitivity analysis, in the same patient population., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from first response to radiological progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first, following carboplatin plus MIRV followed by MIRV continuation by the investigator and assessed according to RECIST v1.1 among efficacy evaluable participants:

* with FRα expression of ≥ 50% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining and
* with FRα expression of ≥ 25% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining
* DOR in the above populations will also be measured by BICR, Up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS as measured by the investigator and by BICR in participants with

* FRα expression of ≥ 25% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining, Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS in participants with

* FRα expression of ≥ 50% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining and
* FRα of ≥ 25% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining, Up to 3 years|Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 Response, CA-125 response as measured by the investigator, per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG), in the efficacy evaluable participants with

* FRα expression of ≥ 50% of tumor cells with PS2+ staining and

This Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MIRV in combination with carboplatin followed by MIRV continuation in FRα-positive participants with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) following 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy. Upon completion of carboplatin plus MIRV combination chemotherapy (6 cycles), participants without progressive disease will continue on single-agent MIRV. Participants must have confirmation of FRα positivity by the Ventana folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) Assay.
