Study to Investigate the Safety, Blood Levels and Activity of MP0310 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MP0310, a DARPin® therapeutic candidate for tumor targeted activation of T cells, in patients with advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: MP0310
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, From signing of informed consent form (ICF) until 10 weeks following the last dose or start of new anticancer therapy.|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicities will be reviewed as a subset of AEs that occur within the first 21 days of dosing and meet the protocol-specified criteria., First 21 days of dosing.|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a tolerated dose below MTD (if MTD is not reached), Based on occurrence of DLTs within a 3+3 clinical trial design, From signing of ICF until 10 weeks following the last dose or start of new anticancer therapy.|Recommended expansion dose (RED), Based on incidence and nature of DLTs, and incidence, nature, and severity of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), From signing of ICF until 10 weeks following the last dose or start of new anticancer therapy.
