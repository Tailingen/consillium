Distinction Between Lung Cancer and Gynecological Cancers by Canine Scent Detection
Previous studies have shown that specially trained sniffer dogs are capable to discriminate breath samples of patients with lung cancer and healthy individuals. So far it is not known whether this differentiation is specific for lung cancer or just identifies any form of (solid) tumor. Therefore, the dog's ability to differentiate between lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer is tested.

OTHER: exhalation analysis of breath sample
Specificity for Lung Cancer, exhalation analysis by sniffer dogs is able to differentiate breath samples of patients with lung cancer from those of patients with other (tested) cancers, breath samples will be tested within 40 days after gathering
Discriminability of breast and ovarian cancer, exhalation analysis by sniffer dogs is able to differentiate breath samples of patients with breast cancer from those of patients with other ovarian cancer, breath samples will be tested within 40 days after gathering
