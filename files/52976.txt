A Retrospective Study of Newly-diagnosed PCNSL Treated With a Methotrexate (MTX) and Orelabrutinib-based Regimen
This study was a single-centre, retrospective study that retrospectively collected first-line PCNSL patients receiving methotrexate-based chemotherapy Â± orelabrutinib at Huashan Hospital of Fudan University. The study was divided into two retrospective cohorts, Cohort A was a cohort of patients receiving methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone, and Cohort B was a cohort of patients receiving methotrexate-based chemotherapy + orelabrutinib.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu or PR during induction therapy, At the end of induction therapy, Cycle 6-8 (each cycle is 28 days)
PFS, Progression-free survival is calculated from the date of start of therapy until the date of first documented progress or death due to any cause, Up to 2 years
The study was divided into two retrospective cohorts of approximately 35-40 patients each. Cohort A was the cohort of patients who received methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone, and cohort B was the cohort of patients who received methotrexate-based chemotherapy + orelabrutinib. Statistical analyses such as propensity score analysis (PSM) and inverse probability weighted (IPTW) analysis were performed, focusing on comparing and analysing the short-term efficacy data (ORR, CR) and long-term efficacy data (PFS, OS) of the two cohorts.
