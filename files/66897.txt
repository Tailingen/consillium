A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Enzalutamide in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of enzalutamide in participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as measured by overall survival (OS).

This study also evaluated the safety of enzalutamide; pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and the active metabolite N-desmethyl and Progression Free Survival (PFS) of enzalutamide as compared to placebo in participants with advanced HCC.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the documented date of death from any cause. Participants who were still alive at the time of the data cut-off date was censored on the last date known to be alive or at the data cutoff date, whichever occurs first. Results based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From date of randomization up to data cut-off date 02 Oct 2017 (approximately 22 months); median follow-up time was 14.65 months for enzalutamide and 13.83 for placebo.
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Safety was assessed by AEs, which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug or initiation of new treatment, whichever comes first. AEs were considered as serious if resulted in in death, was life-threatening resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization and other medically important events., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug median (minimum, maximum) treatment duration was 64.0 (6, 1736) days for enzalutamide and 64.0 (12, 490) for placebo|Plasma Trough Concentrations of Enzalutamide, Blood samples were collected for analysis., Predose at weeks 5, 9 and 13|Plasma Trough Concentrations N-desmethyl Enzalutamide (M2 Metabolite), Blood samples were collected for analysis., Predose at weeks 5, 9 and 13|Plasma Trough Concentrations of MDPC0001 (M1 Metabolite), Blood samples were collected for analysis., Predose at weeks 5, 9 and 13|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of documented radiographic disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as determined by the investigator or death from any cause on study, whichever occurred first. The earliest of the censoring times was used: Participants with (1) no evaluable postbaseline imaging assessments or did not die were censored at the randomization date; (2) no radiographical progression or did not die before analysis cutoff date were censored at the last radiological assessment date before analysis cutoff date; (3) with no radiographical progression or did not die before new HCC treatment was censored at the last radiological assessment date before start of new HCC treatment. Based on Kaplan-Meier., From date of randomization up to data cut-off date 02 Oct 2017 (approximately 22 months); median follow-up time was 14.65 months for enzalutamide and 13.83 for placebo.
