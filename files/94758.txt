Dual SSTR2 and Integrin αvβ3 Targeting PET/CT Imaging
This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluate the efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD in lung cancer patients and neuroendocrine neoplam patients. A single dose of 111-185 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-3P-TATE-RGD will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.
Lung Cancer|Neuroendocrine Neoplasm
DRUG: 68Ga-NOTA-3P-TATE-RGD
Standardized uptake value of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD in lung cancer and Neuroendocrine Neoplasm, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tracer in breast cancer will be measured., 1 year
The number of somatostatin receptors may be greatly up-regulated in the cells of a variety of tumor including carcinoids, gastrinomas, paragangliomas, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Octreotide is an eight amino acid cyclic peptide that preserves a four amino acid motif (Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr) that is critical for the biological activity of somatostatin (SSTR). On the other hand, the RGD moiety binds with integrin αvβ3, also plays an important role in the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis, local invasiveness, and metastatic potential in human tumor. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide TATE-RGD was synthesized from TATE and RGD through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD PET/CT in evaluation of lung cancer and neuroendocrine neoplams.
