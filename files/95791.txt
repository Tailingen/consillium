The Safety and Efficacy of TWP-101 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a multi-center, phase Ia/Ib, open clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TWP-101 in patients with advanced solid tumor. This study consists of two parts (Part A and Part B). Part A was a dose escalation study, and Part B was a dose expansion study.
