A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Tolerance of Caelyx in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. (Study P04072)(COMPLETED)
The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability, and number of positive response to treatment with CAELYX (50 mg/m\^2), administered as monotherapy once per 4 weeks to patients with metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, resistant to previous platinum therapy.
Ovarian Neoplasms
DRUG: Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin hydrochloride
Number of Participants With Complete Response, Complete response was defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and assessable disease with no new disease or disease-related symptoms as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging., 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed|Number of Participants With Partial Response, Required 50 percent or greater decrease in sum of products of all bidimensionally measurable lesions without progression of assessable disease and no new lesions as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging., 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed|Number of Participants With Stabilization, All other subjects (except complete or partial responders and those with progression \[see prior definitions\]) were classified as stable disease as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging., 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed|Number of Participants With Progression, Progressive disease was defined as 25% or greater increase in the size of measurable lesion. The reappearance of any lesion or clear worsening of assessable disease or the appearance of any new lesion was also considered as progressive disease as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging., 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed
Mean Time to Positive (Partial) Treatment Response Achievement, Time to the occurence of partial effect achievement as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Partial response required a 50 percent or greater decrease in the sum of the products of all bidimensionally measurable lesions without progression of any assessable disease and no new lesions., from the beginning of study drug administration up to 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed|Median Time to Progression, Median time to the occurence of progression. Progression was defined as 25 percent or greater increase size of measurable lesion. Reappearance of lesion, worsening of assessable disease or appearance new lesions were considered progression as measured by chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging., from the beginning of study drug administration up to 4 weeks after chemotherapy completed|Mean Survival Time During the Study, Mean time to the occurrence of death, from the beginning of study drug administration up to 18 months
The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability, and number of positive response to treatment with CAELYX (50 mg/m\^2), administered as monotherapy once per 4 weeks to patients with metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, resistant to previous platinum therapy.
