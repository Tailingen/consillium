Effect and Prognosis of Immunohistochemical Biomarkers Changes in Patients With Bladder Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Clinical trial to investigate the relationship between the expression of immunohistochemical biomarkers GATA-3, CK20, P53 and Ki67 in bladder cancer and pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Bladder Cancer
OTHER: neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Expression of immunohistochemical biomarkers GATA-3, CK20, P53 and Ki67, 1 year|Tumor regression grade, 1 year
This is a retrospective study included bladder cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We analyzed the changes in the expression of GATA-3, CK20, P53 and Ki67 before and after NAC. Evaluating the sensitivity factor for predicting pathological complete response.
