Dose-Escalation and Expansion Trial of NC-6300 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The goal of this study is to find the highest tolerated dose of NC-6300 that can be given to patients with advanced solid tumors or soft tissue sarcoma. The safety and tolerability of the drug will also be studied.

The first part of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and the recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of NC-6300. The second part of the study will assess the activity and tolerability of NC-6300 in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
