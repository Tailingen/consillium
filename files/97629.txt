Study Evaluating the Safety Of HKI-272 (Neratinib) In Subjects With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn whether HKI-272 is safe and effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: HKI-272
Objective Response Rate for Neratinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Objective response rate as reported by Independent Assessment (radiographic review by independent radiologists) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions., From first dose date to progression/death or last tumor assessment, up to three years.
Clinical Benefit Rate for Neratinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Clinical benefit rate is the percentage of patients with Partial or Complete Response, or with Stable Disease \>= 12 Weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., From first dose date to progression/death or last tumor assessment, up to three years.|Duration of Response for Neratinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Measured from the time at which measurement criteria were first met for CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first), until the date of first recurrence, PD, or death was objectively documented, taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since enrollment, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions., From start date of response to first PD, assessed up to three years after the first randomization.|Progression Free Survival for Neratinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Defined as the interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence or progression, or death due to any cause, is documented, censored at the last assessable evaluation or at the initiation of new anticancer therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v 1.0 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From first dose date to progression/death, assessed up to three years.
