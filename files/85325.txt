Efficacy of Parecoxib Combined With Paracetamol in Mastectomy
Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery experience persistent pain after surgery and subsequent development of chronic pain. Parecoxib or paracetamol has been reported to reduce postoperative pain in mastectomy. The investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of the perioperative administration of parecoxib combined with paracetamol to reduce postoperative acute and subacute breast surgical pain.

Patients with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy experience moderate postoperative pain which may persist for more than 3 months and may turn into chronic pain. This may interfere with the daily life of the patients. Proper prophylaxis and management to control postoperative pain are essential. Morphine is the most common drug to control postoperative pain. However, there are many serious side effects, e.g., nausea/vomiting, pruritus, ileus, constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression. Multimodal analgesia comprises the use of a combination of drugs to provide the opioid-sparing effect. Parecoxib, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, and intravenous paracetamol are reported to provide good postoperative analgesia. The investigators aim to apply a combination of parecoxib and paracetamol perioperatively to reduce postoperative morphine consumption.
