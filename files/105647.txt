Prospective Analysis of Changes in Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) and Amount of Fibroglandular Tissue on Breast MRI
Tamoxifen is a hormonal treatment for breast cancer. It prevents recurrent disease and decreases death. Tamoxifen is given to women with and at high risk for breast cancer. These women also commonly have breast MRI to monitor for breast cancer. Some features of normal breast tissue visible on breast MRI change depending on patient hormonal status. It has been questioned if hormonal changes due to tamoxifen are seen on breast MRI. Pilot data suggests this is true. If tamoxifen causes changes in normal breast tissue on MRI, more study could be done looking at whether breast MRI could tell us anything about whether tamoxifen is working.

This study is being done to see if tamoxifen changes normal breast tissue on MRI. It will also look at if other factors like taking anti-depressants or gene type have any effect.

To compare the level of BPE on breast MRI, on breast MRI in premenopausal patients with breast cancer before and during 9-12 months on tamoxifen to determine whether tamoxifen results in a significant decrease in BPE and/or amount of fibroglandular tissue, 3 years
