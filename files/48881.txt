Vatalanib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma That Cannot be Removed by Surgery
RATIONALE: Vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vatalanib works in treating patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: vatalanib
Response rate as assessed by RECIST every 8 weeks
Time to progression|Survival at 6 months and 1 year|Overall survival|Toxicity as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0 at 2 weeks and then every 4 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic cutaneous melanoma treated with vatalanib.

Secondary

* To determine the time to progression in these patients.
* To determine the 6-month and 1-year survival of these patients.
* To determine the overall survival of these patients.
* To determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then periodically thereafter.
