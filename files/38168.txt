A Prospective Cohort Study on the Treatment of Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
The clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab combined with the SOX regimen and HIPEC in treating locally advanced gastric cancer. The primary and secondary objectives are as follows:

To evaluate the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer treated with systemic SOX chemotherapy plus Tislelizumab and HIPEC.

To assess the major pathological response (MPR) in these patients. Secondary objectives include safety, pathological complete response (pCR), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor regression grade (TRG), overall survival (OS), incidence of adverse reactions during treatment, postoperative adverse reactions, and treatment efficacy.

Participants will:

Be willing to receive SOX plus Tislelizumab combined with HIPEC treatment (exposure group), undergo HIPEC followed by SOX and Tislelizumab to achieve stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR). Patients who can undergo surgery after the second exploration will receive surgery and HIPEC treatment. If surgery is not possible, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion will follow to determine the next treatment plan. Patients with progressive disease (PD) will also have an MDT discussion to determine the subsequent treatment.

Be willing to receive SOX combined with HIPEC treatment (observation group), undergo HIPEC followed by SOX to achieve SD, PR, or CR. Patients who can undergo surgery after the second exploration will receive surgery and HIPEC treatment. If surgery is not possible, an MDT discussion will follow to determine the next treatment plan. Patients with PD will also have an MDT discussion to determine the subsequent treatment.

Treatment details:

SOX: S-1 dosage based on body surface area (BSA): \<1.25m², 40 mg bid orally, 1.25-1.5m², 50 mg bid orally, ≥1.5m², 60mg bid orally, days 1-14; Q3W; Oxaliplatin 130mg/m² IV day 1, for a total of 3 cycles.

Tislelizumab: 200mg IV, day 1, Q3W, for a total of 3 cycles. HIPEC: Docetaxel: 120mg, day 1, day 3.
