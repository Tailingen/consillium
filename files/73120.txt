Efficacy of Oxycodone/Naloxone(OXN), Versus Oxycodone (OXY), for the Reduction of Intensity of Opioid-induced Constipation in Pain Patients
The primary objective of this trial is to study the efficacy of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release tablets (OXN PR), compared to oxycodone prolonged release tablets (Oxy PR), for the reduction of the intensity of opioid-induced constipation symptoms in patients treated for cancer or non-cancer pain.
Constipation|Pain
DRUG: Oxycodone Naloxone|DRUG: Oxycodone PR Tablets
Change of intensity of constipation symptoms, as assessed by the BFI from baseline to Day 28. The BFI is the mean value of 3 single items: Ease of defecation; Feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation; Personal judgement of constipation., 28 days
Change of BFI from baseline (bl) to Days 7,14,21. Change of PAC-SYM score from bl to Days 7,14,21,28. Change of KESS score from bl to Days 7,14,21,28. Frequency of laxative medication use between Day 0 & Day 28. Change of pain as assessed by BPI-SF, Days 7, 14 and 21
Eligible patients with documented cancer or non-cancer pain, either currently receiving a WHO step II opioid and requiring the initiation of a WHO step III opioid or currently receiving a WHO step III opioid, and having opioid-related constipation defined by either a KESS score ≥9 or the current use of laxatives (≥3 times per week), will be randomly assigned to receive either OXN PR or Oxy PR. Randomisation will be stratified on the cause of pain: cancer or non-cancer.

Any patient having completed the study and wishing to receive OXN PR afterwards may enter an optional open extension phase. During this phase, all patients will receive OXN PR and be managed as per the usual practice in the center until commercial OXN PR is available in France (with a limit of 1 year after Day 28). Adverse events will be assessed at each visit.
