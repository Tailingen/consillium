Trial of Dacarbazine With or Without Genasense in Advanced Melanoma
This study is being performed to prospectively determine whether dacarbazine plus Genasense is significantly better than dacarbazine plus placebo in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma and low baseline LDH (LDH less than or equal to 0.8 times the upper limit of normal). LDH is a biomarker strongly associated with improved outcomes in a recent trial of dacarbazine plus Genasense.
