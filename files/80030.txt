Baseline value is defined as the last value or measurement taken prior to the first dose in the study, at Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1|Spleen Response Rate by Palpation, Spleen response rate by palpation is the percentage of participants with a spleen response according to the IWG-MRT 2013 at the end of Cycle 6 as compared to baseline. This will be calculated for participants that have an enlarged spleen (≥ 5 cm below LCM) at baseline. Participants with a missing spleen size assessment at the end of Cycle 6 including those who meet the criteria for progression of splenomegaly before the end of Cycle 6 will be considered not to be responders., From First Dose to end of Cycle 6 (approximately 168 days)|Symptom Response Rate, Symptom response rate (SRR) is defined as the percentage of participants with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline to the end of Cycle 6 in total symptom score (TSS) measured by MFSAF version 4.0. The TSS will be defined as the sum of each of the 7 symptom scores. Participants without a baseline TSS \> 0 will be considered non-evaluable (due to no place for symptom reduction) for the SRR analysis. Participants with a missing TSS at the end of Cycle 6 or who had disease progression before the end of the Cycle 6 will be considered non-responders., From First Dose to end of Cycle 6 (approximately 168 days)|Durability of Spleen Volume Response by MRI/CT (DR), Durability of spleen volume response (DR) by MRI/CT is defined as time from the first documented spleen response (ie, ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume) to the date of subsequent progressive disease (PD) (ie, ≥ 25% increase in spleen volume from baseline) or death, whichever is earlier. In the absence an event (ie, subsequent spleen volume reduction \< 35% before the analysis is performed), the DR will be censored at the date of the last valid assessment performed before the analysis performed date. Durability of spleen volume response by MRI/CT scan will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method., From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose (Approximately an average of 59.40 Weeks)|Durability of Spleen Response by Palpation (DRP), Durability of spleen response by palpation (DRP) is defined as time from the date of first documented palpable spleen response, according to the IWG-MRT 2013 to the date of subsequent PD according to the IWG-MRT 2013 or death, whichever is earlier. Durability of spleen response by palpation according to the IWG-MRT 2013 criteria will be calculated for subjects that have an enlarged spleen at baseline (≥ 5 cm below LCM), and that have a spleen response by palpation. In the absence of an event (ie, no loss of spleen response by palpation) before the analysis is performed, the DRP will be censored at the date of the last valid assessment performed before the analysis performed date. Durability of spleen response by palpation will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method., From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose (Approximately an average of 59.32 Weeks)|Durability of Symptom Response (DSR), Durability of symptoms response is defined as time from the first documented response in TSS (ie, reduction in TSS ≥ 50%) measured by MFSAF version 4.0 to the first documented TSS reduction \< 50%. In the absence of TSS reduction \< 50% before the analysis performed, the DSR will be censored at the date of the last valid assessment performed before the analysis performed date., From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose (Approximately an average of 31.33 Weeks)|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher AEs: Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea and Encephalopathy Including Wernicke's., Number of participants with grade 3 or higher AEs: Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea and Encephalopathy including Wernicke's., From first dose to end of treatment (an average of 50.3 weeks up to a maximum of 124 weeks)|Number of Participants With Thiamine Levels < Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)., Number of participants with thiamine levels \< LLN.

ULN of thiamine is 180 nmol/L., At Cycle 1, 2, 3, and every 3 cycles afterwards till End of Treatment (an average of 50.3 weeks up to a maximum of 124 weeks)|Number of Participants With Clinically Notable Laboratory Results, Grade 3 or 4, Number of participants with clinically notable laboratory results, Grade 3 or 4, From first dose up to 30 days post last dose.

This is Single-Arm, Open-Label Efficacy and Safety Trial of Fedratinib in Subjects with DIPSS (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System)-Intermediate or High- Risk Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) and Previously Treated with Ruxolitinib.

The spleen volume reduction at the end of Cycle 6 as the primary objective. The secondary objectives of the study are to further evaluate the safety and to assess and implement mitigation strategies for WE and for gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events.

The study will be at multiple centers to provide access to a broad population and have assurance the results are likely to have general applicability.

This is also conducted as an open-label study to collect efficacy and safety data with fedratinib use, no randomization or stratification will occur.
