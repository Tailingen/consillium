Prime-boost Vaccine Study in Women With Low-grade Cervical HPV Lesions
A Phase 1b/2 multi-centre study evaluating the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccines ChAdOx1-HPV and MVA-HPV in women with HPV related low grade cervical lesions.
HPV Infection|CIN1
BIOLOGICAL: ChAdOx1-HPV|BIOLOGICAL: MVA-HPV|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Incidence of adverse events to measure safety and reactogenicity, Measure of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), â‰¥Grade 3 study vaccine-related adverse events reported., 3 months for the lead-in and 12 months for the main phase
Determine the dose of ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines for further development, Measurement of the highest multi-parameter index made of CD4+ magnitude, CD4+ avidity and CD8+ magnitude at peak timepoint, 3 months for lead in phase and 12 months for main phase|Determine the effect of ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines on the clearance of high risk HPV infection, The percentage of hrHPV infection clearance, 12 months for main phase only|Determine the effect of ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), The percentage of cervical lesions cleared as determined by colposcopy, 12 months for main phase only
Assess the complex cellular immune response generated by ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines, This will be assessed by measuring the individual phenotypic subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination, 3 months for lead in phase and 12 months for main phase|Assess the complex cellular immune response generated by ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines, This will be assessed by measuring the innate immune response after vaccination compared to baseline, 3 months for lead in phase and 12 months for main phase|Assess the complex cellular immune response generated by ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines, This will be assessed by measuring the T cell breadth of response to the components of the ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines, 3 months for lead in phase and 12 months for main phase|Assess the complex cellular immune response generated by ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV vaccines, Immune responses after prime and boost vaccinations in cytobrush samples compared to baseline, 3 months for lead in phase and 12 months for main phase
The study consists of an open label, non-randomised, dose escalation Lead in phase. 9 participants with high-risk HPV, in cohorts of 3 in 3 dose ascending groups, will be vaccinated after SMC safety data reviews.

This is followed by a blinded, randomised Main phase with 96 participants with high-risk HPV, in parallel running dose cohorts (three different doses of ChAdOx1-HPV plus two different doses of MVA-HPV versus placebo plus placebo boost). At least 60 of these participants will take part in the immunogenicity sub-study.

A blinded, randomised expansion phase investigating the effects of up to two different main phase doses against placebo will be further defined prior to commencing this phase of the study.
