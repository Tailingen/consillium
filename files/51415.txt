During standard of care surgery tumour samples which are surplus to the requirements of the patients diagnostic/treatment pathway will be procured along with a matched whole blood and/or leukapheresis sample.

Within 28-42 days following procurement of samples patients will be required to participate in a safety follow up call for assessment of any procedure related adverse events.
