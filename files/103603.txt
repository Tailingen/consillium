3-5 FrAction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Palliation of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: the FAST Phase II Randomized Trial
To learn if it is effective to use advanced radiation treatment techniques (stereotactic radiation or "SBRT") to safely deliver a strong dose of radiation to your tumor in a shorter period of time than would typically be feasible with traditional methods.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy|RADIATION: Traditional Palliation
M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Head & Neck (MDASI-HN) Questionnaires, M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Head \& Neck (MDASI-HN) score range from 0/10

(0-symptom has not been present)0 to 10 (10-the symptom was as bad as you can imagine it could be), through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Objectives:

* To compare local progression-free survival following palliation with SBRT versus traditional fractionations in patients with HN SCC deemed ineligible for curative-intent treatment.
* To compare pain response, symptom burden, toxicity, local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival between the treatment modalities.
