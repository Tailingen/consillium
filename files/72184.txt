A Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Low Dose Cytarabine Versus Low Dose Cytarabine Alone in Treatment Naive Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are Ineligible for Intensive Chemotherapy
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if venetoclax when co administered with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) improves overall survival (OS) versus LDAC and placebo, in treatment-naïve patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. The PROMIS Fatigue 7a score is calculated as a T-score, which is a standardized score with a mean of 50 (based on the average for the United States general population) and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. A decrease in score (negative change from Baseline) indicates improvement in fatigue; the minimum important difference used in this study was 3 points., Baseline and Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, and 9|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status / Quality of Life, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (EORTC QLQ-C30) consists of a Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) scale, a Financial Difficulties scale, 5 functional scales (Cognitive, Social, Physical, Emotional, and Role Functioning), and 8 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Pain, Constipation, Diarrhea, Dyspnea, and Nausea and Vomiting).

The GHS/QoL scale includes 2 questions in which participants were asked to rate their overall health and overall quality of life during the past week on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The 2 scores were averaged and transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, where a high score represents a high QoL.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and rare cancer of myeloid cells (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what subtype of AML the patient has, and the age of the patient when diagnosed.

Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding venetoclax to cytarabine works better than cytarabine on its own.

This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment unknown to patients and doctors), placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with AML who are 18 or more years old and have not been treated before. Patients who take part in this study should not be suitable for intensive induction chemotherapy (usual starting treatment). Abbvie is funding this study which will take place at approximately 125 hospitals globally. In this study, 2/3 of patients will receive venetoclax every day with cytarabine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with cytarabine.

Participants will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires. Blood and bone marrow tests will be completed to see why some people respond better than others.
