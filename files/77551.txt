Consolidative Radiotherapy for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases Receiving Surgery or Radiofrequency Ablation
This study is a randomized phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant consolidative radiotherapy in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) patients after chemotherapy combined with surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions.

Disease free survival, Evaluate the effect of consolidative SBRT of liver lesions versus observation on disease free survival, 2 years
Overall survival, To evaluate overall survival after consolidative SBRT in comparison to observation alone, 5 years|Intrahepatic disease free survival, To evaluate Intrahepatic disease free survival after consolidative SBRT in comparison to observation alone, 2 years|Toxicities, Acute toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 criteria during and up to 3 months after radiotherapy. Late toxicity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria., 2 years
Liver metastases are detected in 40-50% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Local treatments like surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation result in 5-year survival of 35%. However, relapse still occurs in 70% of patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a valid treatment not only to provide excellent symptom palliation, but also is effective in local control of metastatic lesions and improves survival. The potential efficacy of SBRT as adjuvant radiotherapy in CRLM patients after surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation is still unknown.
