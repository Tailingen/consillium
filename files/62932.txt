Phase III Study of Surufatinib in Treating Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center Phase III study to assess the efficacy of Surufatinib 300 mg once a day in treating advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Surufatinib|OTHER: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), the duration between the randomization date and the first disease progression (PD) or death (whichever comes first)., 7 months after the last patient enrolled
The objective response rate of the tumor (ORR), the incidence of confirmed complete response or partial response, 7 months after the last patient enrolled|The disease control rate (DCR), the incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease, 7 months after the last patient enrolled|Duration of Response (DoR), the duration between the date the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail) and the date of disease recurrence or progression as objectively recorded, 7 months after the last patient enrolled|Time to Response (TTR), the period from the date of randomization to the date when the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail)., 7 months after the last patient enrolled|Overall survival (OS), the time from the date of randomization to the date of death (all causes), 7 months after the last patient enrolled|•adverse events evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03, The safety and tolerability of Surufatinib will be evaluated based on adverse events data. Other safety parameters include physical examination, vital signs, laboratory test results (i.e., hematology, chemistry panel, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and ultrasonic cardiogram., From first dose to within 30 days after the last dose
195 patients will be randomly assigned (in 2:1 ratio) to the Surufatinib or Placebo treatment group based on interactive web response system（IWRS).The patients will receive continuous oral treatment, every 28-day treatment cycle until progression of disease occurs, intolerable toxicity or other protocol specified end-o-treatment criteria is met. The tumor should be assessed every 8 weeks (+/-3 days) within the first year and every 12 weeks (+/-3 days) after the patient has been treated for one year.

A Blinded Independent Image Review Committee (BIIRC) will subsequently provide a central review of the oncologic imaging materials from the patients.

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be assembled to monitor safety and efficacy data, and evaluate interim analysis. If the interim analysis demonstrates overwhelming efficacy of the treatment arm with respect to PFS (primary endpoint) versus control arm, IDMC could recommend terminating and to unblinding the study and sulfatinib will be offered to the control arm patients who are still on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
