Safety and Tolerability Study of AutoSynVax™ Vaccine in Subjects With Advanced Cancer
Open-label Phase 1 study of AutoSynVax™ vaccine with QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant in subjects with advanced cancer
Advanced Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AutoSynVax™ vaccine
Incidence of Treatment-Emergence Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), AEs, irAEs, according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03., From first administration to 30 days from last dose.|Recommended dose for further development, After 2 doses (administered every 2 weeks), if there are \<2 treatment-limiting toxicities (TLTs) in the first 6 subjects, AutoSynVax™ vaccine will be considered safe for further development., 28 days from first dose
Overall survival (OS), Duration of survival, From first administration until death, or up to study duration (18 - 24 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), From time of first administration per RECIST v1.1, 6 Months after last dose is administered.|Objective response rate (ORR), From time of first administration per RECIST v1.1, 6 Months after last dose is administered.|T-cell response, T-cell response to tumor specific neo-epitopes in the vaccine, 6 Months after last administration.
This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the safety and tolerability of single-agent treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine with QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant in subjects with advanced cancer that is refractory to standard therapies and a life expectancy of ≥6 months from the time tissue is obtained. A minimum of 6 (≤20) subjects will be enrolled to receive every other week subcutaneous injection of 240 μg AutoSynVax™ vaccine + 50 μg QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant for up to 1 year.
