Niraparib Maintenance in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer at Neoadjuvant Setting
This study aims to evaluate the effects of niraparib in those who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent interval debulking surgery, with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and would also explore if there are any biomarkers, other than BRCA / HRD status and platinum sensitivity, that may help to identify those who may benefit from PARPi especially those who are HRD negative.

Despite cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, about 70% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer recur in the first 2 - 3 years. PARPi has been shown to be prolong survival in primary advanced ovarian cancer. However its role in neoadjuvant setting has not been fully evaluated.
