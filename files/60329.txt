Nintedanib in Molecularly Selected Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
There has been limited benefit with angiogenesis inhibitor drugs in molecularly unselected patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators propose that patients who are molecularly selected for treatment with nintedanib based on the presence of mutations in the following genes: VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-A, PDGFR-B, FGFR1-3, and TP53, will have clinically meaningful benefit in terms of response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore the investigators plan to correlate outcomes with specific mutations and evaluate mechanisms of resistance.

DRUG: Nintedanib
Response Rate (RR), * RR = Partial response plus complete response using RECIST 1.1
* Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
* Partial response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline of sum diameters, After 2 cycles of therapy (approximately Day 56)
Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease (PD) = at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, appearance of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, 12 months follow-up minimum|Response Rate by Mutation Type, At the time of response (approximately day 56)|Unique Genetic Variations Associated With Extreme Responders (Both Non-responders and Responders), Correlate baseline genetic mutations with treatment response and progression of disease, Baseline and at the time of response (approximately Day 56)|Genetic Mechanisms of Secondary Resistance, Genomic analysis at time of progression after treatment with nintedanib (after response (complete response/partial response/stable disease) lasting for 6 months or longer) will provide some unique insights into mechanisms underlying acquired resistance., At the time of progression (estimated to be 8 months)
