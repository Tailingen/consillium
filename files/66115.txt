Study of Chiauranib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Chiauranib, which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.

Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammation related kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms of clinical relevance.

Because of its broad preclinical anti-tumor efficacy and the potential to improve conventional TKI kinase inhibitor therapy in various cancer indications, Chiauranib has now entered phase Ib clinical trials.

This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, in the meantime, exploring the latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.
