Evaluation of PSMA-based PET as an Imaging Biomarker in Prostate Cancer
This research is being done to see if an investigational radioactive imaging agent (radiotracer) called 18F-DCFPyL can help us find prostate cancer at its original site in the prostate gland and in distant sites (bone, lymph nodes) in men diagnosed with prostate cancer before surgery.
Advanced Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Pelvic DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI
Response rate differences, To compare the detection , sextant localization and response of DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI before and after 2-3 months of ADT in men with biopsy-positive high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer., baseline and after 2-3 months
Biomarker changes, To compare DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI uptake in prostate cancer (quantified as per sextant SUVmax, SUVavg, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion DCFPyL uptake, DCFPyL uptake rate) as a reliable non-invasive imaging biomarker of PSMA expression following ADT as determined by qualitative and quantitative MRI-guided prostate biopsy core tissue immunohistochemical analysis. DCFPyL uptake will also be compared to other prostate cancer relevant marker expression levels (PSA, Ki-67, TMPRSS2-ERG) by immunohistochemical analysis., Baseline and at 2=3 months|Metabolic tumor uptake changes, To compare DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI uptake in primary prostate cancer (quantified as per sextant SUVmax, SUVavg, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion DCFPyL uptake, DCFPyL uptake rate) following ADT with standard clinical prognostic markers (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage) and with predictive model of pathologic stage., baseline and then at 2-3 months|Gene expression changes, To validate DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI uptake in prostate cancer (quantified as per sextant SUVmax, SUVavg, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion DCFPyL uptake, DCFPyL uptake rate) as a reliable non-invasive imaging biomarker of AR signaling following ADT as determined by AR gene set expression of biopsy core tissue specimens using qPCR., Baseline and then at 2-3 months|Nodal metastatic disease changes, To compare the detection of nodal metastatic disease by DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI at initial staging to detection by available conventional imaging modalities (bone scan, CT, MRI) and when available biopsy pathology., Baseline and then at 2-3 months|All cause DCFPyL PET-MRI fusion or PET/MRI toxicity, To determine the safety of DCFPyL., Baseline and then at 2-3 months
The investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of using a novel small molecule PET radiotracer, DCFPyL to target prostate cancer prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA is a well studied cell surface marker of prostate cancer with increased expression associated with higher tumor grade and advanced metastatic tumors. More specifically it is associated with a higher Gleason score and there is evidence it can serve as a potential marker for prostate tumor carcinogenesis, progression and as a AR signaling surrogate marker of ADT response. This small molecule PET radiotracer specifically targeting an important prostate specific marker of AR signaling dynamics following ADT, tumor progression and metastatic potential warrants validation as an in-vivo non-invasive imaging biomarker for PSMA expression and prostate cancer detection.
