Clinical Evaluation of Opto-Acoustic Image Quality With the Gen1B Duplex Probe in Breast Applications
Comparative Evaluation of Gen1B (OA-16-1S) duplex OA/US probe versus Gen1 (OA-16-1) duplex OA/US probe in Healthy Subjects
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Gen 1B|DEVICE: Gen 1
Number of Subjects with Treatment-related Events, Safety of the Gen 1B duplex Optoacoustic (OA)/ Ultrasound (US) probe in breast applications as compared to Gen 1 with respect to treatment-related events, At end of study, average of six months|Diagnostic Image Quality of Gen 1B, Independent reader comparison using questionnaire and measurements on artifacts and features of Gen 1 Gen1B probe images for pair wise comparison, At end of study, average of six months
Probe performance data comparison across skin types, The effect of skin pigmentation using the Fitzpatrick Scale (skin typing test), from Type I (always burns, never tans (palest; freckles) to Type VI never burns (deeply pigmented dark brown to darkest brown) will be used to determine similarities and differences between probes., At end of study, average of six months|Image Quality between probes at reduced laser level, OA images with reduced laser level energy will be collected to determine via a 7 point image quality scale, where 1 is poor and 7 is best, which probe produces better images by independent readers, At end of study, average of six months
This study performs the first clinical evaluation of the Gen1B (OA-16-1S) duplex OA/US probe. This probe includes design changes to improve reliability and performance compared to the Gen1 (OA-16-1) duplex OA/US probe. The performance of the Gen1 duplex probe is functionally equivalent to the PIONEER duplex probe (OA-15-3), which was used in previous clinical studies for suspicious breast masses.
