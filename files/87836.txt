Bronchoscopy Assisted by Electromagnetic Navigation (EMN) in the Diagnosis of Small Pulmonary Nodules
Due to CT screening, a lot of peripheral nodule not accessible to conventional endoscopy will be found. Electromagnetic navigation directed bronchoscopy (ENB) is a new technique needing validation. the primary aim of the study is to compare ENB to radiologically guided bronchoscopy, considered the standard comparator.
Pulmonary Nodule Cm
PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopy
Capability of diagnosing lung nodule with ENB (Sensitivity), Calculate the sensitivity of each endoscopic technique in obtaining the diagnostic of the pulmonary nodule, After the procedure
Prediction of malignancy, To identify a predictive molecular signature able to predict the malignant nature of the nodule by studying the transcriptome (miRNAs and mRNAs) and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by using high throughput techniques in biopsies, alveolar lavage, blood and exhaled breath, After the procedure
