Combination Of Lapatinib With Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and With or Without Trastuzumab In Metastatic Breast Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to determine the optimally-tolerated regimens (OTR) for lapatinib in combination with paclitaxel, carboplatin with and without trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: lapatinib|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: trastuzumab|DRUG: paclitaxel
Adverse events and safety evaluations, * The OTR for Treatment Group A (lapatinib, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab) will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of six experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) after completing one treatment cycle.
* The OTR for Treatment Group B (lapatinib, paclitaxel, carboplatin) will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of six experiences a DLT after completing one treatment cycle.
* Adverse events and changes from baseline in laboratory values, Multiple-gated Acquisition (MUGA) scanning/Echocardiogram (ECHO), and vital signs will be evaluated to assess safety and tolerability., 28 days
Tumor response by RECIST version 1.0, Tumor response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0. RECIST has 4 response categories:

* Complete Response (CR) = disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.
* Partial Response (PR) = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
* Progressive Disease (PD) = At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline.
* Stable Disease (SD) = neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD.

A CR or PR should be confirmed within 4 weeks., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 48.5 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of PD or death due to breast cancer., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 48.5 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause. For subjects who do not progress or die, but who permanently discontinue Lapatinib treatment, progression-free survival will be censored at the time of last radiological scan preceding the initiation of alternative anti-cancer therapy. For subjects who do not progress or die and who complete the study, progression-free survival will be censored at the time of last radiological scan preceding the date of the study conclusion., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 48.5 months
