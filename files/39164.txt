Supervised Aerobic Training During or After Chemotherapy for Operable Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of aerobic exercise training during and after chemotherapy for women who have recently been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.

The participant will be instructed to self-report the session information to ExOnc staff at or before their next scheduled visit. If the participant's next scheduled visit is greater than 72 hours following an unsupervised session, ExOnc staff may reach out to the participant to retrieve the session information. Unsupervised session details will be source documented by ExOnc staff.

Change in VO2 peak (functional capacity), To determine the optimal timing of aerobic activity, relative to an attention-control group, on exercise capacity in a breast cancer setting. This will be evaluated using an electronic motorized treadmill test with 12-lead ECG monitoring (MacÂ® 5000, GE Healthcare) performed by certified exercise physiologists., during chemotherapy 3-6 months depending on treatment recommendations
Quality of Life measured by questionnaire during and after Chemotherapy, Determine the effects on patient-reported outcomes. Time frame can vary based on individual length of chemotherapy., at baseline, mid-point (12 weeks approximately) , and follow-up (24 weeks approximately) testing|Sleeping patterns as measured by questionnaire during and after Chemotherapy, Determine the effects on patient-reported outcomes.
