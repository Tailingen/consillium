Efficacity Assessment of PREVADH® in Adhesion Prevention in Gynaecologic Surgery
The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinically the efficacy of the PREVADH® Film in the prevention of adhesions in gynaecologic surgery, and to assess post-operative complications related to adhesions and pregnancy rate after myomectomy by open surgery.
Uterine Fibroids|Fertility Disorders
OTHER: Ringer lactate solution|DEVICE: Prevadh film
Number of Patients With Adhesions to Uterine Scars, The primary endpoint was the assessment of adhesions to uterine scars and comprised the incidence (expressed per patient and per uterine scar), extent, and severity of adhesions observed during the second-look laparoscopy performed 10 to 20 weeks after the myomectomy.

This assessment was made by the surgeon (investigator) on the one hand and by two independent surgeons who reviewed the video recordings on the other hand., 10 to 20 weeks post surgery
Fertility, Fertility was assessed by pregnancy and deliveries rates at 3 years., 3 years|Adnexal Adhesions, Adnexal Adhesions were assessed by AFS score. AFS (= American Fertility Society) score was developed in 1980's by the American Fertility Society in an effort to address needs for a classification scheme for adnexal adhesions suspected to be associated with infertility. 4 anatomic sites evaluated: R-tube; R-ovary; L-tube; L-ovary. Final AFS score for a patient is the score of the side with lower summed score. The higher score, representing the side with the higher adhesion burden, is dropped; Score AFS is from 0 (best possible outcome) to 32 (worse possible outcome)., 10 to 20 weeks post surgery|mAFS Abdominopelvic Adhesion Score, mAFS abdominopelvic adhesion score in 23 sites (at the anterior caudal peritoneum; parietocolic gutter right; right and left colon; right and left anterior cranial peritoneum; rectosigmoid; omentum; small intestine; anterior and posterior uterus; posterior cul-de-sac; right and left ovaries \[internal and lateral sides\], pelvic side walls, ovarian fossae, tubes, and bulbs). It ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 16 (worse possible outcome)., 10 to 20 weeks post surgery
This study was addressed to patients having an immediate or differed pregnancy desire and presenting a symptomatic or asymptomatic fibroma being able to interfere with fertility.

* The primary end point was the assessment of adhesion rate to the uterine surgical sites during a laparoscopic second look performed 10 to 20 weeks post-surgery.
* The secondary end points were the assessment, throughout a 3 years follow-up period, of:

  * pregnancy rate,
  * adverse events related to adhesions,
  * adnexal adhesions according to American Fertility Society score,
  * abdomino-pelvic adhesions according to the modified American Fertility Society score.
