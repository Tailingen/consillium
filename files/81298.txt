Efficacy of Endoscopic Band Ligation (DEBL) for Duodenal Neuroendocrine Neoplasms(dNENs)
Primary objective To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy (clinical success) of dEBL at 3 months

2b. Secondary objective

To evaluate adverse events, technical success and recurrence on follow-up

50 patients over 1-year duration based on our previous study of Prospective data (2023-2024)
Duodenal Neuroendocrine Tumor
PROCEDURE: duodenal ndoscopic bind ligation
Therapeutic efficacy (clinical success) of dEBL at 3 months and 1 year, Therapeutic efficacy (clinical success) of dEBL at 3 months and 1 year, One year
Adverse events and recurrence on follow up, Univariate and multivariate analysis will be done to determine which are the factors associated with clinical success and clinical recurrence, One year
We will collect your basic demographics details like age, Sex, date of admission, Endoscopy (is a test to look inside your body) details of Site, size, number of lesion.

By EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines two techniques - endoscopy and ultrasound - to help doctors see, evaluate and diagnose conditions in and near the gastrointestinal (GI) tract) details of layer of Duodenum involved, site/size/number of lesions.

We will collect your details of Duodenal endoscopic band ligation procedure to check feasibility, technical success.

You are requested to come for follow up for 3 months for endoscopy prodecure.
