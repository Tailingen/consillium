Effects of Myofascial Massage and Patient-therapist Communication Levels on Shoulder Muscle Properties in Breast Cancer Survivors With Myofascial Pain
The objective of the proposed study is to assess how myofascial massage alters stiffness and microvascular perfusion of shoulder muscles and how these changes are influenced by patient-therapist interactions.

The primary hypothesis is that stiffness of shoulder muscles will be decreased, and microvascular perfusion will be increased after a 30-minute myofascial massage, and that the addition of patient-therapist communication levels will result in greater changes with certain levels.
Pain, Myofacial
BEHAVIORAL: Massage
Change in muscle stiffness of the pectoralis major, This will be assessed by ultrasound shear wave elastography before and after myofascial massage., Baseline, post massage (approximately 30 minutes and 60 minutes)
Change in muscle perfusion of the pectoralis major and upper trapezius, This will be assessed by Doppler imaging and superb microvascular imaging before and after myofascial massage., Baseline, post massage (approximately 30 minutes and 60 minutes)|Change in muscle stiffness of the pectoralis major compared between groups, This will be assessed by ultrasound shear wave elastography and compared between patients randomized to a group with restricted or unrestricted communication with the massage therapist., Baseline, post massage (approximately 30 minutes and 60 minutes)|Global Satisfaction measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change will be compared between groups at the different communication levels, This is a one question that participants chose from Very much improved (0) - Very much worse (6)., Approximately 60 minutes (during wait period after massage)
