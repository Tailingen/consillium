Breast Cancer
Enrolled women will undergo bilateral DBT. Prior breast imaging data (screening and diagnostic mammography) must have been conducted on GE equipment and the images must be available (or imaging must be repeated). DBT images will be read on-site by one or more qualified radiologists. All subjects who undergo biopsy will be asked to return in approximately 1 year for a follow-up mammogram. Images will be processed and evaluated by independent readers.
