The Effect of Balance PD Solution on the Peritoneal Membrane in Patients on Automated Peritoneal Dialysis
To investigate the biocompatibility of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution balance in comparison to the conventional PD solution in APD(automated peritoneal dialysis) patients using the APD cycler sleep•safe.
Chronic Renal Failure
DRUG: Solution B (balance PD solution)|DRUG: Solution A (conventional PD solution)
CA 125 (cancer antigen 125) appearance rate in the 24 hours effluent and estimated hydration, The appearance rate is defined as the sum of the amount of CA125 determined in each outflow bag (concentration of CA125 in outflow multiplied with outflow volume) divided by the real cumulative dwell time of all dwells performed on the day of the 24-hour dialysate collection., 16 weeks
Equivalence of the investigational PD solution balance regarding fluid status compared to the conventional PD solution.

Effects of balance on inflammation and systemic advanced glycation end products formation.

Effects of balance on peritoneal and total urea clearance, on peritoneal and total creatinine clearance and on ultrafiltration, on residual diuresis and on cholesterol levels.

Safety of the investigational PD solution balance and the conventional PD solution as a control drug.

The mesothelial cell mass assessed by Cancer Antigen 125 is affected by the use of the type of PD solution in APD patients using sleep•safe. Treating patients with the PD solution balance leads to not more than 1 litre difference in hydration in comparison to the conventional PD solution which is considered as clinically not relevant regarding blood pressure.
