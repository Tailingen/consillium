Effect of a Diet and Physical Activity Intervention in Breast Cancer Survivors
This is a single-arm pre-post pilot study, to assess changes in weight, quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness after a diet and physical activity intervention in breast cancer survivors and to asses possible relation between these changes.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Weight loss intervention
Weight loss, Loss 3% of the initial weight, 3 months
Quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 mean scores, 3 months
Biomarkers, Blood analysis: Biomarkers related to glucose, lipid profile, IGF1, reproductive hormones, leptin, adiponectin, carotenoids, inflammation markers, oxidative stress markers and hematologic parameters, will be analysed, 3 months|Cardiorespiratory fitness, To determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), an incremental cycle-ergometer test with monitoring ECG will be performed by exercise physiologists after a 24h period without physical activity in the Physiology Department of the University of Barcelona, 3 months|Dietary habits, A validated food frequency questionnaire will be used, designed to capture dietary habits, 24-hour dietary recalls (covering week days and weekends) will be taken to calculate the patients' energy intake and nutritional profile., 3 months
Aim:

The present study assessed changes in weight, quality of life (QoL) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) during a diet and physical activity (PA) intervention in breast cancer (BC) survivors and investigated the possible relation between these changes.

Methods:

The intervention of this 12-week single-arm pre-post pilot study involved group-based sessions: one-hour weekly diet sessions delivered by a dietician and 75-minute bi-weekly PA sessions of moderate-to-high intensity led by PA monitors. This intervention, designed to promote weight loss, targeted overweight/obese women who had completed treatment less than six months before recruitment. CRF and QoL were assessed before and after the intervention and compared using paired t-tests. Linear regression models, including CRF variables, weight change and participants' characteristics, were used to assess the independent association between change in CRF and change in QoL.
