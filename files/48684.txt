A Study of Biomarker-Directed, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Based Combination Therapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-495/KEYNOTE-495)
This study will investigate the utility of biomarker-based triage for study participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without prior systemic therapy. Study participants within groups defined by a biomarker-based classifier (gene expression profile \[GEP\] and tumor mutational burden \[TMB\]) will be randomized to receive pembrolizumab in combination with quavonlimab (MK-1308), favezelimab (MK-4280), or lenvatinib. The primary hypotheses are as follows: In participants receiving pembrolizumab in combination with either quavonlimab, favezelimab, or lenvatinib, the Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be 1) greater than 5% among participants with low GEP and low TMB, 2) greater than 20% among participants with low GEP and high TMB, 3) greater than 20% among participants with high GEP and low TMB, and 4) greater than 45% among participants with high GEP and high TMB.
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Favezelimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Quavonlimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters \[SOD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by local site., Up to ~2 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by local site., Up to ~2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~2 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants in each treatment arm experiencing an AE will be reported., Up to ~2 years|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants in each treatment arm that discontinued study drug due to an AE will be reported., Up to ~2 years
After Amendment 5, participants can receive 800 mg of favezelimab every 3 weeks (Q3W)
