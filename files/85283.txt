The Safety and Efficacy of Redsenol-1 Plus on Cancer-related Fatigue in Adults
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Redsenol-1 Plus on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in adults. The change in the severity of CRF from baseline at week 12 will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) fatigue subscale, and compared between Redsenol-1 Plus and placebo groups. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of Redsenol-1 Plus, as compared to placebo, will be measured by the occurrence of and/or changes in treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs).
