COmbination of Radiotherapy With Anti-PD-1 Antibody for unREseCtable Biliary Tract Cancer
The study is a single-arm, phase II trial. The purpose is to investigate both the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in unresectable biliary tract cancer patients.

Progression-free survival, PFS, defined as the time from the commencement of radiotherapy until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever happens first. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment. Patients not having an event will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment. If patients don't have baseline tumor assessments, they will be censored at the date of the first treatment., one years
Overall survival, OS, defined as the time from the commencement of radiotherapy until death from any cause. Patients who withdraw or are lost to follow-up or still alive will be at the date last known to be alive., one years|Adverse events, AE, adverse events during the treatment period using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0)., one years|Objective response rate, ORR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1., one years|Disease control rate, DCR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1., one years
The trial will recruit 36 patients, and they will undergo radiotherapy plus anti-PD-1 antibody. Patients will receive conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy first for a total dose more than 45Gy. Camrelizumab 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks will be initiated within 7 days after radiotherapy.
