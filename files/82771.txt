Radiation-induced Toxicity in Prostate Cancer/ Standard-Follow-Up Program Prostate
The goal is to gain insight in the development and course of the toxicity after a curative treatment of prostate cancer

All with curative intent treated prostate cancer patients will be enrolled in the SFP (Standard Follow-up Programme). It also includes the post -operative adjuvant treatments and the patients with positive lymph nodes.

Patients will complete weekly questionnaires to score the patient -rated toxicity. Biweekly patients are seen by the treating radiation oncologist and / or AIOS in which the physician -rated toxicity is scored. In the follow-up will always patient -rated toxicity and physician -rated toxicity can be determined.

Use of an SFP should yield a profit for the practitioner , such as the automatic generation of letters. This should apply to all SFPs .

Quality of life and toxicity in patients will be completed on the touch-screen computers at FU visits.
