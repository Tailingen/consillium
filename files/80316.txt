Feasibility of the Combination of Chemotherapy (Carbo/Caelyx or Carbo/Doxorubicin) With Tocilizumab (mAb IL-6R) and Peg-Intron in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this interventional study is to determine the feasibility to combine standard chemotherapy (Carbo/Caelyx or doxorubicin) for recurrent ovarian cancer with immunotherapy (Tocilizumab and Peg-Intron).

This study combines standard chemotherapy Carboplatin-Caelyx or doxorubicin with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6R (tocilizumab). High IL-6 levels correlate with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer patients. In cases of chemoresistant ovarian cancer, therefore, modulation of the IL-6 pathway, by blocking the IL-6 receptor, may represent a promising strategy to both abolish drug resistance and amplify host immunity in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R pathway may enhance immunogenic cell death and restore local normal DC maturation. In addition, the use of interferon-alpha (Peg-Intron) allows the full maturation of DC, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: tocilizumab and interferon alpha 2-b|DRUG: Carboplatin and Caelyx or doxorubicin
The feasibility (NCI-CTCv4.0) to combine carboplatin and PLD or doxorubicin with tocilizumab as well as with tocilizumab and Peg-Intron, The safety (NCI-CTCv4.0)and efficacy (immune-monitoring)of the new combination will be measured ., two years
The effect of chemo-immunotherapy on the immune system, Study the effect of chemo-immunotherapy on the immune system by assessing changes in plasma signature (eg IL6, IL8, VEGF, CRP) dendritic cell phenotype and T- and B-cell responses to known tumor antigens in ovarian cancer (eg NY-ESO, p53), antibodies to antigens associated with immunogenic cell death (CRT, HMGB1) and in tumor tissue by gene array, two years|The relation between anti-tumor immunity and clinical outcome, Study the relation between anti-tumor immunity and clinical outcome (response (RECIST 1.1), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS)), two years
