Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Targeted Therapy Fatigue (CBT-TTF) Intervention
The purpose of this study is to evaluate Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Targeted Therapy Fatigue (CBT-TTF) with fatigued chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy relative to usual care only in a small-scale randomized controlled trial.

Self-reported Fatigue Scores - Change From Baseline Per Scoring Category, Baseline versus follow-up fatigue will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) v.4, a 13-item self-report measure yielding total score with demonstrated reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and an identified Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MID). The fatigue subscale consists of 13 items asking about fatigue in the past 7 days. Items are summed to produce a score ranging from 0-52 with lower scores indicating greater fatigue. A difference of 3 points on the fatigue subscale indicates a clinically-important difference., Baseline and at 18 weeks
Self-reported Quality of Life (QoL) Scores - Change From Baseline Per Scoring Category, Baseline versus follow-up quality of life will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G) v.4, a 27-item measure yielding total score and scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life., Baseline and at 18 weeks
