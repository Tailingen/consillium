A Study to Assess the Effects of Multiple Study Drug Regimens in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
A study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker profiles of multiple study drugs as monotherapy in subjects with newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are candidates for surgical resection.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: ABBV-181|DRUG: ABBV-368|DRUG: ABBV-927|DRUG: ABBV-927
Changes in Gene Expression, The primary biomarker endpoint is to assess immune activation gene changes in the tumor microenvironment associated with T cell infiltration and activation, comparing baseline biopsy to surgical resection following drug treatment., Baseline (before initiation of drug treatment) and after surgical resection (up to 120 days after study drug administration)
Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Study Drug, Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of study drug, Up to approximately 120 days|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Study Drug, Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of study drug, Up to approximately 120 days|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve of Study Drug in Plasma, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of study drug in plasma, Up to approximately 120 days
