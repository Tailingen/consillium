Safety and Efficiency of IRE Plus γδ T Cell Against Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
In this study, effects of γδT cells on human Pancreatic Cancer in combination with tumor reducing surgery, for example IRE going to be investigated.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: IRE surgery|BIOLOGICAL: IRE plus γδ T cells
PFS, PFS was defined as the interval between treatment initiation and local relapse, 2 years|OS, OS was calculated as the interval from treatment initiation to death., 2 year
Tumor size, The tumor responses of the enrolled patients were assessed by CT in accordance with RECIST v1.1.Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0)., 3 months|CTC, The absolute number of CD45-CK+ CD326+ cells was used to quantitate the CTC levels., 3 months|CA 19-9, The serum concentrations of CA19-9 were evaluated by a chemiluminescent immunoassay before treatment and 90 days after treatment., 3 months
Pancreatic tumor will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as IRE. PBMC of the healthy donor will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.
