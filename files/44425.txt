Brain Metabolism in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether higher insulin resistance in young women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with reduced cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu). Brain volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative cerebral glucose uptake using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) were obtained.
Insulin Resistance
Global Brain Glucose PET Uptake, Global brain glucose uptake was quantified using FDG with dynamic positron emission tomography., Single point in time (day 1)|Brain MR Volumes, T1-weighted brain MR images were obtained on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Regional volumes were determined using FreeSurfer Suite 5.0 software., Single point in time (day 2)|Insulin Resistance (HOMA2-IR), The homeostasis model assessment computational method was used to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) from fasting plasma glucose and insulin. The HOMA2-IR is the reciprocal of insulin sensitivity (%S), as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adult). A higher score indicates a lower insulin sensitivity., Single point in time (day 1 during the FDG PET)
MRI and FDG PET scan for each participant were obtained within an average time frame of 3 weeks. Isulin resistance were assessed with the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR).
