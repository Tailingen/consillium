ALateral Flow Assay to Detect QSOX1 Peptide in Patients With or at Risk for Pancreatic Cancer
Researchers have developed a new test to measure a protein QSOX1 that is found to be elevated in subjects with pancreas cancer. Researchers are looking to use this test to compare subjects with pancreas cancer and subjects without pancreas cancer to see if this test could be used to diagnosis pancreas cancer.
