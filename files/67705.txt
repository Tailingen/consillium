Phase III Study of SAR302503 in Intermediate-2 and High Risk Patients With Myelofibrosis
Primary Objective:

* To evaluate the efficacy of daily oral doses of 400 mg or 500 mg of SAR302503 (Investigational Medicinal Product, IMP) compared to placebo in the reduction of spleen volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or computed tomography scan in patients with contraindications for MRI).

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the effect on Myelofibrosis (MF)-associated symptoms (key MF symptoms) as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary.
* To evaluate the Overall Survival of patients treated with either 400 mg/day or 500 mg/day of IMP as compared to placebo.
* To evaluate the Progression Free Survival of patients treated with either 400 mg/day or 500 mg/day of IMP as compared to placebo.
* To evaluate the durability of splenic response.
* To evaluate the safety of IMP.

DRUG: SAR302503|DRUG: Placebo
Response Rate (RR), defined as the proportion of patients who have a ≥35% reduction in volume of spleen size at the end of Cycle 6, and confirmed 4 weeks thereafter, 6 months
Symptom Response Rate (SRR): Proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline to the end of Cycle 6 in the total symptom score., This assessment will be conducted through the modified MFSAF diary, which will be completed during the week prior to Day 1 of each treatment cycle up to Cycle 6, and during the week prior to the end of Cycle 6., 6 months|OS (overall survival) of either 400 mg/day or 500 mg/day of IMP as compared to placebo., approximately 5 years|PFS (progression free survival) of either 400 mg/day or 500 mg/day of IMP as compared to placebo., approximately 5 years|Proportion of patients who have ≥25% reduction in volume of spleen size at end of Cycle 6, and confirmed 4 weeks thereafter., 6 months|Duration of spleen response, measured by MRI (or CT scan in patients with contraindications for MRI., 2 years|Clinical and laboratory events graded by the NCI CTCAE v4.03., approximately 5 years
The expected duration of a patient's treatment in this study is approximately 8 months, based on a maximum 28-day screening period, followed by a ≥6-month (6-cycle) treatment period, and an End Of Treatment (EOT) visit, which should be performed at least 30 days following the last administration of IMP or placebo.

Patients who continue to benefit clinically will be allowed to remain on IMP or placebo beyond the 6-month treatment period until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
