A Study to Evaluate TROP2 ADC LCB84 Single Agent and in Combination With an Anti-PD-1 Ab in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate LCB84, a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, alone and in combination with an anti-PD-1 Ab, in dose escalation (Phase 1) followed by dose expansion (Phase 2).

The study population in dose escalation (Phase 1) consists of patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard of care, or for whom no standard of care exists. After the MTD and/or RP2D for single agent LCB84 is determined, dose escalation cohorts with select tumor types will be enrolled. Combination LCB84 and anti-PD-1 Ab will be evaluated in dose escalation after a minimum of 2 dose levels of single agent LCB84 have established DLT safety, to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of combination LCB84 and anti-PD-1 Ab, and to continue into dose expansion cohorts in select tumor types.
