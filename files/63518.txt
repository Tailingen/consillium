This study aims to include 60 HER-2 negative advanced gastric cancer patients who received first-line treatment with tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in our hospital from November 1, 2020 to November 1, 2021. Clinicopathological data, blood tests and imaging data of the patients were collected. The primary endpoints evaluated were PFS and OS, and the secondary endpoints were ORR and safety. At the same time, ctDNA and peripheral cytokine status of patients as well as second-generation sequencing of tumor tissues at baseline were collected for the exploration of therapeutic efficacy related biomarkers.
