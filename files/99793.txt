Evaluation of MGN1703 Maintenance Treatment in Patients With mCRC With Tumor Reduction During Induction Treatment
The purpose of this this trial is to prove the efficacy and safety of MGN1703 as a maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapeutic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: Usual Maintenance|DRUG: MGN1703 treatment
Overall survival, Overall survival after randomization, 36 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS1: from randomization until first PD PFS2: from start of re-introduction therapy until second PD PFS3: from start of first-line Treatment until second PD, 36 months|Safety, AEs, vital signs, ECGs, safety labs as required, 36 months|Overall Response rate, Complete and partial responses according RECIST 1.1 after randomization, 36 months|Quality of life (QoL), QoL according EORTC questionnaires, 36 months
Due to the toxicity of chemotherapeutic medications treatment breaks are common practice in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. During these treatment breaks a variety of maintenance treatments are available.

MGN1703 is developed not only to help the Patient to recover from chemotherapy but also to boost the patient's immune System and thus help him to effectively fight the Tumor himself.

After the concept has already been proved in a previous study this Trial is conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGN1703 Treatment.
