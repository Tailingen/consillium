Real World Insights During Treatment for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma with Isatuximab
This descriptive study aims to evaluate the experience of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc through collection of quantitative, qualitative and wearable data. Fifty adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc will be enrolled across 2 sites, The University of California San Francisco and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Consented participants will be enrolled in a 3-month digital health coaching program through which electronic patient reported outcomes and wearable activity data will be collected. Outcomes include treatment experience, quality of life, financial toxicity, treatment adherence, symptom burden and health self-efficacy. These will be captured by patient reported outcome measures including the Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment- Real World (PQAT-RW), Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGIC/S), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma (QLQ-MY20), and the European QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Form (CBI-B), Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Medication Adherence Index, Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) Instrument.

Clinical data, including treatment history, healthcare utilization, and co-morbidities, as well as demographic data will be collected via the electronic health record from each clinical site. This data will be complemented by qualitative data from a selected cohort of study participants with a focus on treatment experience ranging from infusion burden, toxicity management, to overall quality of life. Evaluation of this data in combination will be used to better understand the treatment experience of individuals on standard of care isatuximab-irfc specifically, and with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma generally, contributing to an existing gap in the literature regarding patient reported outcomes from diverse data sources. Outcomes will be analyzed with attention to the relationship between social determinants of health, including race, ethnicity, and geographic location, and treatment experience as reflected in both the qualitative and quantitative data.

Change in Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment Real World version (PQAT-RW), A 6-item survey assessing experience of a drug during clinical trial. The instrument consists of 3-free text and 3 scaled responses assessing the perceived benefits and disadvantages of received treatment and willingness to continue on drug after the study., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Qualitative Interview, A one time interview will be conducted to learn more about the experience of individuals related to their diagnosis, treatment, symptoms, side effects and overall care experience., Within the last month of study participation
Change in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), A 30-item measure of quality of life across 5 domains, including physical, emotional, social, role and cognitive), 8 symptoms, and items assessing global health and financial toxicity. Recall over the past week is scored primarily on a 4-point scale ranging from "not at all" to "very much". The instrument may be administered either on paper or electronically., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma (QLQ-MY20), A 20-item measure of quality of life among individuals with multiple myeloma. It assesses a series of symptoms on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at All) to 4 (Very Much)., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in European QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), A measure of quality of life across 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Form (CBI-B), This 12-item instrument measures self-efficacy in coping with cancer across 7 domains. These include: Seeking and Understanding Medical Information, Emotion Regulation, Coping with Treatment Related Side Effects, Accepting Cancer/ Maintaining a Positive Attitude, Seeking Social Support, and Using Spiritual Coping. The instrument utilizes a 9-point response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all confident" to 9 "Confident"., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) Scale, A 1-item measure of severity of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma symptoms since the last visit, which is scored a on a 5-response scale ranging from "none" to "very severe"., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale, A 1-item measure of patient perception of change in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma symptoms since starting a study. Responses are scored on a 7-point scale, ranging from "very much worse" to "very much better"., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Medication Adherence Index, The Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) is a three-item questionnaire used to measure antiretroviral therapy adherence. This questionnaire was developed through the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) initiative called Assessing Existing Efforts to Increase Adherence to Medication. Patients take less than 5 minutes to answer the three unique questions, asking about their difficulty taking medications on time, average days per week with one dose missed, and the last time they missed a dose., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months|Change in Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) Instrument, The Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) is an 11-item instrument used to measure the financial toxicity of cancer treatment, which has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with HRQoL (de Souza et al., 2017). This instrument was validated among individuals with advanced cancer and demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's Î± \>.90) and highly correlated to HRQol (p=.05). The instrument consists of 11 items, utilizing a five-point ordinal scale ranging from (0- Not at all) to (4- Very much)., Change in baseline perception of treatment experience at 3 months
