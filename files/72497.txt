Oral Vinorelbine as Induction Chemotherapy Followed Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy
Patients (pts) with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC received NVBiv 25 mg/m² + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 and NVBo 60 mg/m² on D8 every 3 weeks (q3w) for 2 cycles as induction. Pts with response or non change received NVBo 20 mg fixed dose on D1 D3 D5 + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 q3w for 2 more cycles during RT(66 Gy/6.5 w).

- duration of response (DR), Secondary endpoints were duration of response (DR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The safety analysis reported the worst grade of the adverse events (NCI CTC v. 2.0) for the safety population., up to 3 years
- progression-free survival (PFS), up to 3 years|- overall survival (OS),, up to 3 years|- safety, up to 3 years
Vinorelbine (NVB) + CDDP is considered a standard trt in induction or concomitantly with RT (Vokes, Fournel, Krzakowski). NVBo simplifies the administration of trt and provides the same efficacy as intravenous NVB (NVBiv). In order to assess this and to improve the tolerance, a trial was started with NVBiv and NVBo + CDDP as induction followed by a fractionated administration of NVBo + CDDP during RT.
