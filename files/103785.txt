Plasma-free Replacement in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
To evaluate whether the technique of no plasma exchange is suitable for the treatment, clinical efficacy, safety, and suitability of multiple myeloma patients with M protein abnormality or renal failure.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological tumor after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The tumor cells originate from plasma cells in the blood pulp and are classified as plasma cells blood myeloma plasmacytomas by the WHO Tumor. It is characterized by abnormal proliferation of blood medullary plasma cells, accompanied by monoclonal immunoglobulin or light chain. Few patients are classified as non-secretory MM that does not secrete M protein. Multiple myeloma is often accompanied by multiple hemolytic damages, hypercalcemia, anemia, kidney damage, and a serious threat to the patients' lives, health, and quality of life, which have brought a heavy burden to society. Large amounts of M protein pass through the kidneys. At times, it causes acute or chronic renal failure; M protein interferes with the activity of coagulation factors, blocking platelet function, inducing bleeding; and a large amount of M protein can also lead to hyperviscosity syndrome, increase circulatory resistance, and small blood vessel thrombosis Plug, cause various neurological diseases such as blindness, and further aggravate the progression of kidney injury. Patients with hematological myeloma nephropathy already existed at the time of diagnosis, severe patients may die due to renal insufficiency, so the patient was removed immunity globulin in the body to improve the signs of hyperviscosity and clinical symptoms is the focus of clinical research.

In this study, on the basis of previous studies, albumin-free plasma exchange fluid treatment was given to analyze the effects of clinical symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood routine, albumin, renal function, calcium content, and immunoglobulin.
