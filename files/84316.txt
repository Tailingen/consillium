6 independent, multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase II trials, based on 2-stage Simon's optimal design, will be conducted in parallel to assess the efficacy of atezolimab + BDB001+ radiotherapy, separately, in distinct populations of solid tumors:

* Population 1: pancreatic cancer
* Population 2: virus-associated tumors
* Population 3: anti-PD-1/L1 refractory non-small lung cancer
* Population 4: soft-tissue sarcoma
* Population 5: anti-PD-1/L1 refractory bladder cancer
* Population 6: triple negative breast cancer
