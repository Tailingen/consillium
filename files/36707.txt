Probiotic LGG for Prevention of Side Effects in Patients Undergoing Chemoradiation for Gastrointestinal Cancer
Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial to determine efficacy of the probiotic LGG for reducing acute treatment related GI toxicity in patients with GI malignancy with phase 1 safety lead-in.
Gastrointestinal Neoplasms
DRUG: LGG|DRUG: Placebo
Efficacy (randomized phase II trial), Compare the proportion of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine being treated with the probiotic LGG who develop CTCAE grade 2 or greater diarrhea to the proportion of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine being treated with placebo who develop CTCAE grade 2 or greater diarrhea, Up to 6 months following the last dose of LGG or placebo|Safety (phase I safety lead-in), Determine the safety and tolerability of LGG in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine

The DSMC will review the data as part of an interim analysis when the last patient has had 30 days of follow-up. The DSMC will ensure that at least 18 patients have had follow-up at 30 days (with expected 10% drop-out). Accrual to the randomized portion of the trial will occur only if there are no episodes of lactobacillus associated septicemia. Additionally, if two or more serious adverse events of a similar nature occur and a causal relationship to the investigational product cannot be excluded, accrual to the randomized portion will not occur., Up to 30 days following completion of treatment
Diarrhea subscale score, The average AUC of the FACIT-D diarrhea subscale scores will be compared between the two treatment groups using a two-sample t-test.

The FACIT-D will be completed at baseline, weekly during radiation treatment, for the two weeks following completion of radiation treatment, 12 months following the end of radiation treatment, and years 2-5 following the completion of radiation treatment., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment.|Need for antidiarrhea medication, Need for use of an antidiarrheal medication (Loperamide) will be evaluated at a binary endpoint (Use or No Use). Comparison will be made using Fisher's exact test as previously described (Chitapanarux 2010), Up to 2 weeks after completion of treatment|Grade 3 or greater diarrhea, In patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine, compare the proportion of patients who develop diarrhea of grade 3 or greater (by CTCAE version 4.0) in those treated with the probiotic LGG to the proportion in those receiving placebo, Up to 6 months following the last dose of LGG or placebo|Fecal calprotectin, Determine whether fecal calprotectin correlates with onset, duration, and/or severity of diarrhea during chemoradiation, Up to 2 weeks following the completion of treatment|Serum citrulline, Determine whether serum citrulline correlates with onset, duration, and/or severity of diarrhea during chemoradiation, Up to 2 weeks following the completion of treatment
Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial to determine efficacy of the probiotic LGG for reducing acute treatment related GI toxicity in patients with GI malignancy with phase 1 safety lead-in.
