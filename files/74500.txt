A Phase II Clinical Study of Fruquintinib Combined With RC48 in the Treatment of Previously Treated HER2-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (G/GEJ) Cancer
Although Pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy is the standard of care for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer,there is no established therapy in the second-line setting.

RC48 showed promising activity with manageable safety in patients with HER2-overexpressing, advanced G/GEJ cancer who have previously received at least two lines of chemotherapy.Fruquintinib in combination with Paclitaxel demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical antitumor activity in patients with advanced GC in ph1b/2 study.

This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in combination with RC48 in the treatment of previously treated HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib + RC48
Progression free survival (PFS), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks, until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year
Overall survival (OS), every two months follow up after EOT observation period at 30 days after the last medication, from randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Safety and tolerance evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.03, from first dose to 30 days post the last dose
This study is a phase II, single arm study with main purpose to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Fruquintinib in combination with RC48 in the treatment of previously treated HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer.

All eligible patients received Fruquintinib (4mg orally, once daily for 3 wks on/1 wk off) combined with of RC48( 2.5mg/kg by intravenous infusion during 30-90 min every 2 weeks) until investigator assessed loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, investigator or participant decision to withdraw from therapy, or death (whichever occurs first).
