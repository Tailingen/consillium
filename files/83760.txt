Rectal Surgery Evaluation Trial (RESET)
Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard of care for rectal cancer, which can be combined with low anterior resection (LAR) in patients with mid-to-low rectal cancer. The narrow pelvic space and difficulties in obtaining adequate exposure make surgeries technically challenging. Four techniques are used to perform the surgery: open laparotomy, laparoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, and transanal surgery. Comparative data for these techniques is required to provide clinical data on the surgical management of rectal cancers by surgery.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: TME with LAR
Efficacy of surgical method (success determined by composite of Oncologic, morbidity and functional outcomes), CRM, TME grade III, The absence of clavien dindo grade III-IV complications within 30 days post op, up to 4 years
The Rectal Surgery Evaluation Trial will be a prospective, observational, case-matched, four-cohort, multicenter trial designed to study TME with LAR using open laparotomy, laparoscopy, robot-assisted surgery, or transanal surgery in high-surgical-risk patients with mid-to-low, non-metastatic rectal cancer. All surgeries will be performed by surgeons experienced in a technique. Oncologic, morbidity and functional outcomes will be assessed in a composite primary outcome, with success defined as circumferential resection margin â‰¥1 mm, TME grade III, and minimal postoperative morbidity (absence of Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV complications within 30 days after surgery). Secondary endpoints will include the co-primary endpoints over the long-term (2 years), quality of surgery, quality of life, length of hospital stay, operative time, and rate of unplanned conversions.
