Circulating Tumor DNA for the Early Detection of HPV-positive Pelvic Cancer Relapses
ctDNA detection in patients with previously treated, HPV-induced, stage II or III invasive pelvic cancer and who are currently in post-treatment follow-up.
HPV Positive Pelvic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood sampling
Sensitivity of plasma circulating tumor DNA detection as a test to detect any (local or distant) relapse in patients who have been curatively treated for HPV-induced invasive pelvic cancer (cervix, anal canal, vagina, vulva, penis)., Sensitivity= % of patients with number of copies/ml of ctDNA \> threshold among those who experience a relapse within 6 months (+14 days) after the blood draw., up to 36 months|Specificity of plasma circulating tumor DNA detection as a test to detect any (local or distant) relapse in patients who have been curatively treated for HPV-induced invasive pelvic cancer (cervix, anal canal, vagina, vulva, penis)., Specificity= % of patients with number of copies/ml of ctDNA \< threshold among those who don't experience a relapse within the 6 months after the blood draw (+14 days), up to 36 months
Positive predictive values of ctDNA., Positive Predictive Value= Probability of being diagnosed with a relapse within 6 months (+14 days) after positive testing (number of copies of ctDNA in the plasma \> threshold)., up to 36 months|Negative predictive values of ctDNA., Negative Predictive Value= Probability of being relapse-free during the 6 months (+14 days) after negative testing (number of copies of ctDNA in the plasma \< threshold)., up to 36 months
Patients with previously treated, HPV-induced, stage II or III invasive pelvic cancer and who are currently in post-treatment follow-up will be included.

These patients will be followed up during 30 months (2.5 years) (if no relapse occurred before) with ctDNA detection performed at each hospital visit. At each visit, clinical, biological (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) serum marker will be done systematically) and radiological/pathology (if any) results will be prospectively collected in the study.

For the patients who have a relapse or new HPV-induced invasive cancer before 30 months, the follow-up will be discontinued at the date of the relapse.

For the patients who will have completed their follow-up for the study (2.5 years) with no relapse or new HPV-induced invasive cancer, they will be followed up for 6 months (+ 14 days), to collect any late relapse (if any). None specific study procedure will be performed during this period.
