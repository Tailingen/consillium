SWOG-9023, DNA Analysis of Tumor Tissue From Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: DNA analysis of tumor tissue may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is analyzing the DNA in tumor tissue from patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
Kidney Cancer
GENETIC: DNA ploidy analysis|GENETIC: DNA stability analysis|GENETIC: chromosomal translocation analysis|GENETIC: cytogenetic analysis|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Number of successes per number of evaluable samples, Success is defined as obtaining at least 10 analyzable metaphases., up to 4 years after registration|Number of abnormalities per number of successes, Abnormality is defined as at lease one clonal chromosomal abnormality., up to 4 years after registration|Correlation of tumor response to treatment with the type and number of abnormalities, Abnormality is defined as at lease one clonal chromosomal abnormality., up to 4 years after registration|Correlation of time from diagnosis to development of metastatic disease with the type and number of abnormalities, Abnormality is defined as at lease one clonal chromosomal abnormality., up to 4 years after registration|Correlation of time from first diagnosis of metastatic disease until death with the type and number of abnormalities, Abnormality is defined as at lease one clonal chromosomal abnormality., up to 4 years after registration
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine if cytogenetic abnormalities can predict clinical outcome, in terms of response to treatment and survival, in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma registered to the nephrectomy arm (arm I) of SWOG-8949.
* Correlate cytogenetic abnormalities and DNA content analysis (DNA index and S-phase fraction) with clinical outcome.

OUTLINE: This is a partially prospective, partially retrospective, multicenter, companion study.

Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens from patients enrolled in SWOG-8949 are evaluated by cytogenetic analysis (e.g., presence of trisomy and loss of Y chromosome) and flow cytometric analysis (e.g., presence of nondiploid cells and presence of abnormal proliferation index).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
