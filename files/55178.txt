Measuring Taste Perception During Chemotherapy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Alteration in the sense of taste is a frequent symptom that is closely linked to chemotherapy exposure, lowering quality of life and nutritional status. Malnutrition is of particular concern in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), as malnutrition is associated with many negative outcomes from radical cystectomy (the surgical procedure in MIBC), which include higher morbidity, poor wound healing, and higher rate of infections after surgery.

It is essential to understand taste changes among participants receiving chemotherapy for MIBC to create future treatment trials.
Bladder Cancer
Perceived strength of taste for the bitter and sweet tastes, Taste solution testing using Spectrum(TM) Descriptive Analysis Method. Taste perception is measured on an ordinal scale (e.g. Moderate, Strong, Very Strong)., From baseline (0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy) until day of surgery (prior to participant undergoing surgery)
Changes in nutrition status, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).The PG-SGA Short Form consist of four questions for the participant to rate their weight, food intake, any symptoms they are experiencing and their activity level, with each answer having a numerical correspondence. That score will be combined with the providers health assessment of weight loss, other health conditions that could affect nutrition, any present symptoms and physical exam; again each evaluation will be given a numeric value. The combined scores will determine the participants level of health; with A being well nourished, B being moderate/ suspected malnourished and C being severely malnourished., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery|Change in body composition, The Bodystat Quadscan 4000Â® will measure body fat, lean muscle mass and hydration by placing electrodes on the participants hands and feet. This will show either a resistance or reactance of the electrical flow to determine change in body composition, if any., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery|TAS2R38 expression in tongue and tumor/ tumor- adjacent tissues, Tongue scraping and tumor tissue will be collected and tested for TAS2R38 in the DNA, RNA and protein., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery|Differences between nutrition status at protocol scheduled visits, Wilcox signed- rank test will compare each score to determine the changes. The scores will be calculated as either positive or negative numbers. If the total score is positive this will indicate that these measurements are related to taste perception. A negative score will show they are not., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery|Difference between body composition at protocol scheduled visits, Wilcox signed- rank test will compare each score to determine the changes. The scores will be calculated as either positive or negative numbers. If the total score is positive this will indicate that these measurements are related to taste perception. A negative score will show they are not., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery|Difference between TAS2R38 expression at protocol scheduled visits., Wilcox signed- rank test will compare each score to determine the changes. The scores will be calculated as either positive or negative numbers. If the total score is positive this will indicate that these measurements are related to taste perception. A negative score will show they are not., 0-14 days prior to initial chemotherapy until (before) day of surgery
