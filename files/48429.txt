A Trial to Assess Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics of Octreotide Subcutaneous Injection in Patients With Gastroentero-pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor (GEP-NET)
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) of SYHX2008 vs Octreotide Microspheres (Sandostatin LAR@) in patients with advanced, well-differentiated GEP-NET.
Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Pancreatic Tumor
DRUG: SYHX2008 injection|DRUG: Sandostatin LAR@
Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled
Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|PFS as assessed by local Investigators, PFS as assessed by local Investigators, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Overall response rate(ORR), The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the date of the first documented response of CR or PR to the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer, according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Time to Tomor Progression(TTP), TTP is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression as per RECIST 1.1, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Control of cancer-like symptoms (diarrhea and/or flushing), Assess the total occurrences of diarrhea and/or flushing ( cancer-like symptoms): Evaluate every 8 weeks (±3 days) for the first 12 months following the initial dosage, then every 12 weeks (±7 days). This assessment is based on the total instances of diarrhea and/or flushing episodes within the 7 days preceding the assessment visit., Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Up to 1 years following the last patient enrolled
This is a Phase II, open-label randomized study to assess the PK, efficacy, and safety of SYHX2008 in adult patients with well-differentiated GEP-NET. Patients will be randomized to SYHX2008 cohort or Octreotide Microspheres cohort (Sandostatin LAR@).
