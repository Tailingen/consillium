A Study of Radiation Therapy With Pembrolizumab and Olaparib or Other Radiosensitizers in Women Who Have Triple-Negative or Hormone-Receptor Positive/Her2 Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding pembrolizumab, with or without olaparib, to standard radiation therapy is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, , and to see whether the study treatment is better than, the same as, or worse than the usual approach (radiation therapy alone).
