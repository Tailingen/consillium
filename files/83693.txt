This Phase Ib/III study evaluates the efficacy and safety of IBI351 in combination with chemotherapy. There will be five cohorts of subjects, all of whom have KRAS G12C mutation and have advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Those five cohorts (A, B,C ,D and E) are treated with IBI351, IBI351+Sintilimab,IBI351+pemetrexed+cis-platinum/carboplatin,IBI351+Cetuximab, or IBI351+pemetrexed+cis-platinum/carboplatin respectively.

IBI351 is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C.
