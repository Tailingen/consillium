JS001 Combined With Regorafenib in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China. Regorafenib is the standard multi-kinase inhibitor for refractory advanced colorectal cancer. In mice, regorafenib combined with anti-PD-1 was shown superior to regorafenib, which has not yet been verified in humans. JS001 is the Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma. This study is the first multi-center, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with regorafenib tablet in patients with MSS/MSI-L/pMMR, relapsed or metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed or can not tolerate fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic treatment. The phase I clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of regorafenib tablet in this regimen, and select an acceptable safe dose for the phase II clinical trial to further determine safety and efficacy of this combination regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China, with incidence and mortality ranking the 3rd and 4th among malignancies in China. Regorafenib is the standard multi-kinase inhibitor for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, with multiple anti-tumor effects by inhibiting targets related to tumor cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, tumor angiogenesis and tumor immune escape, howerver, its efficacy is limited. Immunotherapy has become standard treatment for mCRC patients with MSI-H/dMMR. Combination of anti-angiogenesis treatment and immunotherapy may have a better anti-tumor effect. In mice, regorafenib combined with anti-PD-1 was shown superior to regorafenib, which has not yet been verified in humans. JS001 is the Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma. This study is the first multi-center, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with regorafenib tablet in patients with MSS/MSI-L/pMMR, relapsed or metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed or can not tolerate fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic treatment.
