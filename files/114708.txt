Clinical Study of Anti-FLT3 CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of Relapsed/refractory AML
This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to determine the safety of anti-FLT3 CAR-T in subjects with R/R AML. The primary objective is to assess safety. Up to 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled. Evaluable subjects are defined as those who have received an infusion of HG-CT-1.

Primary clinical objectives:

i. Determine the safety of HG-CT-1 based on the proportion of subjects infused with HG-CT-1 who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

Secondary clinical objectives:

i. Estimate the efficacy of HG-CT-1 according to standard clinical response criteria for AML.

ii. Estimate overall survival of evaluable subjects. iii. Estimate progression-free survival of evaluable subjects. iv. Estimate duration of response in evaluable subjects who achieve a response.

Secondary scientific objectives:

i. Describe the persistence and trafficking of HG-CT-1. ii. Describe HG-CT-1 bioactivity and its predictors.
Relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML)
DRUG: Anti-FLT3 CAR-T cells
Determine the safety of HG-CT-1 cells based on the proportion of subjects infused with HG-CT-1 who experience a DLT., Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities related to HG-CT-1. First-in-human study with unknown safety of infusion of HG-CT-1., From the time of HG-CT-1 infusion until Day 28
Estimate the efficacy of HG-CT-1 cells as defined by clinical response according to established criteria for AML., Proportion of subjects with response, according to ELN 2022 criteria. {Dohner et al., 2022 #29518}. To demonstrate the anti-AML activity of HG-CT-1., Day 14, Day 28, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12|Estimate the Overall Survival (OS)., Proportion of subjects alive at 6 months and one year. To demonstrate effect on disease biology and prognosis (compared to historical expectations)., At 6 months and 1 year|Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS)., Proportion of subjects alive without progression at 6 months and one year. To demonstrate durability of anti-AML effect., At 6 months and 1 year|Estimate the Duration of response (DOR)., Proportion of subjects with response who remain alive and without progression at 6 months and at one year. To demonstrate durability of anti-AML effect., At 6 months and 1 year
