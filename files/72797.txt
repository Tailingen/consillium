A Phase II Study of Sunitinib Versus Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma with radiotherapy or surgery. But if this cancer spreads, it is more difficult to treat.

Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma that has spread with a chemotherapy called dacarbazine, but they are always looking to find new ways to treat uveal melanoma.

This study aims to find out how well Sunitinib works to treat uveal melanoma and to see how long Sunitinib and Dacarbazine can help to prevent the cancer from getting worse.
Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Sunitinib
Progression Free Survival, The primary outcome measure for this trial is the progression-free survival time measured from date of randomisation. For patients with evidence of progressive disease (as measured by CT scan, or MRI if necessary) or patients who have died from any cause, progression-free survival time will be calculated to date of progressive disease or date of death (whichever occurs first) and will be counted as events in the analysis. Patients still alive with no evidence of progression at the time of their last visit are censored at the time of the most recent information., Once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured from date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Patients still alive at the time of the analysis are censored at the date of the most recent follow-up., Analysis will take place once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of complete (CR) or partial responders (PR) as defined by the RECIST version 1.1, Analysis will take place once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months|Time to progression on first-line treatment compared to second-line treatment, Time to progression on first-line treatment compared to second-line treatment for patients who receive cross-over therapy., Analysis will take place once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months|Overall response rate on first-line treatment compared to overall response rate on second-line treatment for patients who receive cross-over therapy, Overall response rate on first-line treatment compared to overall response rate on second-line treatment for patients who receive cross-over therapy, Analysis will take place once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months|Assessment of Adverse Events, Adverse Events recorded following randomisation will be classified using NCI CTCAE version 4., Analysis will take place once all patients have been followed up for at least 3 months
124 eligible patients will be randomised to either Sunitinib or Dacarbazine treatment. Participants will then attend 3-weekly clinic visits and undergo 12-weekly tumour assessment (CT or MRI scan) until disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) has been identified.

At progression, patients may crossover to the other study treatment and continue with 3-weekly clinic visits and 12-weekly imaging until second progression.
