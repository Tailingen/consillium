Hyperthermia Combined With Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Abdominal and Pelvic Malignancies or Metastases
It is a non-randomized pilot study.The allocation will be determined by patients or their immediate family members who were cooperative with physician's interpretations on the disease progression and updated information of cutting of edge treatment, the financial affordability, availability of treatment plans, possible tolerance or risks etc.The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of autologous cellular immunotherapy combined with hyperthermia in abdominal and pelvic malignancies or metastases patients. Furthermore, to characterize response to different regimens,the investigators intent to explore the predictive and prognostic biomarker, as well as the changes in immune repertoire.
