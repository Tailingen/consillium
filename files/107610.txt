Dose Escalation (Phase 1a): Determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of JAB-23E73 monotherapy., Number and proportion of patients who experience at least 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 21 days of treatment. A DLT is defined as any toxicities that meet the criteria for a DLT assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 during the evaluation period at any dose., Up to 1 year|Dose Escalation (Phase 1a): Evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of JAB-23E73., Safety and tolerability of repeated cycles from first drug administration up to the Safety Follow Up Visit (SFUV), Up to 2 years|Dose Expansion/Optimization (Phase 1b): Determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of JAB-23E73 in patients with KRAS- alternated NSCLC or other selected tumors., RP2D determined by MTD, long term tolerability, PK, efficacy and any other relevant data as available., Up to 2 years|Indication Expansion (Phase 2a): Evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-23E73 monotherapy at the RP2D in patients with advanced or metastatic CRC, PDAC, and other solid tumors., ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with the best overall response of confirmed partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) per RECIST v1.1., Up to 3 years|Dose Expansion/Optimization (Phase 1b): Determine the RP2D of JAB-23E73 in patients with KRAS- alternated NSCLC or other selected tumors., RP2D determined by MTD, long term tolerability, PK, efficacy and any other relevant data as available., Up to 2 years|Indication Expansion (Phase 2a): Evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-23E73 monotherapy at the RP2D in patients with advanced or metastatic CRC, PDAC, and other solid tumors., ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with the best overall response of confirmed PR, or CR per RECIST v1.1., Up to 3 years
Dose Escalation (Phase 1a): Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of patients with the best overall response of confirmed partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 2 years|Dose Escalation (Phase 1a): Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of JAB-23E73, Up to 2 years|Dose Expansion/Optimization (Phase 1b): Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with the best overall response of confirmed PR, or CR per RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years|Dose Expansion/Optimization (Phase 1b): Evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of JAB-23E73., Safety assessments including but not limited to TEAEs, SAEs, deaths and changes in clinical laboratory measures., Up to 2 years|Dose Expansion/Optimization (Phase 1b): Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of JAB-23E73, Up to 2 years
Study JAB-23E73-1002 is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anticancer activity of JAB-23E73 as a single agent in adult patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS alteration. This study consists of a Phase 1a dose-escalation, followed by Phase 1b dose-expansion and Phase 2a indication expansion. After completing dose-escalation, the MTD or preliminary RP2D of JAB-23E73 will be determined. The RP2D will be determined according to the safety, efficacy and PK data from phase 1b. The indication expansion phase will further explore the efficacy and safety in advanced KRAS-alternated tumors which consist of 3 cohorts: Cohort C1, the CRC cohort; Cohort C2, the PDAC cohort; and Cohort C3, other solid tumor cohort.
