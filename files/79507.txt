Perioperative Sintilimab Plus Bevacizumab Biosimilar and TACE-HAIC for HCC Patients With PVTT: A Phase-2 Clinical Trial
Although resection provided survival benefit for selected HCC patients with PVTT, the recurrence rate is still high for those patients. It is still unknown whether perioperative Sintilimab, a PD-1antibody, plus bevacizumab biosimilar and TACE-HAIC will improve the survival for those patients. We initialed this phase 2 clinical trial to prove the perioperative therapy.
