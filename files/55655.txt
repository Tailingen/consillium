Risk Enabled Therapy After Initiating Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Bladder Cancer (RETAIN)
The aim of this study is to evaluate a risk-adapted approach to the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer. Each baseline transuretheral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) sample will be sequenced while proceeding with neoadjuvant accelerated methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (AMVAC) chemotherapy. Based on the mutational profile and the post AMVAC TURBT findings, patients will be treated with active surveillance (experimental arm), or standard of care intravesicle therapy, chemoradiation or surgery. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to non-inferior metastasis-free survival at 2 years, while preserving the bladder and thus quality-of-life for a proportion of patients.

This phase II trial studies how well maximal transurethral surgery (surgery performed with a special instrument inserted through the urethra) followed by accelerated methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, and radiation therapy work in treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread to the muscle. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cisplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
