A Study Comparing Abelacimab to Dalteparin in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Cancer and Associated VTE
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, blinded endpoint study to evaluate the effect of abelacimab relative to dalteparin on venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) cancer associated VTE (Magnolia)
Venous Thromboembolism|Deep Venous Thrombosis|Pulmonary Embolism
BIOLOGICAL: Abelacimab|DRUG: Dalteparin
Time to first event of centrally adjudicated VTE recurrence consisting of new proximal deep venous thrombosis, new pulmonary embolism (PE) or fatal PE, including unexplained death for which PE cannot be ruled out, 6 months
Time to first event of ISTH-adjudicated major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding events, 6 months|Net clinical benefit defined as survival without VTE recurrence, or major or CRNM bleeding, 6 months
Cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) is a severe medical condition which is characterized by high incidence of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and high risk for bleeding. Patients with intact GI and GU cancer have increased bleeding risk with oral direct anticoagulants (DOACs), Guidelines advice caution with those DOACs or state preference for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in this population. The ANT-008 study will compare treatment with abelacimab monthly administration to LMWH daily subcutaneous (sc) administration over 6-month treatment. The study outcomes include VTE recurrence, bleeding event and treatment discontinuation at 6 months
