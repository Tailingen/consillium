Prostate Screening Study Using MRI in BRCA Carriers
Men with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at increased risk for early onset, aggressive prostate cancer compared to men in the general population.

Standard of care screening for men with a BRCA mutation includes PSA testing and digital rectal examination (DRE), the same as with men in the general population.

This study is being done to assess whether there is value in using MRI as a screening tool to detect prostate cancer at an earlier stage than may otherwise be detected using standard of care screening (PSA, DRE). It is unclear whether MRI has utility as a screening tool in this specific population at high risk for aggressive disease.

To determine the value of using Multispectral 3T MRI (MS3TMRI) for prostate cancer screening in men with a high risk of developing early onset aggressive prostate cancer given known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status, with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis, independent of baseline PSA levels.

* Determine the prevalence of prostate cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers independent of baseline PSA levels.
* To evaluate the accuracy of tumor targeting based on MRI and ultrasound (US) tumor co-localization. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of an automated computer aided diagnosis method (CAD) applied to MS3TMRI in the prediction of zonal biopsy results for the presence or absence of a significant cancer.
