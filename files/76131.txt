Oral-ATO for TP53-mutated Myeloid Malignancies
This is an open-label, phase 2 study of oral arsenic trioxide (Arsenol ®) in combination with ascorbic acid and investigator choice of low-intensity therapy in patients with previously untreated or relapse/refractory TP53-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

DRUG: Oral arsenic trioxide
Adverse events, Enumeration and description of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and other AEs, 24 months
Response rates, Proportion of patients who achieve a response by European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria (for AML) and International Working Group (IWG) criteria (for MDS and CMML), 24 months|Rates of molecular responses, Changes in mutant allele frequencies of TP53 mutations and other co-mutations during treatment, 24 months
Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled prospectively. Approximately 15 patients will be previously untreated and 15 patients will be relapsed or refractory to 1 or more lines of therapy.

Oral arsenic trioxide (oral-ATO) (Arsenol ®) will be used in combination with ascorbic acid, and investigator choice of low-intensity therapy that comprised hypomethylating agent (HMA) with or without venetoclax. The choice of hypomethylating agents include subcutaneous (s.c.) / intravenous (i.v.) azacitidine, i.v. decitabine or oral-decitabine-cedazuridine. Patients will be treated in 28-day days cycles.

Pending study team review of the tolerability, hematologic response, and molecular response to the combination, a future randomized Phase 2 efficacy study may be planned.
