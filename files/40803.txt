Cabozantinib With Ifosfamide in Ewing's Sarcoma and Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to better understand how safe and effective the drug cabozantinib in combination with high-dose ifosfamide is in the treatment of children and adults with relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma.
Ewing Sarcoma|Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib
Maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (MTD/RP2D) of cabozantinib, Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 (v5.0)., Upon completion of accrual to phase 1 cohort, approximately 1 year
Toxicity profile, Define and describe the toxicity profile (grade 2 and above) of cabozantinib administered in combination with high-dose ifosfamide using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Upon completion of trial, approximately 1 year|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), Define and describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of cabozantinib administered in combination with high-dose ifosfamide using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., After two cycles of treatment, average 56 days (one cycle is 28 days)|Antitumor activity Ewing sarcoma, Evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib administered in combination with high-dose ifosfamide for relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma using the Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors (RECIST) scale. Disease progression will be measured periodically while on study., 6 months|Antitumor activity osteosarcoma, Evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib administered in combination with high-dose ifosfamide for relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma using the Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors (RECIST) scale. Disease progression will be measured periodically while on study., 6 months
In this study, the investigators will test the activity of cabozantinib in combination with high-dose ifosfamide as targeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Cabozantinib has been shown to inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases, including potent inhibition of kinases, MET and VEGFR2 which are more commonly implicated in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if Cabozantinib can be used to inhibit MET and VEGFR2, or other tyrosine kinases to drive tumor responses in patients.
