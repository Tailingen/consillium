Effect of Proactive Therapeutic Drug Monitoring on Maintenance of Sustained Disease Control in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis on a Subcutaneous TNF Inhibitor: The Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapeutic DRUg Monitoring Trial (RA-DRUM)
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) versus Standard of care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with a subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (adalimumab).

The main question it aims to answer is:

Is TDM superior to standard of care in order to maintain sustained disease control without flares?

Participants will be followed with blood sampling every second month, measuring serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies of the TNFi. In the TDM-group, the researchers will adjust the dosage of the TNFi based on knowledge on optimal therapeutic ranges. In the Standard of care group, the TNFi will be administered according to standard of care without knowledge of serum drug levels or anti-drug antibodies.

Disease activity assessed by Disease Activity Score using 28 joints C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), The DAS28-CRP composite score includes the 28 tender and swollen joint counts, CRP and a Patient Global Assessment of Disease activity (PGA).

The DAS28-CRP is calculated as follows:

DAS28-CRP = 0.56\*√ (tender joints 28) + 0.28\*√ (swollen joints 28) + 0.36\*ln(CRP (mg/L)+1) + 0.014\*PGA + 0.96 High disease activity is defined as a DAS28-CRP value \> 5.1, moderate disease activity as DAS28-CRP \> 3.2 - 5.1, low disease activity as a DAS28-CRP-value of 2.6 - 3.2, and remission as DAS28-CRP \< 2.6

European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), The EQ-5D is a utility instrument for measurement of health-related quality of life.

It consists of 5 dimensions. Each dimension is scored on a level from 1 to 5:

LEVEL 1: indicating no problem LEVEL 2: indicating slight problems LEVEL 3: indicating moderate problems LEVEL 4: indicating severe problems LEVEL 5: indicating unable to/extreme

The health state is referred to by a 5-digit code, e.g. state 11111 indicates no problems on any of the five dimensions, while state 55555 indicate extreme problems on all of the five dimensions., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 months|36-Item Short-form health survey (SF-36), The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8- scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index (SF-6D). It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. Accordingly, the SF-36 has proven useful in surveys of general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of diseases, and in differentiating the health benefits produced by a wide range of different treatments., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 months|Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI:RA), The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a tool that assesses impairments in both work and daily activities. It consists of six items that determine employment status and measure absenteeism caused by health issues, presenteeism, and overall health-related impairment in both paid work and regular activities over the preceding 7 days. The questionnaire yields four outcomes: i) the percentage of work time missed due to health; ii) the percentage of impairment experienced while working due to health in the past 7 days; iii) the percentage of overall work impairment; iv) activity impairment resulting from health issues. Participants will be asked to answer the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Rheumatoid Arthritis V2.0., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 months|Rheumatoid arthritis flare questionnaire (RA-FQ), The RA-FQ was developed by the Omeract group to identify and measure flares in patients with RA.

There is a considerable variation in serum drug levels among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), and a high number develop neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAb). Sub-therapeutic drug levels and ADAb formation are major contributors to TNFi treatment failure and disease flare. Proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), i.e., individualized drug dosing based on regular assessments of serum drug levels and ADAb, has the potential to optimize the efficacy and safety of TNFi treatment.

The aim of the RA-DRUM trial is to assess whether TDM is superior to standard of care in order to maintain sustained disease control without flares in patients with RA treated with the SC TNFi adalimumab.

Participants will be randomized to:

* Administration of TNFi based on proactive TDM (TDM group)
* Administration of TNFi based on standard of care without knowledge of serum drug levels or ADAb status (Standard of care group)

Participants will be followed for 18 months with on-site visits at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 18 months and digital visits at 2, 6, 10, 14, and 16 months. Blood sampling for serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies will be done at all visits.
