Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma With Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Therapy Produced by a New Technology
The goal of this clinical trial is to to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TranspoCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-lymphoma. The main questions it aims to answer are:

This clinical trial is a Phase I/II, pilot, open-label, national, prospective, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TranspoCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-lymphoma whose prognosis is less than 2 years.

Phase I: Dose escalation phase with a classic 3+3 design, in which three dose levels of TranspoCART19 will be evaluated: 1 x 106 cells/kg, 3 x106 cells/kg and 5 x 106 cells/kg. The maximum number of patients included in this phase will be 18.

Phase II: an expansion cohort with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in Phase I.

Patients will be included in the expansion cohort up to a total of 27, including Phase I patients.
