TACE and Sorafenib for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
For patients with advanced HCC not suitable for resection or liver transplantation but without extrahepatic manifestations, local therapy with TACE is regarded as standard treatment. The present study is planned to evaluate the combination of TACE and sorafenib. A combination of TACE with a multitarget inhibitor like sorafenib may further improve the outcome of patients with HCC.
