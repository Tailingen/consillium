Lycopene in Preventing Prostate Cancer in Healthy Participants
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain substances to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The dietary supplement lycopene may prevent the development of prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lycopene in preventing prostate cancer in healthy participants.
Prostate Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: lycopene
Toxicity by blood chemistries and patient histories at 4 weeks after treatment|Pharmacokinetics by blood lycopene concentrations at 4 weeks after treatment
Define dose range by blood lycopene concentrations at 4 weeks after treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the toxicity and safety of lycopene supplementation as chemoprevention for prostate cancer in healthy participants.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this agent in these participants.
* Determine the dose range of this agent in these participants.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Participants ingest a single-dose of oral lycopene over a maximum of 15 minutes on day 1.

Cohorts of 5 participants receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 participants experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Participants are evaluated periodically for 28 days.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 participants will be accrued for this study.
