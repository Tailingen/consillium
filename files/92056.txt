Pilot Study of Optune (NovoTTF-100A) for Recurrent Atypical and Anaplastic Meningioma
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, the Optune device has on the patient and meningioma. This study is being done because currently there are no proven effective medical treatments for a progressive meningioma that has failed surgery and/or radiation. The study uses an experimental device called Optune. Optune is "experimental" because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this type of tumor, although it has been approved for a different type of brain tumor.
