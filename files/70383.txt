A Novel Molecular Approach to Blood DNA Screening for Cancer: Specificity Assessment (The NOMAD Study)
This study is being done to establish "normal' values for a new blood test and urine test approach to cancer screening. Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection on study. Patients' medical records are reviewed.

Blood level distributions of methylated DNA tumor markers, Assessed through assays performed on blood plasma across a cohort of patients without known cancer or precancer to estimate specificity cutoff ranges., Baseline|Biospecimen archive, Assessed by total number of blood samples collected. Collected blood samples will be used to facilitate assessment of clinical specificity in future molecular blood test studies or appraisal of test refinements., Up to study completion (estimate 20 years)|Detection of cancer using urine samples, Assessed by number of urine samples used to assay methylated DNA markers (MDMs), RNA, or protein in cell free or extracellular vesicles., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess blood level distributions of candidate methylated DNA tumor markers across a cohort of patients without known cancer or precancer and, thereby, to estimate specificity cutoffs across a range of percentiles.

II. To evaluate the effects on marker levels (or test specificity) of selected demographic, exposure, medication, and chronic disease covariates.

III. To build a biospecimen archive to facilitate assessment of clinical specificity in future molecular blood test studies or appraisal of test refinements.

IV. Assess feasibility for detection of cancer using urine samples to assay MDMs, RNA or protein in cell free or extra-cellular vesicles.

V. Assess feasibility for detection of cancer using saliva to assay MDMs, RNA or protein in cell free or extra-cellular vesicles.
