Neoadjuvant Therapy With Ivonescimab Combined With Chemotherapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
This study is a multicenter, single-arm, investigator-initiated Phase II clinical trial. Eligible patients with treatment-naive early or locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), clinically staged as Stage II-III, will receive neoadjuvant therapy with ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy prior to surgery. During the neoadjuvant phase, ivonescimab will be administered for a total of 12 doses. Patients who complete the neoadjuvant treatment and are deemed surgically eligible must undergo definitive surgical intervention.

Following surgery and pathological evaluation by the local pathology department at each participating center, patients will continue to receive adjuvant therapy with ivonescimab for an additional 14 doses, in addition to any subsequent treatment recommended by the investigator according to standard clinical practice.

The primary endpoint of this study is the pathological complete response rate (pCR). Participants will also be followed for secondary endpoints including event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and distant disease-free survival (DDFS), with a minimum follow-up duration of 2 years post-surgery.
TNBC, Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ivonescimab
pathological complete response rate (pCR), the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, Up to approximately 24 weeks
Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., At least 2 years|Disease-free Survival (DFS) as assessed by Investigator, DFS is defined as the time from surgery to any of the following events: local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause., At least 2 years|Distant Disease-free Survival (DDFS) as assessed by Investigator, DDFS is defined as the time from surgery to distant recurrence, or death due to any cause., At least 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR) in accordance with RECIST v1.1, Number of responders Assessed by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by MRI., Up to approximately 24 weeks|Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence rate of AEs of any cause will be evaluated in participants in the Safety Run-In according to CTCAE v5.0., up to 90 days after last dose of ivonescimab
