PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography) Investigations With BAY86-9596 (18F) (300 MBq) Following Single Intravenous Administration in Patients With Cancer or Inflammations.
The study will be conducted as an open label, single-center, single dose and biodistribution study in patients with cancer or inflammation. 56 patients will be selected among the patients undergoing the screening examination conducted within 3 weeks before drug administration. Single dose of the study drug will be administrated in a dose of 300 MBq to these patients. The follow-up period contains the end-of-study telephone interview 5-8 days following the treatment. Key measurements are the PET/CT image acquisitions within a time frame of about 2 hours after the single injection of BAY86-9596.
