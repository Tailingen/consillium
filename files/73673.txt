The Impact of Paramedic Training in Simulation on the Experience of Patients Treated for Malignant Brain Tumors in Neurosurgery (IPSIMANON)
The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that simulation training for paramedical staff in neurosurgery departments, in announcing and accompanying patients with a brain tumor, improves patient satisfaction when a (potentially malignant) brain tumor is discovered, compared with usual care.

The main question it aims to answer is:

- Are patients more satisfied (as measured by scores on the EORCT IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire) with their neurosurgical hospitalization following the discovery of a brain tumor in centers where paramedics have been trained by simulation?

Researchers will compare the results of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire to determine whether paramedic training improves patient satisfaction between simulation-trained and untrained centers.

Participants will be asked to complete the EORT IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire at the end of their hospital stay.
Brain Tumor Adult
OTHER: Paramedic training
Measuring patient satisfaction following the discovery of a brain tumor., Measurement of patient satisfaction following the discovery of a brain tumor via scores obtained, at the end of their neurosurgical hospitalization, in response to the EORCT IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire, whose dimensions of interest are ordered as follows for hierarchical analysis:

1. SATNIS = nurses interpersonal skills
2. SATNIP = nurses information provision
3. SATNAV = nurses availability
4. SATNTS = nurses technical skills,
5. SATGEN = overall quality rating, The day of discharge from neurosurgery, on average between 10 and 15 days (between 3 days and 4 weeks)
Measurement of patients' experiences following the discovery of a brain tumor via scores obtained (other questionnaire items), Measurement of patients' experiences following the discovery of a brain tumor via the scores obtained at the end of their neurosurgical hospitalization in response to the other items of the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire:

* SATEXE = exchange of information between caregivers,
* SATDIS = doctors interpersonal skills,
* SATDIP = doctors information provision,
* SATDAV = doctors availability,
* SATDTS = doctors technical skills,
* SATOTH = other personal interpersonal skills,, The day of discharge from neurosurgery, on average between 10 and 15 days (between 3 days and 4 weeks)|Measuring patients' feelings, Measuring patients' feelings with the INCA questionnaire at the end of their neurosurgical hospital hospitalization., The day of discharge from neurosurgery, on average between 10 and 15 days (between 3 days and 4 weeks)|Measuring Caregivers' Experiences/Quality of Life at Work, Measurement of caregivers' experience/quality of life at work at D0 and 6 months, using the Delmas et al. questionnaire., Day 0 and Month 6|Measurement of caregivers' listening skills., Measurement of caregivers' listening attitude, using the Porter et al. questionnaire at D0, after training and 6 months., Day 0, after training and Month 6|Measuring communication within the paramedical team, Measurement of communication within the paramedical team, using the paramedical team communication evaluation questionnaire (Likert scales) at D0 and 6 months., Day 0 and Month 6|Measuring communication between paramedical and medical teams., Measurement of communication between the paramedical and medical teams, using a questionnaire to evaluate communication between the paramedical and medical teams (Likert scales) at D0 and 6 months., Day 0 and Month 6
