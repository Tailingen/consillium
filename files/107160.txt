Efficacy and Safety of Colorectal Anastomotic Leak Testing
To evaluate the effectiveness of the gastroscopy, air, and methylene blue (GAM) leak testing in reducing the incidence of postoperative anastomotic complications, especially anastomotic leakage, in patients with colorectal cancer. The primary outcomes included is the incidence of anastomotic complications (mainly anastomotic leak) within 30 days after surgery

PROCEDURE: Intraoperative leak testing
Number of Participants with Anastomotic Leak within 30 days, Count the number of participants who develop anastomotic leak within 30 days after colorectal cancer surgery., 30 days
Number of Participants with Postoperative Complications within 30 days, Count the number of participants who develop postoperative bleeding, anastomotic stenosis, and intra-abdominal infection within 30 days after colorectal cancer surgery., 30 days
