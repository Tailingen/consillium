A Study of Panobinostat in Combination With Everolimus for Children and Young Adults With Gliomas
This phase 2 trial will evaluate the activity of Panobinostat in combination with Everolimus for children with gliomas harboring H3.1 or H3.3K27M mutation, including newly diagnosed high-grade glioma or DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma) after radiation (stratum A) and recurrent/progressive glioma (grade II-IV, including DIPG) (stratum B).
Glioma|Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
DRUG: Panobinostat|DRUG: Everolimus
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 1 Year, Median PFS at 1 year for stratum A will be measured. Progression is defined as \> 25% increase in the size of the tumor or appearance of new lesions., 1year|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 2 Years, Median PFS at 1 year for stratum A will be measured. Progression is defined as \> 25% increase in the size of the tumor or appearance of new lesions., 2years|Overall Survival at 1Year, The proportion of patients alive at 1 year for stratum A., 1year|Overall Survival at 2Years, The proportion of patients alive at 2 years for stratum A., 2years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) After Two Cycles of Panobinostat + Everolimus, Overall Response Rate (ORR) After Two Cycles of Panobinostat + Everolimus for stratum B. Overall response is defined as a partial or complete response. Partial response is defined as a â‰¥50% decrease in size of tumor in comparison to baseline measurements. Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all abnormal signal. This includes return to normal size of the brainstem for brainstem lesions., 84 Days
