Clinical Study of Antibody-Drug Conjugate MYTX-011 in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase I open label multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary effectiveness of the investigational drug MYTX-011 in patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. MYTX-011 is in a class of medications called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). MYTX-011 is composed of a pH-dependent anti-cMET antibody and the potent antimicrotubule drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).

Part 1: Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity (DLT), The dose limiting toxicities will be based on number and severity of treatment-related adverse events., Up to Day 21|Part 2: Number of patients with tumor response, The overall response rate will be based on number of complete responses and partial responses., 2 years
Part 1: Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter (Total ADC), Total ADC, 24 months|Part 1: Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter (Total antibody), Total antibody, 24 months|Part 1: Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter (Free MMAE), Free MMAE, 24 months|Part 1: ADA, Presence of anti-drug antibodies, 24 months|Part 1: ORR, Complete response + partial response, 24 months|Part 1: DOR, TTR, DCR, Duration of response in patients that achieve CR or PR, time to response, best overall response and disease control rate, 2 years|Part 1: PFS, Progression free survival, for up to 2 years after end of treatment|Part 1: OS, Overall survival, for up to 2 years after end of treatment
The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will assess the safety and tolerability of MYTX-011 and identify the dose to be studied in Part 2. Part 2 will include subjects with NSCLC with cMET overexpression or MET amplification/exon 14 skipping mutations, populations with a current unmet medical need.
