Study of IMC-1121B in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Not Responding To Standard Therapy
We are conducting a research study for tumors that have not responded to prior treatment. The subject will receive an investigational drug called IMC-1121B. ImClone LLC, the maker of IMC-1121B, is running this research study.

We believe that IMC-1121B blocks the growth factors made by the cancer cells, so new blood vessels do not grow. It is believed that without the new blood vessels, the cancer or tumor will not get the oxygen and food that it needs to grow. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die. Since normal blood vessels have already formed in adults, it might be possible to stop tumor growth without harming normal cells.

In order for a cancer to grow, it needs blood vessels to bring to it oxygen and food. Cancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. This is called angiogenesis. Normally, new blood vessels do not grow in adults. Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that may prevent abnormal growth of blood vessels to tumors. IMC-1121B is an angiogenesis inhibitor. We believe that IMC-1121B blocks the growth factors made by the cancer cells, so new blood vessels do not grow. It is believed that without the new blood vessels, the cancer or tumor will not get the oxygen and food that it needs to grow. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.
