A Study of ZD1839 Effects on Cell Proliferation in Breast Cancer
This is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects with histologically-confirmed oestrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (PgR-) primary breast cancer breast cancer will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ZD1839 250 mg once daily or matching placebo for a total period of 5 weeks. Surgical intervention will take place after 4 weeks (on Day 29) and treatment will continue for 1 week after surgery.

Estimate the effect of ZD1839 compared with placebo on the change in tumour cell proliferation in patients who have completely ER negative & PgR negative breast cancer|Aassessment of biomarker Ki-67 in breast cancer tissue at baseline by core biopsy and after 4 weeks on the surgical specimen
To assess the effect of 4 weeks of ZD1839 on the change in tumour size as assessed by ultrasounds.|To correlate the expression of tissue biomarkers (HER family and epidermal growth factor [EGF] related pathways) in the baseline biopsy sample and in the surgical (endpoint) specimen with the anti-proliferative effect of ZD1839.|To determine the effect of ZD1839 on HER-2 phosphorylation and other biomarkers in the surgical (endpoint) specimens when compared with the baseline biopsies|To assess the effect of ZD1839 on apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL in the surgical (endpoint) specimens when compared with the baseline biopsies|To determine plasma trough concentrations of ZD1839 and correlate these with molecular biomarkers detected in breast cancer tissue.
