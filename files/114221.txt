The EMPrint™ Ablate and RESect Study in Patients With Metastatic Lung Tumors (EMPRESS)
Post market prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study, designed to demonstrate dose response of an ablation system using a percutaneous approach in patients with primary, metastatic, or recurrent primary lung tumors.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Ablation|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection
Dose Response, Dose response was assessed by comparing actual ablation zone size and volume to predicted ablation zone size and volume prescribed by the physician using the Emprint™ Procedure Planning Application. Dose response was measured for each ablation zone using CT imaging immediately post ablation and prior to the surgical resection., 1 Day|Ablation Zone Shape, Ablation width (X) / height (Y), ratio of 1 indicates spherical ablation zone shape, Same day
Number of Participants With Complete or Incomplete Tumor Ablation, The secondary endpoint was complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure for each target tumor using histologic analysis. Complete ablation was defined as 100% nonviable tumor cells., Same Day
Primary Endpoint: Dose response as indicated by CT imaging, measurement of maximum diameter and volume.

Secondary Endpoint: Assessment of complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure.
