A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Venetoclax Monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL with or without the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, including those who have received prior treatment with a B-cell receptor inhibitor.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax
Complete Remission Rate in Participants Not Previously Treated With BCRi Therapy - Primary Analysis, Complete remission rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best response of complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) assessed by the investigator based on 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia National Cancer Institute-Working Group (IWCLL NCI-WG) criteria.

CR required all of the following:

* Peripheral blood lymphocytes \< 4000/μL
* Absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and computed tomography scan
* No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination
* Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms (unexplained fevers \> 38°C, drenching night sweats, \> 10% weight loss in last 6 months)
* Blood counts above the following:

  * Neutrophils \> 1500/μL
  * Platelets \> 100,000/μL
  * Hemoglobin \> 110 g/L
* Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, \< 30% lymphocytes.

CRi was defined as for CR but with persistent cytopenia apparently unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity., From first dose of study drug until the last participant completed Week 48 assessments (data cut-off date 30 June 2019); overall median time on follow-up was 23.2 months.

Questions are scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

FACT-G consists of 27 general items divided into 4 primary HRQoL domains: Physical Well-being (PWB; 7 items; score range 0-28), Social/Family Well-being (SWB; 7 items; score range 0-28), Emotional Well-being (EWB; 6 items; score range 0-24), Functional Well-being (FWB; 7 items; score range 0-28). The leukemia subscale consists of 17 items (score range 0-68) that assess patient concerns relating to leukemia. Three summary scales were calculated: FACT-Trial Outcome Index composed of the PWB, FWB, and leukemia subscale (score range 0-124); FACT-G (score range 0-108) and the FACT-Leu Total (range 0-176). Higher scores reflect better HRQoL., Baseline and Weeks 48 and 108|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue), The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire measures fatigue and its effect on functioning and daily activities. The FACIT-Fatigue includes 13 items answered on a 5-point rating scale based on a 7-day recall period. Scores range from 0 to 52, with lower scores reflecting greater fatigue., Baseline and Weeks 48 and 108|Change From Baseline in EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Health Index Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status consisting of two parts: a descriptive system consisting of 5 items and a visual analog scale (VAS).

The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The participant is asked to rate each dimension on 5 levels of severity (1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, 5: extreme problems).

The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single health utility index score representing the general health status of the individual. The health index score ranges from zero (defined as a health state equivalent to being dead) to 1 (full health)., Baseline and Weeks 48 and 108|Change From Baseline in EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status consisting of two parts, a descriptive system consisting of 5 items and a visual analog scale (VAS).

The VAS assesses the participant's self-rated overall health on a scale from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable)., Baseline and Weeks 48 and 108

MRD was evaluated using next-generation sequencing. Per protocol, peripheral blood MRD assessments were to be collected from all participants at Week 24 and Week 48 and at the time the bone marrow assessment for confirmation of CR/CRi, and bone marrow (BM) MRD assessments were to be collected for participants undergoing a bone marrow procedure for confirmation of CR/CRi.

Following the Screening period, all eligible participants initiate venetoclax on a once daily (QD) dosing schedule. To mitigate the risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), dosing will start with a 5-week dose titration phase.

Participants may receive venetoclax for up to 2 years provided they continue to tolerate the drug, have no evidence of disease progression (based on investigator assessment), do not have unacceptable toxicity and do not meet any of the criteria for subject discontinuation. In countries where venetoclax is not commercially available, participants who continued to derive benefit after 2 years of treatment may extend their treatment for up to 2 additional years in an extended access phase. Participants in the extended access phase of this study who continue to derive benefit from venetoclax after the 2-year extension and are transferring to the venetoclax extension study, Study M19-388 (NCT03844048), may remain in Extended Access for up to 1 additional year or until the extension study is approved and initiated at the site, whichever is sooner.
