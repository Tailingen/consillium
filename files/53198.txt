Cardiovascular and Torsades de Pointes Monitoring for Pazopanib
This observational study is conducted as part of a systematic pharmacovigilance activity, to provide a population-based context for Pazopanib use outside of the clinical trial setting. The aims of the study are to examine the incidence of cardiovascular ischemia (including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) and cardiac arrhythmia (Torsades de Pointes) in renal cell carcinoma patients treated with marketed anti-VEGF agents \[Pazopanib (VOTRIENT), Bevacizumab (AVASTIN), Sorafenib (NEXAVAR), and Sunitinib (SUTENT)\].

Two databases will be utilized for this study: a large healthcare claims database in the U.S. and the Dutch linked medical registries (PHARMO RLS). The databases will provide large, geographically varied, non-trial populations in which to examine the incidence of the stated cardiovascular ischemic events and Torsades des Pointes.
