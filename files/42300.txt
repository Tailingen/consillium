The occurrence of cholangitis, Cholangitis that occurred within 1 month after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP)., 1 month|Clinical success, Clinical success was defined that the decrease in the total bilirubin level to less than 50% of the pretreatment value within 1 week or to less than 75% within 1 month., 1 month
Re-intervention, Re-intervention was defined that endoscopic or percutaneous procedure to improve biliary drainage for jaundice or cholangitis after successful placement., 6 month|Adverse events, ERCP-related adverse events, 1 month
The early diagnosis of hilar bile duct stenosis is difficult, and when the patient is diagnosed, the opportunity for surgical radical resection is lost, resulting in a poor prognosis. Effective palliative treatment can significantly improve their quality of life and survival time. The method of cutting nasobiliary ducts with endoscopic scissors has many advantages. Firstly, there are multiple lateral foramen of the nasobiliary duct, which increases the drainage area. Secondly, the nasobiliary duct can be retained in the secondary bile duct, which is difficult to achieve with a conventional stent. The use of nasobiliary ducts can also reduce the difficulty of converting from external drainage to internal drainage.
