Clinical Utility of Methylation-based Prognostic Assay for Barrett's Esophagus
Capsulomics has developed a prognostic assay for patients with diagnosed Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study will measure how gastroenterologists make surveillance and treatment management decisions when presented with different clinical and prognostic assay information.

Clinical performance change in physician behavior., Change in the overall and the diagnostic and treatment in patient simulations: difference-in-differences regression analysis between the control and the intervention groups' diagnosis and treatment of risk progression in patients with Barrett's esophagus, as measured by the participants' diagnostic and treatment scores. In each category, participants' care recommendations are evaluated, ranging from 0 to a high potential score of up to 10, where higher scores mean increased intensity in surveillance and treatment, to measure the impact of the methylation assay on care decision making., 1 year|The impact of methylation assay on physician confidence in clinical care decision-making., Measure the confidence in care decisions based on patient's methylation test result: Once the intervention group is exposed to the intervention, education materials on the methylation assay (a validated molecular test for risk stratifying patients with Barrett's esophagus), the scores are measured, on a scale of 0 to 10 from round 1 (pre-exposure) to round 2 (post-exposure) and observe how the assay impacts confidence in the physician following evidence-based patient care., 1 year
Capsulomics has developed a prognostic assay for patients with diagnosed Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study will measure how gastroenterologists make surveillance and treatment management decisions for virtual patient cases when presented with different clinical and prognostic assay information. The data from this study will be published in a peer-review scientific journal.
