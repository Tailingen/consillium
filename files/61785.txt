DEVICE: SECM Skin Imaging
Ability of SECM device to image skin and skin diseases, The quality, resolution and depth of the images will be reviewed by the PI. This is a qualitative analysis to determine the feasibility of the device, the parameters mentioned will be compared to correlative data obtained from the dermatoscope control. Unit measurements are not available., Imaging data is collected during the procedure, and analyzed within 1 year of collection.
SECM provides an order of magnitude faster imaging speed than conventional confocal microscopy devices. The investigators have previously utilized the SECM technology for imaging large area of human esophagus in vivo. They have also developed endoscopic capsule devices which have been used to safely image over 60 human subjects, healthy volunteers and subjects with eosinophilic esophagitis, using SECM technology, rapidly.

When used for skin imaging, SECM can provide real-time three-dimensional confocal imaging and significantly reduce the imaging time. While SECM has been successfully used for imaging human esophagus in vivo, its utility in skin imaging needs to be tested in a new pilot study. The investigators will be taking images with a dermatoscope as well. This will the control to compare the experimental images to, as the dermatoscope is the standard of care diagnostic tool for dermatologists.
