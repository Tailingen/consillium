Study of Epratuzumab (hLL2) in Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
The purpose of this study is to determine whether epratuzumab provides effective therapy in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM).
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: Epratuzumab (hLL2- anti-CD22 humanized antibody)
Serum measurements of IgM will be the primary determination of efficacy.
This multi-center, single-arm study of epratuzumab is in patients with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) who failed chemotherapy. After baseline evaluations, patients receive epratuzumab infused over approximately 30-60 minutes at 360 mg/m2, administered once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks (days 1, 8, 15, 22). Post-treatment evaluations occur on the day of the last infusion, then at 6 and 12 weeks. Patients without progression of disease continue long-term follow up until disease progression or for at least 5 years, with evaluations every 3 months for 2 years, then semi-annually. Otherwise, follow-up is only required until resolution of any treatment related abnormalities.
