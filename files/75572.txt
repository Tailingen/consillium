Comparison of Two-treadmill Test Protocols to Evaluate Endurance in People With Cancer
During this study the investigators will compare the use of two treadmill tests in people diagnosed with cancer. The STEEP treadmill protocol is often used to evaluate the endurance of people diagnosed with cancer, however, since it is based on step increases in speed or ramp, it may not related to normal function. The new test, which is based on the body response to increased activity has not been used with people with cancer but may provide a better approximation of endurance demands during daily function. Our question is whether the new treadmill test can be used to evaluate aerobic function with people with cancer better than the STEEP treadmill test.
