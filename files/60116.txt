Mavrostobart (PT199) is an anti-CD73 mAb with a differentiated mechanism of action and is expected to completely inhibit CD73 enzyme activity. Mavrostobart (PT199) is designed to counter the adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, rendering anti-tumor immune cells to be more active and more responsive to checkpoint immunotherapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

CD73 is widely overexpressed in a number of different cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), gastric carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), sarcomas and glioblastomas. Thus, targeting CD73 may provide benefit for patients with a high CD73 expression in their tumor.

Mavrostobart (PT199) addresses the limitations of current CD73 inhibitors and is expected to increase antitumor immune activation, especially in combination with PD-1 pathway inhibition, and thus offer a new treatment option for cancer patients.

NSCLC is known to have a high expression level of CD73, and emerging clinical data has shown that targeting CD73 may provide clinical benefit, when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and/or standard of care chemotherapies to overcome treatment resistance.
