Safety of Prodencel in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
This phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of Prodencel (an autologous dendritic cell therapeutic tumor vaccine.) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Prodencel; an autologous dendritic cell therapeutic tumor vaccine
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) during Induction Immunization, AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 2 weeks after the third administration
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) during Booster Immunization, AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to approximately 1 year
This is a single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety of delivering a dendritic cell vaccine in fifteen to twenty-four (n=15-24) adult patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma after novel androgen-deprived therapy and docetaxel chemotherapy failure. The study is constructed in a 3+3 design for three steps of dose escalation with rigorous and mandatory safety monitoring. Subjects received the vaccine at a dose of 5-15Ã—10\^6 cells every two weeks for a total of 3 doses. A dose from cohort 1-3 is recommended for booster immunization every 4 weeks until disease progression or intolerance, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the booster immunization of Prodencel. Subjects will be monitored for adverse events as dictated by CTCAE version 5.
