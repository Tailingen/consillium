The Vitality Project for Fatigued Female Cancer Survivors
This parallel, randomized, non-inferiority trial will examine whether a ten week qigong intervention is not inferior to a ten week exercise-nutrition comparison group in reducing fatigue in cancer survivors. To build a more mechanistic understanding of physiological changes associated with fatigue reduction, it will secondly collect several different types of data to build an integrative brain-body model of vigor in cancer survivorship including:

1. data related to neural correlates of body awareness: cortical EEG data measuring each subject's ability to use attention to control neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (replication of Kerr et al 2011 study in mindfulness), and resting state fMRI measures of insular connectivity with nodes of the default mode network and salience network
2. data related to inflammation measured via inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 and tnf-alpha)
3. data related to cardiorespiratory functioning including cardiac impedance (ICG) and mechanical lung function
4. data related to parasympathetic and sympathetic signaling between the nervous system and the rest of the periphery.

The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic effects of movement and body awareness on recovery from cancer-related fatigue. In the current study, 60-80 female cancer survivors with cancer-related fatigue will be recruited who have been out of treatment for at least eight weeks. They will be randomized to either a 10-week qigong contemplative movement course or a 10 -week exercise-nutrition course. This study is designed as a non-inferiority trial to test the primary hypothesis that a ten week qigong intervention is not inferior to a ten week exercise-nutrition active comparator group in reducing fatigue in female cancer survivors (assessed via the FACIT-Fatigue scale). If non-inferiority is demonstrated during analysis, the data will be further analyzed to examine whether the qigong group significantly decreases fatigue more than the healthy living comparison group. The FACIT-Fatigue scale will be delivered at three time points: before the intervention starts (T1), after it ends (T2), and three months after the intervention has ended (T3). Further, this study will directly examine the underlying physiological mechanisms by which each intervention exerts its effects. Participants will be tested pre (T1) and post (T2) intervention on a variety of measures across multiple bodily and brain systems (eg EEG, fMRI, EMG, ECG, ICG, mechanical lung function, Doppler flowmetry, serum cytokines, muscle strength, 6 min walk test) to assess changes in these systems that are associated with reduction of fatigue and improvement of the subjective sense of vitality and energy. The data will be used to test whether conscious attention to bodily sensations cultivated in contemplative movement practices (i.e. Qigong) can actually impact levels of inflammation in the periphery as well as cortical measures of interoceptive awareness (ie resting state insula connectivity), and whether these changes will be associated with fatigue reduction. The secondary hypothesis is that decreased inflammation levels in the blood will be correlated with reduction in fatigue at post intervention as well as changes in neural markers of interoceptive and bodily awareness, and that this effect will be stronger in the qigong group.
