Bone Loss Treatment From Adjuvant Zoledronate Efficacy
The main purpose of this study is to observe and assess the impact of adjuvant zoledronate on bone density in breast cancer patients.

The second purposes:

* The efficacy of adjuvant zoledronate
* The safety of adjuvant zoledronate
* The bone loss of breast cancer patients in Guangdong
* The correlation between bone loss of breast cancer patients and treatment of disease in Guangdong

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignant disease and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women.

Zoledronate is a bone-targeted bisphosphonate, which is used to treat osteoporosis and to reduce the risk of skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronate can also reduce the persistence of disseminated tumour cells in the bone marrow of women with early-stage breast cancer. Nowadays, consensus is emerging that certain subsets of patients with early-stage breast cancer may benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.
