A Trial of All-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) in Advanced Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
This research is studying how safe and effective all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is to treat advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: Tretinoin
Best Overall Response Rate, CR 0, PR 0, SD 11, PD 5, UE 2

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. SD=stable disease, PD=progression of disease, UE=unevaluable, up to 8 months
Complete Response, CR rate captured up to 8 months

SD=stable disease, PD=progression of disease, UE=unevaluable, up to 8 months|Progression Free Survival, Median PFS or progression free survival

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. SD=stable disease, PD=progression of disease (Progression was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions), UE=unevaluable, up to 8 months|Duration Of Therapeutic Response, Duration of CR+PR

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. SD=stable disease, PD=progression of disease, UE=unevaluable, up to 8 months
Number of Participants With no/Low, Medium MYB Expression in ACC Tumors, correlative measure of ATRA inhibitory effect measured by IHC (units: % MYB inhibition by IHC quantitative measurement; MYB IHC was performed on stained tissue slides from baseline tumors and scored (%) by an expert pathologist as no/low, medium, and high MYB expressing)., up to 8 months
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

The main purpose of this study is to see how effective all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is in treating tumor. Other reasons for conducting the study are:

* To determine for how long all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) may reduce the size or slow down the growth of tumor
* To evaluate levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released in the bloodstream as an indication of the disease activity
* To better understand mechanisms of tumor resistance to ATRA
