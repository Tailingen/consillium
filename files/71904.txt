SAR650984, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Combination in RRMM Patients
Primary Objectives:

Part A: To evaluate the safety and determine the recommended dose of SAR650984 in combination with pomalidomide (P) and dexamethasone (d), in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).

Part B: To evaluate the feasibility of isatuximab administered from a fixed infusion volume in combination with Pd as assessed by occurrence of grade ≥3 infusion associated reactions (IAR).

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the infusion duration (Part B).
* To evaluate the safety profile of the combination with isatuximab administration from fixed volume (Part B).
* To evaluate immunogenicity of SAR650984 in combination with Pd (Part A and B).
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and its effect on the PK of pomalidomide when administered in combination (Part A).
* To describe the efficacy of the combination of SAR650984 with Pd in terms of overall response rate and clinical benefit rate based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria and the duration of response (Part A and B).
* To assess the relationship between clinical effects (adverse event \[AE\] and/or tumor response) and CD38 receptor density at baseline (Part A).

The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 21 days. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, or other reason for discontinuation. After study treatment discontinuation an end of treatment (EOT) visit will be done at approximately 30 days after last study treatment component administration to assess safety. If the last ADA sample is positive or inconclusive, additional ADA will be sampled 3 months later. No further ADA will be sampled, even if this 3-month sample is positive. Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression of disease will be followed every month until progression or initiation of subsequent therapy, for a maximum of one year, whichever comes first.
