A Study of SI-B003 and BL-B01D1+SI-B003 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors
Phase II: To explore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BL-B01D1+SI-B003 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to further explore the optimal dose and mode of combination.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: BL-B01D1|DRUG: SI-B003
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of SI-B003., Up to approximately 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of medication to disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any adverse and unexpected change in body structure, function, or chemistry or any exacerbation of an existing condition (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) during treatment. The type, frequency, and severity of TEAE will be assessed during treatment., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase II: To explore the efficacy of BL-B01D1+SI-B003 combination in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To explore the safety and tolerability of BL-B01D1+SI-B003 combination in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to further explore the optimal dose and mode of combination.
