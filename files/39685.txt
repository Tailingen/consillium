Trilaciclib Combined With Chemotherapy for Perioperative Treatment of Osteosarcoma
This study is a prospective, single arm phase II study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of trilaciclib before perioperative chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Trilaciclib
The incidence of grade â‰¥ 3 neutropenia during chemotherapy treatment, Is the number of neutrophils in the blood routine test lower than the ninth power of 1.0 \* 10/L, 1-2 weeks after chemotherapy
The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia during chemotherapy treatment, Is the number of neutrophils in the blood routine test lower than the ninth power of 0.5 \* 10/L, 1-2 weeks after chemotherapy|The occurrence of grade 3 or grade 4 thrombocytopenia during chemotherapy treatment, Is the number of platelet in the blood routine test lower than the ninth power of 50 or 25 \* 10/L, 1-3 weeks after chemotherapy|The incidence of grade 3 or 4 anemia during chemotherapy treatment, Is the number of hemoglobin in the blood routine test lower than 80g/L, 1-3 weeks after chemotherapy
This study is a prospective, single arm phase II study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of Trilaciclib before perioperative chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma.Patients diagnosed by pathology and evaluated by surgeons as having non metastatic resectable osteosarcoma, after signing informed consent, will be screened for eligible subjects to receive a treatment regimen of tralazilide before perioperative chemotherapy;

The study will include 20 participants who will receive the following design scheme:

During the preoperative neoadjuvant therapy period, the subjects will receive two cycles of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy:Trilaciclib is administered daily within 4 hours before chemotherapy, 240mg/m2, intravenously; The chemotherapy regimen is MAP regimen (doxorubicin 75mg/m2, cisplatin 120mg/m2, methotrexate 8-12g/m2); Recombinant human endostatin: 210 mg, CIV 72 hours, administration method: continuous intravenous infusion, starting from the first day of each cycle; The subject underwent preoperative imaging evaluation and surgical indication evaluation one week after the end of the last medication before surgery. Subjects who still have indications for surgery after completing the two cycles before neoadjuvant therapy will receive surgical treatment within one week.

One week after surgery, the subjects began to receive a combination of trilaciclib chemotherapy (MAP regimen) and recombinant human endostatin adjuvant therapy for four cycles; Monitor adverse events (AE) throughout the entire study process and assess their severity level according to the guidelines listed in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Standards for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or higher. Safety follow-up will be conducted on subjects receiving study treatment and early discontinuation of medication. The total survival of all subjects will be followed up until death, withdrawal of informed consent, or end of the study.
