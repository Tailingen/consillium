Combination Nab-paclitaxel (N-P) and Nintedanib or N-P and Placebo in Relapsed NSCLC Adenocarcinoma
A PHASE I/II TRIAL OF COMBINATION NAB-PACLITAXEL AND NINTEDANIB OR NAB-PACLITAXEL AND PLACEBO IN RELAPSED NSCLC ADENOCARCINOMA
NSCLC, Recurrent|Adenocarcinoma of Lung
DRUG: Vargatef|DRUG: Abraxane|OTHER: placebo
Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose, To define Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1, 1 and 2 years from patients commencement
Part 1 and 2: Adverse Events Review, To examine the frequency of all Adverse Events graded by NCI-CTCAE version 4.0, 4 years from Start date of trial|Part 1 and 2: RECIST Response, To examine the objective tumour response according to RECIST 1.1, 4 years from start date of trial|Cycles Tolerated, To define the number of cycles of nab-paclitaxel with nintedanib given, 4 years from start date of trial|Part 2: Overall Survival, To examine overall survival in the ITT and predefined subgroups (PD pre/post 9 months from start of first line chemotherapy; prior or no prior immunotherapy)., 9 months post Chemotherapy
Part 2: Progression Free Survival, To explore PFS rate at 12 weeks from first dose of nab-paclitaxel with nintedanib/placebo, 12 weeks post first dose of treatment and ongoing until end of study
The study is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 is the Phase Ib portion of the trial and Part 2 is the Phase II portion of the trial. Once the Trial Steering Committee has completed the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment for Part 1 and confirmed RP2D for Part 2, Part 2 enrolment will proceed. The objective(s) for each part are as follows:

Part 1: The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination nab-paclitaxel and nintedanib in patients with stage IIIb and IV adenocarcinoma of the lung in second and third treatment line setting and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nintedanib when given with nab-paclitaxel at 100mg/m2 d1, d8 q21.

Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 is to explore the efficacy of combination nab-paclitaxel and nintedanib versus nab-paclitaxel and placebo in the same patient population, with nintedanib/placebo given at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as defined during part 1 of the study.
