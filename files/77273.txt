Liver Function Test (LFT) Elevations in Cancer Patients and Users of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs
A retrospective cohort study using the LabRx medical claims database will be performed to address these objectives. The primary objective of this project is to examine the background rates of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in cancer patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
Cancer
DRUG: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Number of Patients With ALT (Alanine Transaminase) >=3x (Times) Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), Prevalence of patients with an ALT elevation \>=3x ULN among patients who had liver function testing during the baseline period (30 days prior to initiation of TKI drug)., Study period was October 1, 2004-June 30, 2009. Patients had at least 91 days of follow-up post index date.|Incidence of ALT >=3x ULN, Number of patients with ALT \>=3 times ULN among patients with a normal ALT measurement during the baseline period (30 days prior to initiation of TKI drug).

Patients had at least 91 days of follow-up post index date.|Incidence of Hy's Law (ALT or AST >=3x ULN and ALP <2x ULN and BIL >=2x ULN), Number of patients with Hy's Law (ALT or AST \>= 3x ULN and ALP \<2x ULN and BIL \>= 2x ULN) among patients with normal ALT, AST, ALP, and BIL measurements during the baseline period (30 days prior to initiation of TKI drug). Normal is defined as an ALT AST, ALP, and BIL \<1 times ULN at baseline., Study period was October 1, 2004-June 30, 2009. Patients had at least 91 days of follow-up post index date.

Patients were not recruited for nor enrolled in this study. This study is a retrospective observational study. Data from medical records or insurance claims databases are anonymised and used to develop a patient cohort. All diagnoses and treatment are recorded in the course of routine medical practice.
