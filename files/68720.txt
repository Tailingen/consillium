Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients whose tumor is significantly reduced., at least 3 weeks after the first treatment
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) and will be conducted in the whole study population. It is designed to include progression events as determined by the investigators per RECIST 1.1 or death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is the time from enrollment to death of any cause or the last follow-up (censored)., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Safety (treatment-related adverse effects), The incidence and severity of toxicity will be summarized according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0., From the first treatment to 30 days after the end of study.
Patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus and had progression from first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic ESCC, or progression within 6 months after neoadjuvant, definitive, or adjuvant chemo(radio) -therapy for loco-regional ESCC would be eligible for this trial. Eligible patients will receive daily 40mg cabozantinib plus i.v. atezolizumab 1200mg Q3W for treatment response evaluation. Primary endpoint is the objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety profiles.
