Electroacupuncture Plus Antiemetic Therapy for Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients With Breast Cancer
This study explores the effectiveness of combining electroacupuncture with olanzapine-containing four-drug antiemetic therapy to mitigate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with breast cancer. The research aims to assess the adjunctive benefits of electroacupuncture in enhancing the antiemetic effects of conventional medication, particularly in the context of highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. By investigating the synergistic potential of these modalities, the study seeks to provide insights into optimizing supportive care strategies for patients with breast cancer undergoing intensive chemotherapy treatment.

Proportion of Patients Free from Nausea Throughout Treatment, The proportion of patients experiencing no nausea is determined by those who register a score of 0 on the visual-analogue scale for nausea throughout the entirety of treatment, spanning from initiation of chemotherapy to 120 hours post-treatment., 120 hours
This study is a randomized controlled trial conducted in parallel groups, with blinding implemented. It aims to assess the effectiveness of combining electroacupuncture with standard quadruple antiemetic drugs for patients with breast cancer undergoing HEC.

Both study arms will be administered Olanzapine, Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, serotonin receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone at the commencement of HEC on Day 1. Subsequently, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either electroacupuncture or sham acupuncture.

Participants will be responsible for recording all instances of nausea and vomiting, as well as documenting the use of rescue antiemetic medications.

The study will evaluate primary and secondary outcomes, as well as monitor adverse events.
