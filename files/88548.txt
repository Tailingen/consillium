Machine Learning-based Surgical Guidance System for Robot-assisted Rectal Surgery
The aim of the study is to evaluate the technical feasibility and applicability of a surgical assistance system based on image recognition algorithms in a first-in-human pilot study. In addition, this study will provide preliminary data on the oncological outcome of the assistance system.

Incidence of discrepancies between the surgeon's preparation and the prediction of the CoBot system, System discrepancy score quantifying major misspecifications of the CoBot system in comparison to the surgeon's action, 72 hours after Surgery
Operating time [min], Time from skin incision until placement of last skin staple/suture, During Surgery|Duration of postoperative hospital stay [days], Postoperative day 1 until day of discharge, At day of discharge, assessed up to 90 days|Duration of postoperative intermediate/intensive care unit stay [days], Postoperative day 1 until day of discharge, At day of discharge, assessed up to 90 days|Assessment of pelvic function before and after rectal resection, Rectal and urogenital function will be assessed preoperatively and 12-24 months postoperatively using the PERIFUNC score questionnaire, resulting in a score between 0 and 120. Higher scores mean a worse outcome (worse pelvic function)., 24 months|Rectal sphincter function before and after rectal resection, Sphincter function will be assessed by manometry preoperatively and 12 - 24 months postoperatively, 24 months|Frequency of peri-operative morbidity after resection, Frequency of peri-operative complications after surgery, 24 months|Kind of peri-operative morbidity after resection, Kind of peri-operative complications after surgery, 24 months|Assessment of usability of guidance system, Surgeon questionnaire, the questionnaire qualitatively assesses nine items, each item scoring from "not at all" to "very much", evaluated individually, 48 hours after surgery|Assessment of the difficulty of the preparation, Surgeon questionnaire, the questionnaire qualitatively assesses nine items, each item scoring from "not at all" to "very much", evaluated individually, 48 hours after surgery|Assessment of oncological outcomes: Frequency of Overall survival (OS), The overall survival of all patients is assessed between operation date to date of death of any cause, 24 months|Assessment of oncological outcomes: Frequency of Progression Free survival (PFS), The progression free survival of all patients is assessed between operation date to date of tumor progression, 24 months|Assessment of oncological outcomes: Frequency of Loco-Regional Tumor Free Survival (LRFS), The Loco-Regional Tumor Free Survival of all patients is assessed between operation date to date of local tumor relapse, 24 months
