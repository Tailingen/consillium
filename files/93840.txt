Transcriptomic Analysis and Optical Coherence Tomography Combined for Patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this observational study is to learn if tape strip for transcriptomic (RNA) analysis and optical coherence tomography (OCT) combined can optimize noninvasive management of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) patients.

The main question of the study is to examine if the combination of these two techniques, transcriptomic and OCT, can improve noninvasive detection of human BCCs.

All included patients will undergo 1) an OCT scan and 2) a tape strip collection for transcriptomic analysis from the same BCC.
