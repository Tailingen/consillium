Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Compare With Cytoreduction and Chemotherapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Patients
Patients with newly diagnosed Acute lymphoblastic leukemia after providing consent, will be screened for eligibility. Eligible patients will be treated with Vincristine (1 mg/m2 at Day 1 and Day 8), Dexamethasone 24 mg/d day 1-15 and IT at Days 1, 4, 8 and 12. At day 14 patients will be randomized in two group. BMT group who have donor and Chemotherapy group who don't have suitable donor. BMT group treated with allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation and Chemotherapy treated with Cyclophosphamide at day 15, Daunorubicin at day 15-18, Vincristine at day 15 and 22 and Dexamethasone at day 12-28 followed by standard chemotherapy. In BMT group patients will be received CNS radiotherapy at +100 day after transplantation.
