Acalabrutinib in Combination With ACP-319, for Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combined use of acalabrutinib and ACP-319, for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: acalabrutinib|DRUG: ACP-319
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The frequency (number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs will be reported in each treatment group by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Summaries will also be presented by the severity of the AE (per CTCAE, v4.03) and by relationship to study drug., From date of randomization until the day of documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 cycles of 28 days.
Drug Exposure, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve, PK sample schedule: Cycle 1 - Up to 30 minutes before dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours after the morning dose of Day 1 and 28. Also, 30 min before morning dose of cycle 1 - day 8,15 \& 22, cycle 2 - day 15 \& 28, and cycle 3 to 6 - day 28., From 30 min before first dose to day-28 of cycle-6 of a 28 day cycle|Drug Exposure, Maximum observed plasma concentration, PK sample schedule: Cycle 1 - Up to 30 minutes before dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours after the morning dose of Day 1 and 28. Also, 30 min before morning dose of cycle 1 - day 8,15 \& 22, cycle 2 - day 15 \& 28, and cycle 3 to 6 - day 28., From 30 min before first dose to 30 min before day-28 of cycle-6 of 28 day cycles|Drug Exposure, Time of the maximum plasma concentration, PK sample schedule: Cycle 1 - Up to 30 minutes before dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, and 24 hours after the morning dose of Day 1 and 28. Also, 30 min before morning dose of cycle 1 - day 8,15 \& 22, cycle 2 - day 15 \& 28, and cycle 3 to 6 - day 28., From 30 min before first dose till 30 before day-28 of cycle-6 of 28 day cycles|Overall Response rate, A CT scan with contrast (unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any other disease sites are required for the pretreatment tumor assessment., Pretreatment, then end of cycles 2, 4, 9, 12, 18 and then every 6 cycles to cycle 36. After that at cycle 48 and 60 of 28 day cycles.|Duration of Response, The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response or Partial Response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent disease or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the study treatment started). Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves and corresponding quantiles (including the median)., Pretreatment, then end of cycles 2, 4, 9, 12, 18 and then every 6 cycles to cycle 36. After that at cycle 48 and 60 of 28 day cycles.|Progression-Free Survival, PFS is measured from the time of first study drug administration until the first date that recurrent disease or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the study treatment started). Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the event-free curves and corresponding quantiles (including the median)., Pretreatment, then end of cycles 2, 4, 9, 12, 18 and then every 6 cycles to cycle 36. After that at cycle 48 and 60 of 28 day cycles.
