Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycine in Patients With COVID-19 and Hematological Malignancies (HYACINTHE)
The primary objective of this phase 2, multicentric, placebo-controlled double-blind, randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycine on the viral load drop at day 5 among patients with COVID-19 and hematological malignancies.

DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate 200 MG [Plaquenil]|DRUG: Azithromycin 250 MG Oral Capsule|DRUG: Placebo oral tablet|DRUG: Placebo oral capsule
Evaluation of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromyncine on the viral load drop at day 5., Locally evaluated rate of viral response. Favorable response is defined as (1) complete response : negative PCR (absence of detectable signal with a minimum of 40 cycles) or (2) major response : detectable signal but with an increased number of cycles \> or egal to 10 compared to initial PCR. Response failure is defined as (1) minor response : detectable signal but with an increased number of cycles \< 10 compared to initial PCR or (2) stabilisation or worsening of the viral load., 5 days of treatment

The study will evaluate the effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycine versus placebo among 114 patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancy.

After randomization in 1:1 ratio, patients will receive either the study treatment or placebo :

* Patients enrolled in the experimental arm will receive hydroxychloroquine (200mgx3 tablets per day during 10 days) and azithromycine (500 mg at day 1 then 250mg per day during 4 days)
* Patients enrolled in the control arm will receive a placebo of hydroxychloroquine (3 tablets per day during 10 days) and a placebo of azithromycine (2 capsules at day 1, then 1 capsule per day during 4 days)
