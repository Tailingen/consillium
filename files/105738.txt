Expanded Access to Provide Selitrectinib for the Treatment of Cancers With a NTRK Gene Fusion
Selitrectinib expanded access is for minor and adult patients with cancer having a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion). The patients are ineligible for an ongoing selitrectinib clinical trial or have other considerations that prevent access to selitrectinib through an existing clinical trial. Expanded access is intended to treat individual patients with different types of cancers with a NTRK gene fusion, including blood cancers, who have previously received tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor therapy.
