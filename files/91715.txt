Combination of Immune Checkpoint in Locally Advanced or Metastatic MSI/dMMR Esogastric Adenocarcinomas
CIME is a multicenter, randomised, comparative, open-label phase III study aiming to compare the survival of patients suffering from MSI-H/dMMR locally advanced or metastatic oeasogastric adenocarcinoma treated by a bi-immunotherapy (experimental arm) versus standard current treatment (FOLFOX/XELOX + nivolumab : standard arm).
Gastric Cancer|MSI-H|Metastatic Cancer|Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Balstilimab|DRUG: Botensilimab|DRUG: Folfox Protocol|DRUG: XELOX|DRUG: Nivolumab
Survival of patients, Comparison of survival of patients under Botensilimab + Balstilimab versus the standard of care FOLFOX/XELOX + nivolumab, at least 2 years
Progression free survival, At least 2 years|Objective response rate, After 16 weeks of treatment|Duration of response, At least 2 years|Adverse Event description as assessed by CTCAE V5.0, from the date of first intake of study drug until 90 days after study drug discontinuation or at time of initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment|EORTC QLQ C30, At screening, at Cycle1 Day1 pre dose and every 8 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression (assessed at least 24 months follow up)
Gene expression and genomic profile description, RNA Sequencing, At Cycle 1 Day1, at Cycle4 Day1, at visit 30 days after the last dose (each cycle is 14 or 21 days)|Gene expression and genomic profile description, Whole Exome Sequencing, At Cycle 1 Day1, at Cycle4 Day1, at visit 30 days after the last dose (each cycle is 14 or 21 days)|Number of tumor samples with modification of tumor microenvironment under study treatments, Multi-immunofluorescence to assess the expression of immune and tumor cells markers such as PDL1, TIGIT, LAG3 on tumor samples collected before and during the treatment, Cycle 1 Day pre-dose (before the first treatment administration), Cycle 4 Day 1 (i.e. 42 days after 1st dose), in case of disease progression (assessed up to 24 months after randomisation)|Value of Tumor mutational Burden (Mutation/ Megabase) on tumor and blood (circulating tumor DNA) during treatment, Cycle 1 Day pre-dose (before the first treatment administration), Cycle 4 Day 1 (i.e. 42 days after 1st dose), in case of disease progression (assessed up to 24 months after randomisation)
