A Study of ERAS-007 as Monotherapy or in Combination With ERAS-601 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ERAS-007 monotherapy administered once weekly (QW) and twice daily-once weekly (BID-QW).
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose (RD) of ERAS-007 monotherapy administered BID-QW.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ERAS-007 monotherapy.
* To determine the optimal dose and schedule of ERAS-007 monotherapy.
* To evaluate antitumor activity of ERAS-007 in various solid tumors.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ERAS-007 (BID-QW) and ERAS-601 (twice daily for three weeks on and 1 week off (BID 3/1)) when administered in combination.
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose (RD) of ERAS-007 administered in combination with ERAS-601.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ERAS-007 and ERAS-601 when administered in combination.
* To evaluate antitumor activity of ERAS-007 and ERAS-601 when administered in combination in various solid tumors
* To evaluate antitumor activity of ERAS-007 and ERAS-601 when administered in combination in various solid tumors

This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter clinical study of ERAS-007 monotherapy (QW or BID-QW) administered either QW or BID-QWand ERAS-007 (BID-QW) in combination with ERAS-601 (BID 3/1). The monotherapy RD on a weekly schedule has been determined to be 250 mg QW in a previous study. The dose escalation phases of this study will test ERAS-007 monotherapy administered BID-QW as a monotherapy or in combination with ERAS-601 in participants with any solid tumor. The monotherapy RD on a weekly schedule has been determined to be 250 mg QW in a previous study. In parallel, the dose expansion phase of this study will test ERAS-007 monotherapy administered at the RD of 250 mg QW in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring specific molecular alterations. Once sufficient safety and PK data are available from the BID-QW dose escalation phase, the Sponsor will then determine the optimal dose and schedule of ERAS-007 administered as a monotherapy.
