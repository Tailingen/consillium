Clinical Study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection Combined With Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Monotherapy in Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Who Failed Platinum-containing Treatment
This is a randomized, open-label, positive-controlled, multicenter Phase ле study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection combined with capecitabine versus capecitabine monotherapy in patients with recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Recurrent Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the independent review committee (IRC), Progression-Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death, Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the date of diagnosis to death or last follow-up, with no restriction on the cause of death., Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator and IRC, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment, Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by the investigator and IRC, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents, Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) assessed by the investigator and IRC, Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of the first occurrence of PD, or until the date of death, Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the investigator, Progression-Free Survival PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death, Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Frequency and severity of AE (NCI CTCAE 5.0), Throughout the study period, up to approximately 2 years|Blood concentrations of total and free mitoxantrone, At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)
Five hundred patients with recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group will receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection combined with capecitabine, and the control group will receive capecitabine alone. All patients will be treated until disease progression as determined by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, intolerable toxicity, subject withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of new antitumor therapy, loss of follow-up, death, or study completion, whichever occurs first. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two groups.
