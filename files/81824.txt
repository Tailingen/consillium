Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Treating Women With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) 2-Positive Primary Breast Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate Herceptin treatment for 1 year and 2 years (versus observation/no Herceptin) in women with HER2-overexpressing primary breast cancer who have completed (neo-)adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, definitive surgery, and radiotherapy, if applicable.
