Advanced or Recurrent Solid Tumors Treated With SHetA2
The purpose of this research is to test the safety of the study drug (OK-1) and see what effects (good and bad) this drug has on patients with recurrent solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: OK-1
Number of dose-limiting toxicities of treatment with OK-1, 21 days|Dosage Recommendation for Phase 2, 21 days
Rate of objective response, up to three years|Median duration of response, up to three years|Rate of disease control, up to three years|Median progression free survival, up to three years|Median overall survival, up to three years|Incidence of adverse events, safety and tolerability of OK-1 using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0, up to three years|Tmax of PK plasma concentration, 24 hours|Cmax of PK plasma concentration, 24 hours|AUC of PK plasma concentration, 24 hours|t1/2 of PK plasma concentration, 24 hours
OK-1 capsules will be given twice a day, every day in 21-day blocks of time. Each block of time is called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated until the patient or doctor no longer feel participation in the study is right for the patient. There will be lab tests and examinations to monitor the patients progress. We expect that taking part in this research will last up to three years.
