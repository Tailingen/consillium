124I-FIAU Imaging in EBV and KSHV Associated Cancers
This research is being done to determine whether viral thymidine kinase (TK) expression in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) virus-associated tumors is sufficient to image.

OTHER: FIAU-PET-CT-2|OTHER: FIAU-PET-CT-4
To evaluate the potential for enzymatic targeting as evidenced by the ability to image 124I-FIAU tracer uptake in tumor at baseline and following chemotherapy or biologic therapy with agents that may induce viral TK activation., Baseline, Days 1-3 post chemo
To describe changes in viral DNA in plasma as a function of chemotherapy and the association with imaging by FIAU-PET, Baseline, pre chemo, post chemo, day 8 post chemo
EBV and KSHV are associated with a variety of malignancies including some lymphomas, carcinomas and other malignancies. We anticipate that viral TK expression will differ among tumor types and will be adjusted with standard chemotherapies and some investigational agents. This exploratory study is aimed in part at evaluating whether standard regimens or investigational regimens might bring about sufficient activation of the EBV-TK or KSHV-TK in tumors to be therapeutically useful if used in conjunction with FIAU as a radiopharmaceutical.
