Timing of Specific Exercise Therapy After Breast Cancer Surgery: Early Versus Delayed Initiation
This single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare two timings for initiating specific exercise therapy after breast cancer surgery. The study tests whether early initiation (within the first postoperative week) versus delayed initiation (at 3 weeks postoperative) results in superior upper limb function at 6 months as measured by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) and wound-related complications such as drainage time and hematoma incidence.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Specific Exercise Therapy
Upper Limb Function (DASH Questionnaire), The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a validated measure of upper limb function. The questionnaire is scored on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no disability and 100 represents the most severe disability. Lower scores indicate better upper limb function., Assessed preoperatively (baseline) and at 6 months postoperative.
Pain Intensity (Visual Analog Scale - VAS), A 0-100 VAS will measure patient-reported pain levels, where 0 signifies no pain and 100 the worst pain imaginable., Assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative.|Wound-Related Complications - Drainage Time (Days), The duration of wound drainage will be recorded in days. Longer drainage time may indicate wound complications., Monitored during the immediate postoperative period up to 3 months.|Wound-Related Complications - Incidence of Hematoma, The occurrence of hematoma will be documented as a binary outcome (presence or absence) for each patient. The incidence will be calculated as the proportion of patients developing hematoma during the monitoring period., Monitored during the immediate postoperative period up to 3 months.
