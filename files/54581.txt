Cetuximab in Refractory Colorectal Cancer With K-RAS Mutated and Favorable FcγRIIa (CD32) Genotype
This national, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study without any control arm aims to evaluate the activity of cetuximab monotherapy in the treatment of refractory colorectal cancer in subjects with K-RAS mutated and FcγRIIa polymorphism tumors, in which there is no therapeutic alternative for treatment. Failure of the first and second line conventional therapeutic lines was documented.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Cetuximab
Overall Survival (OS) Time, Overall survival was defined as the time from date of informed consent signature until death., From the date of informed consent signature until death, assessed up to 3 years
Percentage of Subjects With Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as those subjects achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1). For target lesions (TLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs; PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) SLD; Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient decrease in SLD to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in SLD to qualify for PD; and PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started. For non-target lesions (NTLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels; SD was defined as the persistence of 1 or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker levels above normal limits; and progressive disease (PD) was defined as the appearance, From the date of informed consent signature until progressive disease, assessed up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS was defined as the time from informed consent signature until PD or death, whatever occurred first. Subjects who did not have disease progression or were lost to follow-up, were censored at the date of last contact, known to be alive and progression free; moreover, those subjects who started a new treatment (different from cetuximab), were censored at the date of starting the new treatment. For TLs, PD was defined at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from BL or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For NTLs, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Participants without second-line PD or death were censored at the date of last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented., From the date of informed consent signature until progressive disease (PD) or death, assessed up to 3 years|Number of Subjects With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs Leading to Discontinuation, AEs Leading to Death, An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., From the date of enrollment up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration, assessed up to 3 years|Number of Subjects With Fcγ Receptors (FCγR) IIa/IIIa Polymorphisms, The antibody fragment C portion (FCy) of cetuximab interacts with Fc-gamma receptors (FCyRs) expressed by immune effector cells. Polymorphisms were described in genes coding for FCyRIIa and in FCyRIIIa. A histidine/arginine polymorphism at position 131 for FCyRIIa gene and valine ⁄ phenylalanine polymorphism at position 158 for the FCyRIIIa gene were reported to be functionally relevant in the ADCC mechanism. All subjects were analyzed and classified as carriers of every different polymorphism of FCy Receptors: for FCyRIIa (H/H, homozygous alleles with histidine and R/H, heterozygous alleles with arginine/histidine) and FCyRIIIa (V/V, homozygous alleles with valine, F/F, homozygous alleles with phenylalanine and F/V, heterozygous alleles with valine ⁄ phenylalanine) (units: subjects with every type of polymorphism) .The FCyR genotype was determined using a TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay., Baseline|Overall Survival (OS) Related to Codon G13D, OS was defined as the time from informed consent signature until death. Subjects without death were censored at the last date known alive (within the study)., From the date of informed consent signature until death, lost-to-follow-up or end of study, whatever occurred first (maximal up to 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS) Related to Killer Inhibitory Receptors 2DS4 (KIR2DS4) Functional Receptor (f/d) and Non-functional Receptor (NFR), OS was defined as the time from informed consent signature until death. Subjects without death were censored at the last date known alive (within the study)., From the date of informed consent signature until death, lost-to-follow-up or end of study, whatever occurred first (maximal assessed up to 3 years)|Beta 2-microglobulin, Baseline, Week 8
