BKM120 + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out the good and bad effects that occur when BKM120 is added to standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: BKM120 days 1 - 21 plus paclitaxel + carboplatin|DRUG: BKM120 (days 1 - 28, ) plus paclitaxel + carboplatin|DRUG: BKM120 (days 1-21) + paclitaxel (day 1) + carboplatin (day 1)|DRUG: BKM120, Paclitaxel + Carboplatin
To establish the phase II recommended dose of daily oral BKM120, for patients with advanced solid tumors, BKM120 in combination with two different schedules of paclitaxel and carboplatin., 2 years|EXPANSION COHORT A:To evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily oral BKM120 (100 mg) + paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) + carboplatin (AUC 6), both given intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, with pegfilgrastim support, 2 years|EXPANSION COHORT B: To obtain a preliminary description of efficacy of the regimen established in Group 1 among patients with tumors harboring PTEN mutation or homozygous deletion., 2 years
To describe the safety of BKM120 combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin,, Patients will be evaluated by MD at weekly clinic visits during Cycle 1, on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, and will have additional evaluations if clinically indicated. Toxicities will be assessed according to NCI common toxicity criteria (CTC) version 4.0, weekly clinic visits during Cycle 1, on Day 1 of subsequent cycles,|To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of daily BKM120., when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The area under the curve (AUC0→∞), half-life (t½), and maximum concentration (Cmax) for BKM120 will be determined by noncompartmental analysis.(except for Expansion Cohort B), 2 years|To describe and tabulate the radiographic response rate of BKM120 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel,, there is insufficient sample size to support a formal analysis of response rate. As such, radiographic response data will be tabulated and presented in descriptive form., 2 years|Correlative Tissue Studies, we will calculate the proportion of cases with positive staining of PTEN along with a 95% confidence interval, using the Clopper and Pearson method for exact small sample inference. For Sequenom Analysis, we will calculate the proportion of cases that are positive for each mutation, 2 years
The purpose of this study is to find out the good and bad effects that occur when BKM120 is added to standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
