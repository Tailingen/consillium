Quitting Matters Human Immunodeficiency Virus Hybrid Trial
The purpose of this study is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of two approaches for quitting smoking among people living with HIV (PWH). Participants will complete a 24- week (\~6-month) study where the Participants will be assigned to one of two smartphone apps to help with quitting smoking. Regardless of the group participants are assigned to, they will also receive a combination of nicotine replacement therapy (patches and gums) that have been shown to help people quit smoking. The main questions this study aims to answer are:

Participants will complete 5 video call visits over about 6 months. Participants will install their assigned smoking cessation app onto their phone and will be asked to use the app for the duration of the study along with their provided Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products. During the study visits, participants will meet with study staff to complete questionnaires and interviews. Participants may be asked to provide breath and saliva samples to measure the level of carbon monoxide and nicotine.

Biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24-weeks, Abstinence is determined by a self-report of not smoking any tobacco product for greater than or equal to 7 days prior to Week 24 and biochemically verified by an expired carbon monoxide breath test reading of \< 5 ppm at Week 24. If the participant does not meet both criteria, they are not considered abstinent. As per convention, participants are assumed to be smoking if they report smoking at the time-point, cannot be reached to provide data at the time-point, fail to provide a breath sample at the time-point, or provide a breath sample at the time-point that is greater than or equal to 5 ppm., 24 weeks

Tobacco use has alarmingly high rates among people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (PWH), 43% compared with 15% in the general population. Due to the development of highly effective treatments for HIV and the resulting increased longevity among PWH, this population now loses more life years to smoking than to HIV infection itself. Novel and effective models to deliver wider reaching smoking cessation interventions for PWH are highly needed and indicated as a priority for National Institute of Health. Digital therapeutics (DTx) may be a novel, scalable, and highly available approach for engaging and treating smoking in this population. However, although DTx for smoking cessation have been shown effective in the general population, no large trial to date has examined the effectiveness of a tailored DTx for smoking cessation in PWH, and no implementation science work has examined barriers and facilitators of implementation of DTx for smoking cessation in this population.
