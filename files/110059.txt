Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab and Nab-paclitaxel Combined With Low-dose Radiotherapy in Patients With Stage IVb Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study is a single-arm, prospective, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with stage IVb esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
ESCC
DRUG: Tislelizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR), It is defined as the number of subjects with the best response effect as complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) during the period from the start of the subjects receiving the treatment regimen of this study to the progression of the subjects' disease in the total number of subjects in the analysis data set. percentage of the population（%）., Up to 24 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the number of subjects whose tumors shrank or remained stable for a certain period of time from receiving the treatment regimen of this study to the progression of the subject's disease, including complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) in the analysis data set percentage of the total population（%）., Up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization to tumor progression in any aspect or death from any cause（Unit: month）.

Assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, analysis of this indicator included tumor evaluation results during study treatment and follow-up. If the patient has several indicators that can be judged as PD, the first indicator will be used for PFS analysis; recurrence, new lesions or death are considered to have reached the end of the study, and the patient is treated with other systemic or target-targeted anti-PD. Tumor treatment is also considered tumor progression., Up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause（Unit: month）., Up to 24 months|Drug-Related Safety Indicators, Exposure to the investigational drug and incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, including serious adverse events（n，%）。, Up to 24 months
This study is a single-center, prospective, single-arm, open-label study. It will explore the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with nab-paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of stage IVb esophageal squamous cell carcinoma on the basis of low-dose radiotherapy（40Gy/20f，5次/w）. To explore new treatment modalities and prolong patient survival.
