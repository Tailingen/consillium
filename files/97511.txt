Safety of PCI-32765 in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of orally administered PCI-32765 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.
B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: PCI-32765
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants who had experienced at least one treatment emergent AEs., From first dose to within 30 days of last dose of PCI-32765
Food Effect Cohort Assessments, Geometric mean ratio (Fed/Fasted) for PCI-32765 AUClast. The data were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24 h post-dose. The AUClast was calculated from 0 up to 24 hours post-dose., Fed was assessed on either Day 8 or Day 15 and Fasted was assessed on the remaining day as cross-over design.|Progression Free Survival Rate at 24 Months, Criteria for progression are as outlined in the IWCLL 2008 criteria (Hallek 2008) and as assessed by investigator, e.g. progression defined as a 50% increase in lymph node size., The median follow-up time for all treated patients are 21 month, range (0.7 month, 29 months).|Percentage of Participants Achieving Response, Response criteria are as outlined in the IWCLL 2008 criteria (Hallek 2008) and as assessed by investigator, e.g. response requires 50% reduction in lymph node size., The median follow-up time for all treated patients are 21 month, range (0.7 month, 29 months).
