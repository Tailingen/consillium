Imaging Tumor-infiltrating T-cells in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an interventional study, to assess feasibility and safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in neo-adjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC. Additional analyses of potential imaging biomarkers, e.g. Zr-89 labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736), ex vivo In-111-oxine labelled CD8+ T-cells and high-resolution immune cell imaging, in relation to immunotherapy induced immune responses on quantitative immune histochemical analysis of the resected tumor specimen, will be performed.

Safety of neo-adjuvant durvalumab: number of NCI CTCAE v 5.0 grade ≥3, Demonstrate safety of two courses durvalumab (MEDI4736) 750 mg at two weeks interval in neo-adjuvant setting. Safety is defined as the number of NCI CTCAE v 5.0 grade ≥3 toxicity related to neo-adjuvant durvalumab (MEDI4736)., 14 days|Feasibility of neo-adjuvant durvalumab: successful completion of curative surgery, Demonstrate feasibility of two courses durvalumab (MEDI4736) 750 mg at two weeks interval in neo-adjuvant setting. Feasibility is defined as successful completion of curative surgery within 42 days after start of neo-adjuvant treatment with durvalumab (MEDI4736) (= day 1)., 42 days

The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.

Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., 42 days|Clinical care related_determination of recurrence-free survival, Determine recurrence-free survival by landmarking analysis, based on time since surgery., 42 days|Clinical care related_determination of overall survival, Determine overall survival by landmarking analysis, based on time since surgery., 42 days
This is an interventional study in 20 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer who will receive 2 courses of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in the neo-adjuvant setting, followed by surgery with curative intent.

Experimental imaging procedures include 1) Zr-89-labelled durvalumab (MEDI4736) scan prior to neo-adjuvant treatment to determine accessibility and intra-tumoral distribution of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 2) (first cohort) injection of ex vivo \[111In\]-oxine labelled autologous CD8+ T-cells 48 hours prior to surgery, or (second cohort) injection of \[89Zr\]-Df-crefmirlimab prior to surgery. The scan is scheduled on the day of surgery and after surgery, the resected tumor specimen with ex vivo \[111In\]-oxine labelled or in vivo \[89Zr\]-Df-crefmirlimab labelled CD8+ T-cells in situ, is fixated for high-resolution ex vivo imaging on a preclinical U-SPECT scanner and quantitative histopathological analysis, next to standard histopathological evaluation.

Total duration of the study is maximum 42 days (from injection therapeutic dose durvalumab (MEDI4736) to surgery).
