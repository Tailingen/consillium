A Retrospective Study Reveals the Relationship Between gp42-IgG Epitopes and EBV-associated NPC
Epstein-barr virus (EBV) infection is a necessary factor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The incidence of NPC in endemic regions reaches 24.60/100,000 people, far higher than that of the worldwide average. However, no EBV prophylactic vaccines is clinically available so far, which is largely hampered by the difficulties in selecting optimal vaccine design target out of 13 glycoproteins on the surface of EBV. In this study, we utilized humanized gp42-IgG antibodies to explore the dominant epitopes of gp42, one of the functional EBV glycoproteins during virus entry, to facilitate prophylactic vaccine design.
