Combining Epigenetic And Immune Therapy to Beat Cancer.
Umbrella study structure to independently and simultaneously assess the effects of the association of durvalumab and tazemetostat in multiple solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma|Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma|Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Adult Solid Tumor
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tazemetostat
Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort A, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of disease control rate, defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, Within 6 months of treatment onset|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort B, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of disease control rate, defined as CR, PR and SD as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, Within 6 months of treatment onset|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort C, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of objective response rate, defined as CR and PR as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, Within 6 months of treatment onset|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort D, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-months progression-free rate, defined as CR, PR and SD as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 6 months
Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort D, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of objective response rate, defined as CR and PR as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, Within 6 months of treatment onset|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort A, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-months progression-free rate, defined as CR, PR and SD as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 6 months|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort B, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-months progression-free rate, defined as CR, PR and SD as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 6 months|Assessment of antitumor activity of durvalumab combined with tazemetostat for cohort C, Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of 6-months progression-free rate, defined as CR, PR and SD as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 6 months|6-month objective response (OR) independently for each population, Objective response is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed at 6 months, based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, 6 months|Best overall response, independently for each population, Best overall response is defined as the best response across all time points (RECIST 1.1). The best overall response is determinded once all the data for the patient is known (RECIST 1.1), Throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|1-year progression-free survival, independently for each population, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first, 1 year|1-year overall survival, independently for each population, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (of any cause), 1 year|Safety profile, independently for each population: Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events version 5, Toxicity graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events vers 5, Throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|Tumor immune cell levels, Levels of immune cells in tumors will be measured by immunohistochemistry, before treatment onset, cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 3 day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood cytokines level, Levels of cytokines in blood will be measured by ELISA, before treatment onset, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 3 day 1 and treatment discontinuation (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood lymphocytes level, Levels of lymphocytes in blood will be measured by flow cytometry, before treatment onset, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 3 day 1 and treatment discontinuation (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood kynurenin level, Levels of kynurenin in blood will be measured by ELISA, before treatment onset, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 3 day 1 and treatment discontinuation (each cycle is 21 days)
4 independant, multicenter, prospective, signle-arm phase II trials, based on 2-stage Simon's optimal design, will be conducted in parallel to assess the efficacy of durvalumab when prescribed with tazemetostat, separately, in distinct cohorts of solid tumors:

* cohort A: patients with pancreatic cancer
* cohort B: patients with colorectal cancer not MSI-H or MMR-deficient
* cohort C: patients with metastatic solid tumors with positive interferon gamma signature and/or tertiary lymphoid structure positive
* cohort D: patients with soft-tissue sarcoma
