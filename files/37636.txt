Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Locally Advanced or Metastatic Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage IV locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: methotrexate
Safety and toxic effects of giving docetaxel and methotrexate followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate to the combination of docetaxel and methotrexate followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with stage IV locally advanced or metastatic, previously untreated, transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.
* Assess the toxicities of this sequential regimen in this patient population.
* Assess time to event efficacy measures including time to disease progression, duration of response, and overall survival in these patients treated with this sequential regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8 every 3 weeks for 9 weeks. Patients then receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 9 weeks. This 18 week sequential regimen constitutes 1 full course. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Patients are followed until death or until 2 years after study entry, whichever comes first.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-24 months.
