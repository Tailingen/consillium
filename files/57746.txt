A Phase II Study on Adjuvant Vaccination with Dendritic Cells Loaded with Autologous Tumor Homogenate in Resected Stage IV Rare Cancers.
Single-arm, monocentric trial to assess safety and immunological efficacy of adjuvant vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after curative resection for stage IV rare cancers (In Head/Neck tumors (H\&N), NEuroendocrine Tumors (NET) and Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS).
Head Neck Tumors|Neuroendocrine Tumors|Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Rare Cancer|Vaccination
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous DC vaccine|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence, type and severity of adverse events occurred during treatment will be reported and graded according to NCI CTCAE 5.0 criteria, from the day of the leukapheresis up to 30 days after the last dose|Immunological efficacy, immunological efficacy will be assessed as a proportion of tumor-specific circulating immune effectors determined by IFNgamma ELISPOT, at 4 months, after at least 3 vaccinations
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from registration to the time of death from any cause. Subjects who are alive at the time of the final analysis or who have become lost to follow-up will be censored at their last known alive date., Up to 7 years|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), RFS is the time from registration to the first date of documented progression (or death for any causes). Subject without progression will be censored at their last tumor assessment date., Up to 7 years|Predictive role of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test, Evaluation of the predictive role of a positive DTH test after at least three vaccine administrations, Up to 7 years
This is a single-arm, multi-cohort phase II study, to evaluate the immunological effectiveness and safety of adjuvant Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination. The evaluation of immunological efficacy will be expressed as the number of patients who show enhancement of the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel of associated antigens for each disease (HNSCC, NET and STS). To avoid unacceptable toxicity, a formal safety analysis will be conducted after six patients have been observed (two for each disease) for at least 30 days after the third treatment cycle. If two or more patients have experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, enrollment will be definitively stopped; differently, other 15 patients for each disease will be enrolled and evaluation of primary objectives will be done for each cohort separately (H\&N, STS and NET).
