High Resolution 3D Diffusion-weighted Breast MRI
The purpose of this study is to determine how well a new MRI technique called "High resolution 3D diffusion-weighted breast MRI" detects breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Image Scanner
Sensitivity of the new MRI method, 8 weeks|Lesion detection rate of the new MRI method, 4 weeks
The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a new non-contrast MRI method for breast cancer detection. The study design is a single arm observational study. The new technique will be added on to the standard sequences that a women undergoes during a breast MRI. The resulting images will be compared with her standard breast MRI images, and with results of subsequent pathology.
