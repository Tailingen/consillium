Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of tumor and the primary cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally (1). Approximately two-thirds of these tumors express hormone receptors (HR) and lack HER2 overexpression and/or amplification (2). Throughout treatment, resistance frequently develops, with underlying mechanisms that remain largely undefined (3).
