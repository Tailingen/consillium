A Randomized Trial for Patients With Platinum Resistant Ovarian, Fallopian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer.
This trial compares two chemotherapy agents for the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer in patients that have received and are no longer responding to Platinum based treatment. The purpose of this trial is to compare progression free survival between gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin. Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the period from study entry until disease progression
