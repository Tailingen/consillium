A Clinical Study of Anti-CD70 UCAR-T in Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a single-center, single-arm ，open-label ，dose escalation and dose extension study. In this study we plan to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD70-targeting UCAR-T cells in the treatment of CD70-positive refractory or relapsed solid tumors, and obtain recommended doses and infusion patterns.

Incidence of Adverse events after CD70 UCAR-T cells infusion (Safety and Tolerability), Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 28 days
Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR, SD after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 42 days|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 42 days
In the discovery phase, accelerated titration combined with the "3+3" dose escalation principle was adopted, starting from the initial dose of 3×106/kg. If a grade ≥3 AE occurs during DLT observation, the accelerated titration mode will switch to "3+3" dose escalation, at least 12 eligible patients will be enrolled and receive 4 doses of CD70 UCAR-T cell therapy (3 × 10\^6 cells/kg, 6 × 10\^6 cells/kg, 8× 10\^6 cells/kg, 1 × 10\^7 cells/kg).

In the dose expansion phase, each group will choose one or two dose groups to verify the safety and efficacy, and plan to recruit about 6 subjects in each dose group.

During the clinical study, after the completion of each dose group, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will determine whether it is possible to continue to increase to the next higher dose group, or add more subjects to the current dose group, or reduce to a lower dose group to continue to explore, or climb to a higher dose after reaching the highest dose (1 × 10\^7 cells/kg).
