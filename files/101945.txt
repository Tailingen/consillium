Effect of Mosapride Citrate on Gastrointestinal Motility After Laparoscopic Gastrectomy
"Mosapride citrate is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonist, and is widely used as an agent to increase intestinal motility. Mosapride citrate has been demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies to increase both gastric and colon motility. In a case-control study of patients undergoing colonectomy, mosapride citrate was found to significantly reduce gas passing and defecation time.

Recently, a study reported that mosapride citrate acts on the α7nACh receptor and, consequently, suppresses the inflammatory response of macrophages, thereby suppressing the mechanism that induces paralysis after surgery.

To date, this study is intended to analyze whether mosapride citrate significantly affects the improvement of bowel movement after surgery after gastrectomy."
