Safety and Efficacy of bb2121 (Ide-cel) Combinations in Multiple Myeloma
This is a global, open-label, multi-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK of bb2121 in combination with other therapies in adult subjects with R/RMM.

The following combinations will be

* Arm A will test bb2121 in combination with CC-220 (± low-dose dexamethasone)
* Arm B will test bb2121 in combination with BMS-986405 (JSMD194)

Combination agents being tested may be administered before, concurrently with and/or following (ie, maintenance) bb2121 infusion.

The study will consist of 2 parts: dose finding (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2). Dose expansion may occur in one or more arms.

Incidence of Adverse Event (AEs), An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE., Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of participants who achieved PR or better according to IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma as assessed investigator's review, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from first study treatment (whichever is given earlier) start date to the date of either first observation of progressive disease or death due to any cause, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Overall Survival (OS), Time from first study treatment (whichever is given earlier) start date to death due to any cause, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Time to response (TTR), Time from first study treatment start date to the first date of documented response (PR or better), Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from first documentation of response (PR or better) to first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Time to next antimyeloma treatment (TTNT), Time from first study treatment (whichever is given earlier) start date to first day when participant receives another antimyeloma treatment, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Progression-free survival after next antimyeloma therapy (PFS2), Time from first study treatment (whichever is given earlier) start date to documentation of PD on the next-line treatment or death from any cause, whichever is first., Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Feasibility of maintenance therapy in combination with bb2121, Cumulative incidence of the maintenance therapy starting from bb2121 infusion with death as the competing risk, Up to 4 months after bb2121 infusion in the respective cohort|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax_Phase 1 and 2, Maximum transgene level, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax_Phase 1 and 2, Time to maximum observed transgene level, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Pharmacokinetics - AUC_Phase 1 and 2, Area under the curve of transgene level, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-28days _Phase 1 and 2, Area under the curve of transgene level from time 0 to 28 days, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort|Pharmacokinetics - Tlast _Phase 1 and 2, Time of last measurable transgene level, Up to 24 months after the last participant received any study treatment in the respective cohort
