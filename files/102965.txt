Brazilian Reality in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma - BRA-DLBCL
National, multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective observational study (Real World Evidence-RWE) to analyze the epidemiological profile of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, clinical management, treatment in molecular subgroups, progression profile and patient survival outcomes enrolled and treated within the last 6 years (2017 to 2022), in national cancer reference centers.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
Disease staging, Description of the staging of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma conditions in patients followed in Brazilian reference cancer treatment centers, Time Frame: 6 years (Time of retrospective observational analysis of the study)|Time between diagnosis and start of treatment, Description of the time between diagnosis and start of treatment, Time Frame: 6 years (Time of retrospective observational analysis of the study)|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free Survival will be evaluated as the time from the beginning of treatment, considering each line of treatment, to the objective progression of tumor or death, Time Frame: 6 years (Time of retrospective observational analysis of the study)|Overall Survival, Overall Survival will be evaluated as the time from the diagnosis of the hematological disease at any staging until all-cause death, Time Frame: 6 years (Time of retrospective observational analysis of the study)
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma management is a challenge in clinical setting, as the heterogeneity of conditions due to the molecular complexity of DLBCL may limit treatment response. Other major factor is that in Brazil we lack evidence of treatment response profiling regarding this molecular complexity. To know the epidemiological profile of DLBCL, together with the first-line treatment profile that has been adopted in reference centers, as well as the management of relapsing, is essentially important in generating evidence that add up to actions targeting the improvement of patient care, providing them with better treatments. The Brazilian reality of clinical presentation, management profile, employed treatments and response rate is little known. Considering the Brazilian reality of a continental country, where healthcare services in reference centers present heterogeneous realities, analyzing clinical routine data may generate important evidence (RWE) to comprise the understanding on treatments effectiveness. Generated evidence has the potential to help understanding the reality of Brazilian patients, as well as supporting new regional researches.
