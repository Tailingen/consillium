Efficacy of Metformin as Preventive Treatment in Paclitaxel Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast Cancer Patients
At present, there are no FDA-approved treatments for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Discrete neuro anti-inflammatory effects of metformin support its repurposing as a neuroprotective agent in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of metformin on the amelioration of paclitaxel induced neuropathy in cancer patients.
