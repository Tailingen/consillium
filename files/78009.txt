Effect of Electroacupuncture Combined With Paclitaxel Clinical Efficacy of Patients With Recurrence of High-grade Glioma
Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors, with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy as the main treatment modalities. However, they are highly prone to recurrence, presenting significant treatment challenges, especially for high-grade gliomas, which have a 5-year survival rate of only 5.5%. Paclitaxel, a common chemotherapeutic agent, exhibits antitumor effects in vitro that are 1400 times stronger than those of temozolomide (the first-line chemotherapy drug for gliomas). However, due to its large molecular weight (approximately 893 Da), it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, precluding its use as a first-line treatment for gliomas. Preliminary research by our team has demonstrated that Specific Mode Electroacupuncture Stimulation (SMES) can open the blood-brain barrier, enhancing the concentration of albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABX) in tumor tissues, peritumoral tissues, and surrounding invasive tissues, thereby exerting antitumor effects. Consequently, this study aims to observe the safety and efficacy of SMES combined with ABX in treating patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas postoperatively, to explore its mechanisms of action, extend survival, improve quality of life, and forge new theories and methods for the integrative treatment of brain tumors combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

DRUG: Temozolomide（TMZ） injection or oral administration|DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel(ABX) intravenous drip|DEVICE: Specific mode electroacupuncture stimulation(SMES) intervention
Overall survival（OS）, The duration from randomization to death due to any cause is measured (for patients lost to follow-up, the last follow-up date is used; for patients alive at the end of the study, the date of the last follow-up is considered)., Starting from randomization, during the follow-up phase, telephone follow-ups to record survival status are conducted every two months, totaling six follow-ups. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of patient out
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The period from randomization to the first occurrence of tumor progression or death is meticulously monitored., Up to 12 months were assessed from the date of randomization to the date of first recording to the date of progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first|Head MRI (plain and enhanced), The short-term efficacy of the two groups is analyzed, referencing the RANO criteria for assessing the efficacy of solid tumor treatment before and after therapy. Complete Response (CR) is when visible tumor lesions disappear completely, maintained for \>4 weeks (in accordance with RANO criteria and RECIST version 2000). Partial Response (PR) involves a reduction of ≥50% in the sum of the diameters of the tumor lesions, with no increase in other lesions and no new lesions appearing, maintained for \>4 weeks. Stable Disease (SD) is defined as the sum of the diameters of the tumor lesions decreasing by \<50% or increasing by ≤25%, with no new lesions appearing, maintained for \>4 weeks. Progression (PD) occurs when there is an increase of \>25% in the sum, One treatment cycle is 28 days, with cranial MRI scans conducted one day before the start of treatment cycles 1, 3, and 5, and at the end of treatment cycle 6.|he Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), KPS ranges from 0 to 100, with scores directly correlating to quality of life., One treatment cycle is 28 days, with assessments conducted one day before the start of treatment cycles 1 through 6 and one day before the end of treatment cycle 6.|The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), ECOG Performance Status is scored from 0 to 5, with scores inversely related to quality of life., One treatment cycle is 28 days, with assessments conducted one day before the start of treatment cycles 1 through 6 and one day before the end of treatment cycle 6.|The Quality of Life (QOL), QOL scale for cancer patients assesses quality of life, with a total score ranging from 0 to 60, where scores directly correlate with quality of life., One treatment cycle is 28 days, with assessments conducted one day before the start of treatment cycles 1 through 6 and one day before the end of treatment cycle 6.|The Neurological Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (NANO), NANO Scale quantitatively assesses nine neurological functions in patients, including gait, muscle strength, sensation, visual fields, facial strength, speech, cognition, and limb coordination, with each category scored between 0 to 3 or 0 to 2., One treatment cycle is 28 days, with assessments conducted one day before the start of treatment cycles 1 through 6 and one day before the end of treatment cycle 6.
