Ph. 1, Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, PK, Anti-tumor Activity of STP707 IV in Subjects With Solid Tumors
An open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of STP707 with IV administration in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable solid tumors who are refractory to standard therapy.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: STP707
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended starting dose \& schedule, 28 Day Cycle|Limited Dose Toxicity (LDT), Recommended starting dose \& dose escalation, 28 day cycle
A phase 1, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of STP707 with IV administration in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable solid tumors who are refractory to standard therapy.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the MTD or RP2D of STP707 and to establish the dose of STP707 recommended for future phase 2 studies administered intravenously.

A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled in dose escalation. Once MTD or RP2D has been established, up to 10 additional subjects will enrolled to confirm safety and explore anti-tumor activity.

Up to 5 dose levels will be explored (3,6,12,24,48 mg dose levels). Intermediate doses between scheduled dose levels maybe explored during escalation. A cycle is 28 days.

Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 design.
