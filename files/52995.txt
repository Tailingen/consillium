A Study of MBS314 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
This is a Phase I/Ⅱ, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) and efficacy of a novel asymmetric trivalent tri-specific humanized antibody, MBS314, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This entry-to-human study is divided in 2 parts: a dose escalation part (Phase Ⅰa) and an expansion part (Phase Ⅰb/Ⅱ).
