TEP With 68-DOTANOC in Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC in Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors with comparison with other techniques used in routine clinical practice (octreoscan 速 ; multiphase SPECT / CT, MRI or endoscopy).

Therapeutic impact and safety of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC will also be assessed. Expected results are a confirmation of the superiority of 68Ga-PET DOTANOC versus scintigraphy octreoscan 速, with a potential impact on the therapeutic management of patients.
