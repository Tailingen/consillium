Evaluation of a Novel Auto Segmentation Algorithm for Normal Structure Delineation in Radiation Treatment Planning
This study measures the utility of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for performing auto-segmentation of computed tomography (CT) scans for radiation therapy planning.
Malignant Solid Neoplasm|Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Proportion of success, Will be evaluated by question 1 of the end user survey, which evaluates the level of modification to the artificial intelligence generated auto-segmentation structures that was required (no modification, minor modification, or major modification). Auto-segmentation algorithm data will be collected through an electronic data collection form., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To measure the observed utility of an AI algorithm for normal segmentation by recording study subjects' observations of its function.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Participants complete surveys about the performance/functionality of the auto-segmentation algorithm on study.
