Phase I Newly Diagnosed GBM With Temozolomide, Radiation, and Minocycline Followed by Adjuvant Minocycline/Temozolomide (D-TERMINED)
This will be an open label, single arm study. Subjects with newly diagnosed high grade glioma will begin minocycline one week prior to beginning postoperative chemoradiation and continue it until progression, intolerance, or the end of adjuvant temozolomide, whichever comes first.

DRUG: Minocycline with chemoradiation (temozolomide and radiation therapy)
Safety and tolerability of minocycline combined with standard radiation and chemotherapy, The adverse event rate and maximum tolerated dose of minocycline (up to a maximum dose of 800 mg/day) when combined with concurrent radiation and temozolomide in newly diagnosed high grade glioma is being explored., Patient safety will be evaluated throughout the treatment period (treatment with Temozolomide, Radiation, and Minocycline followed by Adjuvant Minocycline/Temozolomide) which is expected to last about and up to 14 months for each patient
