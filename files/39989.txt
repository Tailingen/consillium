Safety Study of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) to Improve Visibility of Brain Tumors During Surgery
A one time oral dose of ALA is taken before surgery. The medication makes the tumor visible under ultraviolet light which allow the surgeon to see more of the tumor for a more complete removal.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Aminolevulinic Acid
More complete resection of malignant brain tumors, 3-7 days
Safety of drug, 1 month
Patients with primary neoplastic brain tumors (Grades II-IV) will participate in this trial. Each patient will have been evaluated and found to have such a tumor by history and recent imaging studies (MRI) and deemed a surgical candidate based on current neurosurgical standards of care.
