A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Mosunetuzumab + Lenalidomide (+Len), and the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of SC Versus IV Mosunetuzumab + Len in Participants With Follicular Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of mosunetuzumab (Mosun) + lenalidomide (Len) (Mosun + Len) in participants with follicular lymphoma (FL). This study will also compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of IV mosunetuzumab + len vs subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab + len.
