Study Comparing the Efficacy of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Placement With the Addition of Cyanoacrylate Glue Versus PICC Placement Alone in Patients With Cancer.
This is a randomized, prospective, single-center trial comparing the efficacy of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) with the addition of cyanoacrylate glue versus PICC placement alone (without glue) in cancer patients.

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs) are a form of vascular access inserted percutaneously into a vein, usually in the arm, with the distal end at the atrio cava junction (between the superior vena cava and the right atrium). They may be used for a prolonged period or for several days, repeatedly over time (as is the case for certain chemotherapies, parenteral nutrition or long-term intravenous treatments).

Their placement requires aseptic surgical conditions, and a team trained in the procedure, sometimes grouped together in a Vascular Access Unit (UAV).

A PICC is inserted by puncturing the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and securing the catheter with a "Statlock" type stabilizer. The catheter exit point must be covered, at a minimum by a sterile occlusive dressing with a transparent semi-permeable membrane, otherwise referred to as a "transparent dressing".

According to available data, tissue puncture results in bleeding at the puncture site in 25% to 40% of procedures. This bleeding necessitates the application of a sterile compress prior to covering with a transparent dressing. The skin puncture site (also known as the catheter exit point) requires the dressing to be repeated on D1 after insertion.

To sum up:

* If there is no bleeding, there is no need to apply a compress, and the dressing can be changed on D8 after application;
* In the presence of bleeding, a compress is applied and dressing change is mandatory on D1 after application.

PICC placement combined with the use of cyanoacrylate glue would reduce the risk of bleeding, and therefore the need to use of a compress, compared with a standard procedure (without the use of glue).

On this basis, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized, prospective, single-center trial comparing the efficacy of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) with the addition of cyanoacrylate glue versus PICC placement alone (without glue) in patients with cancer.
