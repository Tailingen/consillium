Diagnosis of Gastric Precancerous Lesions by a Blood Test GastroPanel in Patients With Increased Gastric Cancer Risk
Despite the declining incidence, gastric cancer (GC) remains the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In France, it is the second digestive cancer with 7,000 new cases per year. It is now well demonstrated that patients with H. pylori infection, atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, have a high risk of developing GC. It is therefore important to detect these pre-neoplastic lesions at an early stage to improve patients prognosis.

Thus, the aim of this project is to investigate the possible screening of gastric precancerous lesions by a blood test (GastroPanel®) in France, in patients with oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) prescription.

OTHER: blood samples analysis
Sensitivity of GastroPanel blood test, The pepsinogen I (PGI) level measure will be compared with the gold standard method (anatomopathological examination of gastric biopsy). Results will be expressed in accordance with Sydney system. Patients will be classified as ill if PGI\<30µg/l, healthy if PGI \>=30µg/l. The sensitivity of GastroPanel test will be calculated with their 95% confidence interval., One assessment at baseline
