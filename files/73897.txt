DOsimetry and Radiation Induced NAusea in Head and Neck Cancers
This is a prospective cohort study for the analysis of correlation between dosimetric parameters and RANV (Radiation Associated Nausea and Vomiting) in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing exclusive radiotherapy (RT).

The primary purpose of this study is to search for a potential correlation between dosimetry and physician- and patient-rated symptoms in patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

The use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) has become increasingly common in clinical practice for the treatment of head and neck tumors. Despite the well-documented dosimetric advantages of IMRT, there has been a gradual recognition of toxicity profiles that are characteristic and distinct from those known in the era of 2D and 3D techniques, associated with the so-called "dose bath" typical of all intensity-modulated treatments. Among these, one of the main concerns is Radiation-Associated Nausea and Vomiting (RANV), the persistence and severity of which can significantly compromise the quality of life for patients.

Consequently, there has been a growing need to more thoroughly assess the clinical and dosimetric risk factors associated with the onset of RANV in this population. Although several authors have already investigated this aspect, most studies available to date consider cases where concurrent chemotherapy administration may affect the assessment of the outcomes of interest. Even when exclusively focusing on studies centered on IMRT (without concurrent chemotherapy), the generalization of results is at least partially affected by the fact that these are retrospective series with a relatively small population (23-130 patients).
