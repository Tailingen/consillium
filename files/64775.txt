Study of EGF816 in Combination With Selected Targeted Agents in EGFR-mutant NSCLC
The study purpose is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the addition of INC280, trametinib, ribociclib, gefitinib, or LXH254 to EGF816 in adult patients with advanced Epidermal growth factor receptor- mutant (EGFR-mutant) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Number of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events, Assess safety and tolerability including incidence of dose limiting toxicities, adverse events, and serious adverse events., Every day until study end, approximately 4 years|Number of participants with DLTs in the first cycle of combination (Dose escalation only), A Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade â‰¥ 3 assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 28 days of combination treatment during the dose escalation part of the study. Other clinically significant toxicities may be considered to be DLTs, even if not CTCAE grade 3 or higher., 28 days|Number of participants with dose interruptions and reductions, Assessment of tolerability. For patients who do not tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments may be permitted in order to allow patients to continue the study treatment., From first dose until study ends, approximately 4 years|Dose intensity of study drugs, Dose intensity is computed as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received to actual duration of exposure., From first dose until study ends, approximately 4 years|ORR2, Modified objective response rate (ORR2) per RECIST v1.1 (taking as baseline the most recent assessment prior to initiating combination), Every 8-12 weeks until study ends, approximately 4 years

This is a Phase Ib, open label, non-randomized dose escalation study of EGF816 in combination with ribociclib, trametinib, or LXH254, followed by dose expansion of EGF816 in combination with ribociclib, trametinib, LXH254, INC280, or gefitinib in adult patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

During the dose escalation part, patients were assigned to the addition of trametinib, ribociclib, or LXH254 to EGF816.

Following determination of the recommended dose for the combination of EGF816 + trametinib, EGF816 + ribociclib, and EGF816 + LXH254, patients could be enrolled to the dose expansion arms of each of these combinations. Patients could also be assigned to EGF816 + INC280. The planned arm EGF816 + gefitinib in dose expansion was not opened for enrollment.
