Safety and Tolerability Study of Mivebresib Tablet Alone or in Combination With Ruxolitinib Tablet or Navitoclax Tablet in Adult Participants With Myelofibrosis
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a bone marrow illness that affects blood-forming tissues in the body. MF disturbs the body's normal production of blood cells, causing extensive scarring in the bone marrow. This leads to severe anemia, weakness, fatigue, and an enlarged spleen. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable mivebresib is, when given alone, and in combination with navitoclax or ruxolitinib, for adult participants with MF.

Mivebresib is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MF. The study has 4 segments - A, B, C, and D. In Segment A, the safe dosing regimen of mivebresib is identified, and then given alone as monotherapy. In Segment B, C, and D, combination therapies of mivebresib with either ruxolitinib or navitoclax are given. Adult participants with a diagnosis of MF will be enrolled. Around 130 participants will be enrolled in 60 sites worldwide.

In Segment A, participants will receive different doses and schedules of oral mivebresib tablet to identify a safe dosing regimen. Additional participants will be enrolled at the identified monotherapy dosing regimen. In Segment B, participants will receive oral ruxolitinib and mivebresib will be given as "add-on" therapy. In Segment C, participants will receive mivebresib and oral navitoclax. In Segment D, participants will receive mivebresib and ruxolitinib. Participants will receive treatment until disease progression or the participants are not able to tolerate the study drugs.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.
Myelofibrosis (MF)
DRUG: Mivebresib|DRUG: Navitoclax|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug., Up To Approximately 1 year from start of study
Percentage of Participants who Achieve Spleen Volume Reduction of 35% or Greater (SVR35), Reduction in spleen volume is measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Up To Week 24|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Mivebresib, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of Mivebresib., Up To Week 12|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of Mivebresib, The amount of time taken to reach Cmax., Up To Week 12|Area Under Concentration vs Time Curve (AUC) of Mivebresib, AUC of Mivebresib will be calculated., Up To Week 12|Half-Life (t1/2) of Mivebresib, Half-life of Mivebresib will be calculated., Up To Week 12|Accumulation Ratio of Mivebresib, Pharmacokinetic parameters will include accumulation ratio of Mivebresib., Up To Week 12|Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of Mivebresib, CL/F of Mivebresib will be calculated., Up To Week 12|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vd/F) of Mivebresib, Vd/F of mivebresib will be calculated., Up To Week 12|Percentage of Participants With >= 50% Reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS), TSS is assessed using the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) v4.0. MFSAF v4.0 measures the burden of myelofibrosis-related symptoms. The symptoms are assessed on a 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) anchored from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable)., Week 24|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the sum of rates of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)., Week 24|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Navitoclax, Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of Navitoclax., Up To Week 12|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of Navitoclax, The amount of time taken to reach Cmax., Up To Week 12|Area Under Concentration vs Time Curve (AUC) of Navitoclax, AUC of Navitoclax will be calculated., Up To Week 12|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Ruxolitinib, Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of Ruxolitinib., Up To Week 12|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of Ruxolitinib, The amount of time taken to reach Cmax., Up To Week 12|Area Under Concentration vs Time Curve (AUC) of Ruxolitinib, AUC of Ruxolitinib will be calculated., Up To Week 12
