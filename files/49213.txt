Profiling Program of Advanced/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients
The proposal is to implement a molecular screening program for advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer patients before the initiation of 1st line treatment in order to allow a better selection of patients for rationale personalized medicine with targeted agents and/or combination involving a chemotherapy backbone.
