A Study of GDC-0084 in Patients With Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
This open-label, multicenter, Phase I, dose-escalating study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of GDC-0084 in patients with progressive or recurrent high-grade glioma. Stage 1 is the dose escalation part of the study. Stage 2, patients will receive GDC-0084 at a recommended dose for future studies.
