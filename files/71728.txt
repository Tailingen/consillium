Diet, Physical Activity and Body Composition Changes During R-CHOP
In this pilot study, observational data will be collected to describe the usual trajectory of changes in dietary intake, ability to be physically active, body composition, environmental exposures, and the gut microbiome over the course of R-CHOP treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) is the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, yet it is estimated that R-CHOP is not curative for 30- 50% of patients. Preliminary studies suggests that modifiable lifestyle factors such as body composition, exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, and changes in the gut microbiome may contribute to variation in R-CHOP treatment response. If true, it could be possible to modify these factors in an effort to improve treatment outcomes, however more detailed information is needed to confirm these preliminary findings and test whether lifestyle modification can improve outcomes.

In this observational study, data will be collected on dietary intake, ability to be physically active, body composition, environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and changes in the gut microbiome over the course of R-CHOP for NHL. The study will provide more detailed information on the usual trajectory of these lifestyle factors during R-CHOP treatment than has previously been collected, especially how these factors co-vary over time. The study findings are expected to inform future intervention studies aimed at improving R-CHOP treatment outcomes.
