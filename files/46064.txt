Intensive Nutrition Counselling in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a pre-planned patient-adjusted intensive nutritional counselling given by a dietitian several times during (chemo)radiotherapy vs. individualized nutritional counselling given by a dietitian once in the beginning of (chemo)radiotherapy and thereafter on-demand in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Nutritional counselling
Nutritional status, Nutritional status was assessed by patient-generated subjective global assessment and anthropometry., 6 months
Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time interval between the date of the randomization (i.e. at diagnosis) and the date of the last visit or death by any cause., 5 year
* A sample size of 102 patients was identified to achieve 30% reduction in prevalence of malnutrition at the end of treatment (50% to 20%), with a significance value of 5% (p \< 0.05), 90% power. The second calculation was for a sample size of 88 patients for 30% reduction in prevalence of malnutrition at the end of treatment (50% to 20%) with the significance value 5% (p\<0.05), 85% power and effect size 70%. Based on these numbers, our aim is to recruit 100 patients, with the assumption that 12% patients would be lost to follow up.
* Randomization will be performed by the minimization procedure with the Minim ProgramÂ® (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/\~mb55/guide/randsery.htm). The allocation will be done according to the following criteria: 1) Stage I-II vs. Stage III-IV; 2) age \<65 vs. \>=65 year; 3) Body Mass Index \<20 vs. \>=20 kg/m2 and 4) tumour location (oral cavity-oropharynx-tonsils vs. hypopharynx-larynx vs. nasopharynx).
* Adverse events of chemoradiotherapy will be classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-3.0 (CTCAE v3.0)
* Nutritional status will be assessed by patient-generated subjective global assessment, nutritional risk screening-2002, upper-arm anthropometry (MAC, triceps skinfold thickness, MAMA), Bio-impedance, hand grip strength and weight loss.
* Survival: overall survival, disease-specific survival and disease-free survival are calculated.
