Efficacy and Safety of Dronabinol in the Improvement of Chemotherapy-induced and Tumor-related Symptoms in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
Aim of this phase III trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dronabinol (orally administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) as adjuvant therapy to first-line standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer for improvement of chemotherapy- and tumor-related symptoms applicated by individual titration up to the maximum tolerated dose.

Standardized area under the curve of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 symptom summary score over the on-treatment period., The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is an integrated system for assessing the health-related quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials.

The validated QLQ-C30 summary score is calculated as mean score of the 13 of the 15 EORTC QLQ-C30 scales (v3.0), based on 27 of 30 items (the Financial Impact scale and Quality of Life score are not included). A high score for a symptom scale / item (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea) represents a high level of symptomatology / problems. A high score for a functional scale (physical functioning, role functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning) represents a high / healthy level of functioning. Scores for individual items: "Not at All" = 1 point, "A Little" = 2 points, "Quite a Bit" = 3 points, "Very Much" = 4 points.

A linear transformation is used to standardize the raw score, so that overall scores range from 0 to 100., Prior to treatment start until end of 16 weeks maintenance treatment

This marker is fast becoming recognised as a global health marker in total body health assessment. A higher Phase Angle could mean an increase in muscle mass (body cell mass) or a decrease in fluid, either from recovery from infection or injury (a good thing!) or a decrease in fluid from dehydration (a bad thing!). A loss of fat could also increase Phase Angle.

A lower Phase Angle could mean a loss of muscle mass (a bad thing), or an increase of fluid (rehydrating which is a good thing, or sign of inflammation or infection - a bad thing), or gaining fat (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your state of health).

Patients with pancreatic cancer suffer from multiple symptoms related to the tumor itself or induced by the chemotherapy. The available supportive therapy is still not able to relief all symptoms that are caused by the malignancy itself as well as by the antineoplastic therapy.

Additionally, anorexia and weight loss, that often result in increased morbidity and mortality in this patient population as well as in psycho-social burden and suffering in patients and their relatives, are unmet needs in pancreatic cancer patients.

Therapeutic approaches focus on treating the malignancy itself, additional nutritional support and physical examination might prevent patients from further side effects such as sarcopenia.

During the last decades a number of appetite-modulating drugs have been under clinical investigation. A number of studies focused on the endocannabinoid system, which is involved amongst others in appetite-modulating, antiemetic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory processes.

As dronabinol is already used as magistral formulation, its beneficial effect has often been observed in these patients in the clinical routine, especially in patients with therapy-refractory nausea and emesis. Due to its broad efficacy it might be of benefit for patients suffering from malignancy. Thus, investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of dronabinol in the improvement of chemotherapy-induced and tumor-related symptoms in advanced pancreatic patients during systemic first-line chemotherapy. However, data on optimal dosage are conflicting yet.

In detail, investigators want to study whether dronabinol has a positive influence on quality of life and whether symptoms caused by the tumor or by the chemotherapy itself might be palliated by dronabinol. Beneficial and potential harmful side effects and the personal perception of advanced pancreatic cancer patients will be documented.
