Study of ABT-263 When Administered in Combination With Either Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/Rituximab or Bendamustine/Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety of ABT-263 administered in combination with either FCR or BR in subjects with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: ABT-263|DRUG: FCR|DRUG: BR
Assess the safety profile, characterize pharmacokinetics, and determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABT-263 when administered in combination with either FCR or BR in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL., Safety assessments = 1 wk, Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sampling = 1 wk for 1st 2 cycles, then, every other cycle starting Cycle 3 to Cycle 9, Determination of MTD & RPTD = Every 60 days
Evaluate preliminary data regarding progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response rate and overall survival (OS) when ABT-263 is administered in combination with either FCR or BR., Tumor assessments, Every 2 months
