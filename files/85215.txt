Observational Study of Nivolumab Monotherapy or in Combination With Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma and in Participants With Adjuvant Nivolumab Therapy
The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab treatment, either in monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab, overall and according to various subgroups of interest, in participants with advanced melanoma and in participants with adjuvant nivolumab therapy.
