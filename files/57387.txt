Tazemetostat in Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
This phase 2, open label, single arm study will investigate the use of tazemetostat in patients with recurrent/refractory and/or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor
DRUG: Tazemetostat
Objective response rate, Assess the objective response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve either a complete response or partial response based on radiographic evaluation of treatment response via RECIST1.1, 2 years
Progression free survival, Determine the progression free survival, defined as the length of time from the start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., 3 years|Time to progression, Determine the time to progression, defined as the length of time from the start of treatment until disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria., 2 years|Clinical benefit, Determine the clinical benefit using the Numbered Pain Rating Scale. A person rates their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 or 0 to 5. Zero means "no pain," and 5 or 10 means "the worst possible pain." These pain intensity levels may be assessed upon initial treatment, or periodically after treatment., 2 years|Clinical benefit rate, Assess the clinical benefit rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with complete or partial response or stable disease (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) lasting at least 4 months., 2 years
