Safety Study of XL147 (SAR245408), in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Adults With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL147 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in adults with solid tumors. XL147 is a new chemical entity that inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells. In clinical practice, the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is an accepted treatment regimen for various solid tumors, including ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
