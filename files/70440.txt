Evaluation of Approved Weight-Based Dose Compared to Fixed Dose of Plerixafor in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Weighing Less Than 70 Kilograms
The purpose of this study was to compare the responses of 2 different doses of plerixafor in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who received an autologous stem cell transplant.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)|DRUG: Fixed Dose Plerixafor|DRUG: Weight-Based Plerixafor
Proportion of Patients Who Achieved at Least 5*10^6 Cluster of Differentiation 34+ (CD34+) Cells Per Kilogram (Cells/kg), The cumulative number of CD34+ cells/kg (body weight) collected over all apheresis sessions (up to a maximum of 4 sessions) was used to determine if a patient has achieved the target of \>=5\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg (optimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation) within 4 days of apheresis. The proportion of patients who achieved the target was reported as percentages for each treatment arm., Day 5 up to Day 8|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 10 Hours (AUC [0-10]), 0 (pre-plerixafor dose), 0.5, 1, 4 hours post-plerixafor dose on Day 4; 9-10 hours post-plerixafor dose (pre G-CSF dose) on Day 5, 10-11 hours post-plerixafor dose (prior to first apheresis) on Day 5
Proportion of Patients Who Achieved at Least 2*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg in Less Than or Equal to 4 Days of Apheresis, The cumulative number of CD34+ cells/kg (body weight) collected over all apheresis sessions (up to a maximum of 4 sessions) was used to determine if a patient has achieved the target of \>= 2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg (minimum number of CD34+ cells required for transplantation) within 4 days of apheresis. The proportion of patients who achieved the target was reported as percentages for each treatment arm., Day 5 up to Day 8|Median Number of Days of Apheresis to Collect at Least 2*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg, Day 5 up to Day 8|Median Number of Days of Apheresis to Collect at Least 5*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg, Day 5 up to Day 8|Total Number of CD34+ Cells/kg Collected Over up to 4 Aphereses, The cumulative number of CD34+ cells/kg (body weight) collected over all apheresis sessions (up to a maximum of 4 sessions) was reported., Day 5 up to Day 8|Mean Fold Increase in Peripheral Blood CD34+ Cell Count Following Plerixafor, Fold increase was calculated as CD34+ cell count on Day 5 divided by CD34+ cell count on Day 4., Baseline (pre G-CSF dose on Day 4) to Day 5 (prior to first apheresis)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 0 (pre-plerixafor dose), 0.5, 1, 4 hours post-plerixafor dose on Day 4; 9-10 hours post-plerixafor dose (pre G-CSF dose) on Day 5, 10-11 hours post-plerixafor dose (prior to first apheresis) on Day 5|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), 0 (pre-plerixafor dose), 0.5, 1, 4 hours post-plerixafor dose on Day 4; 9-10 hours post-plerixafor dose (pre G-CSF dose) on Day 5, 10-11 hours post-plerixafor dose (prior to first apheresis) on Day 5|Terminal Elimination Half-life (T1/2), T1/2 is the time required for the plasma concentration to decrease to one half., 0 (pre-plerixafor dose), 0.5, 1, 4 hours post-plerixafor dose on Day 4; 9-10 hours post-plerixafor dose (pre G-CSF dose) on Day 5, 10-11 hours post-plerixafor dose (prior to first apheresis) on Day 5
