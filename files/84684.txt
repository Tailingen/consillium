Investigation of the Effect of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Intervention in Oncology Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Based Intervention for Oncology Patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the Acceptance and Commitment to Therapy-Based Intervention for Oncology Patients affect the level of psychological distress?
* Does the Acceptance and Commitment to Therapy-Based Intervention for Oncology Patients affect the level of reintegration into normal life?

Researchers will compare Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Intervention for Oncology Patients (ACT) to Psychoeducation for Oncology Patients and routine care (with no specific intervention) to see if Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Intervention for Oncology Patients is effective in psychological distress and reintegration into normal living.

The Distress Thermometer (DT), The scale was developed to measure psychological distress in cancer patients. The problems in the list are grouped into five areas. These are daily life problems, family problems, emotional problems, faith-related problems, and physical problems. The patient marks which one or which areas of the list he/she has experienced problems in the last week. The cut-off point of the scale in our country was found to be 4. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) argues that patients who score 5 or above on the distress thermometer are in significant distress and should be supported by professionals., 1 day before intervention start|The Distress Thermometer (DT), The scale was developed to measure psychological distress in cancer patients.

Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI), The Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) has two sub-dimensions. These are: daily functions and self-perceptions. The scale is scored on a five-point Likert scale: Strongly Disagree (1 point), Disagree (2 points), Undecided (3 points), Agree (4 points) and Strongly Agree (5 points). Scores that can be obtained from the scale vary between 11 and 55. A high score on the scale indicates a better level of participation in normal life., 1 day before intervention start|Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI), The Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) has two sub-dimensions.

Participants:

* They will be randomly divided into three groups (Group 1: ACT, Group 2: Psychoeducation, Group 3: Routine care).
* All participants will be asked to complete data collection forms.
* Group 1 will participate in a 5-session Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Intervention for Oncology Patients intervention program.
* Group 2 will participate in a 5-session Psychoeducation for Oncology Patients program.
* During this period, participants in group 3 will continue their routine treatment.
* After completion of the interventions, participants will be asked to complete the data collection forms again.
* The researchers will then analyze the results and write the report.
