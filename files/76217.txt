Use Misoprostol to Optimize Prevention of Cervical Cancer
This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 420 non-pregnant women undergoing cancer screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) who have Type 3 transformation zone (TZ) and randomized to receive either Misoprostol or placebo.
Cervical Cancers
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Misoprostol
Conversion rate from Type 3 transformation zone (TZ) to Types 1 or 2, The rate of participants with successful transformation from Type 3 (TZ) to Type 1 or 2 (TZ) will be calculated. It is the number of participants who successfully transformed from Type 3 TZ to Type 1 or 2 TZ, divided by the total number of participants in the entire randomized cohort., Approximately 2-3 hours and approximately 4-6 hours since drug administration
Comparison of the rate of patients converted from Type 3 TZ to Type 1 or 2 TZ between 2-3 hours and 4-6 hours, The rate of transformation from Type 3 transformation zone (TZ) to Type 1 or 2 TZ between 2-3 hours and 4-6 hours after administering misoprostol will be compared. The rate is calculated as the number of successful transformations within each time period (2-3 hours or 4-6 hours) divided by the total cohort., Approximately 2-3 hours vs approximately 4-6 hours
This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 420 non-pregnant women undergoing cancer screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) who have Type 3 transformation zone (TZ) and randomized to receive either Misoprostol or placebo.
