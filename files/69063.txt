A Study of LY3127804 With Ramucirumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3127804 given as monotherapy and in combination with Ramucirumab for participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will also include a safety exploration for the combination of LY3127804 plus ramucirumab and paclitaxel
