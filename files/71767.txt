A Study to Evaluate Rucaparib in Participants With Solid Tumors and With Deleterious Mutations in HRR Genes
A Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial to evaluate the response of rucaparib in participants with various solid tumors and with deleterious mutations in Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) genes.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Rucaparib
Best Overall Response Rate by Investigator, Best overall response rate as assessed by the investigator by RECIST v1.1 (or by RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 in participants with advanced prostate cancer)., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)
Overall Response Rate by Independent Radiology Review, Best overall response rate by independent radiology review by RECIST v1.1 (or by RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 in participants with advanced prostate cancer)., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of Response, Measure of clinical benefit, defined as the time from initial tumor response to documented tumor progression., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Disease Control Rate, Measure of clinical benefit, defined as the percentage of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) beyond 16 weeks., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Progression-free Survival, Measure of clinical benefit, defined as the duration from study enrollment to objective tumor progression. Progression was defined using RECIST v1.1, as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm), or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions. For mCRPC disease, the PCWG3 confirmed bone disease progression criteria (2+2) were also incorporated., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall Survival, Measure of clinical benefit, defined as the duration from study enrollment to death., From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)|Steady State Minimum Concentration [Cmin], Rucaparib pharmacokinetics, From first dose of study drug until disease progression (up to approximately 2 years)
A Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial to evaluate the response of rucaparib in participants with various solid tumors and with deleterious mutations in Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) genes.
