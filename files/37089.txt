RP72 Monotherapy and in Combination With Gemcitabine in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This is a Phase I, multi center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RP72 as monotherapy and RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer.

The study has two arms:

Arm A: RP72 monotherapy

Arm B: RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine

Both treatment arms will follow a standard 3+3 design. Up to 48 adult patients with pancreatic cancer will be enrolled in this study.
Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable|Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: RP72|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase II of RP72 monotherapy and RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine, The MTD is defined as 1 dose level (cohort) below the dose in which dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in â‰¥ 33% of the participants., Over the 28 day treatment period
RP72 (Rise Prot-72) is a small molecular weight protein which directly binds to CXCR1 and CXCR2, which are the receptors of CXCL8 \[Interleukin 8 (IL-8) or chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8\] and ELR-CXC chemokine. Therefore, RP72 can inhibit the binding of CXCL8 to its receptors CXCR1/2 and further block CXCL8-mediated signal transduction. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that RP72 binds to the receptors of CXCL8 and blocks activation of CXCL8-mediated signaling transduction pathways, which decreases proliferation of susceptible tumor cells, especially the pancreatic cancer cells.

In this Phase I study, RP-72 will be used as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in adult patients with pancreatic cancer. The study aims to to evaluate the safety and efficacy, and to determine the MTD and recommended Phase II dose of RP72 monotherapy and RP72 in combination with Gemcitabine in patients with Pancreatic Cancer.
