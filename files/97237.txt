The Effect of Carboxymetyl Starch (Oozfix) on Preventing Postoperative Complication After Gastrectomy
Although the technique of radical gastrectomy had been advanced, postoperative complication can occur in 13\~25% of patient after radical gastrectomy. Pancreatic fistula and postoperative bleeding was reported as 2\~30% and 1\~2%, respectively. These complications often result fatal clinical course, so localized fibrin agent has been widely used at postoperative surgical bed after radical gastrectomy.

Recently, natural origin polysaccharide-based carboxymetyl starch was approved as localized coagulative, no well-designed report was adressed in gastric cancer surgery field. This agent can formate physical barrier after application, thus can prevent microbleeding or pancreatic fistula after gastrectomy. THIS study is single-center, non-inferiority, open-label randomized trial that evaluates the effect of carboxymetyl starch (Oozfix) on preventing postoperative complication after gastrectomy.
