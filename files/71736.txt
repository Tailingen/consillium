"Effectiveness of Community Health Workers in Breast Cancer Prevention in Jumla: a Cluster Randomized Trials
Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among Nepali females, accounting for 17.1% of cases and 7.7% of female cancer-related deaths. It is more common in younger, premenopausal women, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Raising awareness through community education is crucial for promoting breast cancer screening, particularly in low-resource settings like Nepal, where clinical breast exams are essential early detection tools. Integrating breast cancer education into the health system can enhance knowledge, encourage screening, and promote healthy behaviors for prevention. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates.

In remote areas, limited access to advanced detection technologies makes breast self-examination (BSE) the most feasible and cost-effective method, particularly in Jumla. This study evaluates the effectiveness of community health worker-led breast cancer prevention through health promotion and education strategies. It follows PROCTOR's framework and the Health Belief Model (HBM) A mixed-methods design will be employed, incorporating an embedded implementation science approach, a cluster-randomized trial, and mixed-method research. The study population includes married women of Jumla, female community health volunteers (FCHVs), and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs). Exclusion criteria include married women ≥20 years old with existing cases of cancer, pregnant or lactating women, FCHVs unable to acquire BSE skills, and untrained ANMs. The sample consists of 90 participants in both intervention and control groups.

Acceptability, Appropriateness, and Feasibility will be assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) tool. SOP-based checklists will evaluate fidelity, while FGDs and KIIs will collect qualitative data. Quantitative data will be analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. A paired t-test and mixed-effect linear regression will assess effectiveness, while qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis. Findings will be reported per CONSORT guidelines.

Ethical approval will be obtained from the Nepal Health Research Council. Expected outcomes include improved breast cancer knowledge, perception, and screening intention, leading to early detection and reduced prevalence. However, selection bias in cluster trials may limit generalizability.

BEHAVIORAL: Implementation strategy - Health Promotion and Education-based intervention
The implementation outcome will be measured by: Acceptability (attitude and perception of women toward BSE and satisfaction levels of the individuals who perform BSE)., Acceptability (attitude and perception of women toward BSE and satisfaction levels of the individuals who perform BSE). The following indicators will measure this: participants' attitudes toward BSE, perception scores measured in the mean score and SD, and the percentage of women satisfied with BSE practices., From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention|Adoption, Adoption will be measured by the percentage of CHW and FCHVs willing to adopt BSE. It will also be measured by the extent to which FCHVs are eager and able to integrate BSE activities into their existing roles and responsibilities., From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention|Appropriateness, Appropriateness will be measured using indicators of the extent to which CNMP is suitably suited to the cultural, social, and economic context and aligned with the needs and preferences of the target population., From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention|Feasibility of implementing FCHV induced breast-self examination, Feasibility will be measured by assessing the practicality and ease of implementing FCHV in CNMP, quantified through the percentage of health facilities equipped with necessary resources, including training materials and equipment, as well as the proportion of FCHV implementation strategies successfully adopted, From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention|Fidelity, Fidelity will be measured by evaluating the extent to which FCHVs and HFs adhere to the prescribed guidelines and protocols for BSE screening and referral, monitoring the consistency of FCHV discussed in the HMG meeting across different communities, and evaluating the extent to which women adhere to the prescribed guidelines for BSE., From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention|Effectiveness, Effectiveness outcomes will be measured using the following indicators: Perception, attitude, knowledge, coverage of BSE screening, and Follow-up rates for positive cases., From date of randomization, baseline data collection within 2 weeks, and endline 2 months after intervention
