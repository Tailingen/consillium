The Clinical, Epidemiological and Treatment Characteristics of Head and Neck Cancer Patients
The aim of our study is to prospectively collect information regarding (1) the demographic, lifestyle-related and clinical characteristics of patients with head and neck cancer and (2) the waiting times to diagnosis and therapy, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival of patients. We plan to gain insight into the characteristics and pathways of head and neck cancer patients in Baranya County, which can in turn help to identify factors that lead to improved or worse disease outcomes. (Thus, these factors can subsequently eliminated or lessened to improve the outcome of head and neck cancer patients. )

The aim of our study is to prospectively collect information regarding (1) the demographic, lifestyle-related and clinical characteristics of patients (including initial symptoms) with head and neck cancer and (2) the patient pathways and waiting times to diagnosis and therapy, the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival, and time to metastasis of patients.

Study design:

Prospective data collection and analysis, based on data collected from the clinic's electronic eMedSol database and questionnaire (regarding demographic, lifestyle and patient pathway-related data) filled in by interviewing patient.

We plan to monitor lifestyle parameters of patients (such as oral hygiene, alcohol consumption and smoking, the knowledge of patients about risk factors of head and neck cancers,etc) and clinical parameters such as time and type of first symptom, ECOG state, comorbidities, clinical stage, diagnostic workups, etc. at predetermined time intervals (upon first ENT presentation, and at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24 month intervals.

Disease progression (time to metastasis) and overall survival will be assessed at the given time points.

By gathering data and gaining insight into the characteristics, pathways and survival of head and neck cancer patients we aim to identify factors that may lead to improved or worse disease outcomes.
