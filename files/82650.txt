Safety and Activity Study of PSCA-Targeted CAR-T Cells (BPX-601) in Subjects With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of BPX-601 CAR-T cells in participants with previously treated advanced solid tumors (prostate) expressing high levels of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). Participants' T cells are modified to recognize and target the PSCA tumor marker on cancer cells.

BIOLOGICAL: BPX-601|DRUG: Rimiducid
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Incidence of dose limiting toxicity, 4 weeks after first rimiducid infusion (i.e., Day 35)|Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) assessed for severity using NCI CTCAE v4.03, 180 days after BPX-601 treatment up to 15 years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Identify the optimal dose of BPX-601 with rimiducid for Phase 2, through Phase 1 completion, up to 5 years
Pharmacodynamics (PD) of BPX-601, Change from baseline in pharmacodynamic blood biomarkers - markers of BPX-601 CAR-T cells, up to 1 year after treatment|Antitumor activity of BPX-601, Percentage of subjects with objective response determined by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, From the time of BPX-601 cell infusion until confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause, the start of new anticancer therapy, or withdrawal, whichever comes first, as assessed for up to 5 years after the last subject has been enrolled
The goal of this study is to characterize the feasibility, safety, and clinical activity of PSCA-specific CAR-T cells, BPX-601, administered with rimiducid to subjects with previously treated, PSCA-positive advanced solid tumors (prostate). BPX-601 CAR-T cells are genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to target the PSCA antigen and a rimiducid-inducible signaling domain which functions as a molecular "go-switch" to enhance activation and proliferation.

Phase 1: Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-601 administered with single or repeat doses of rimiducid.

Phase 2: Indication-specific dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including BPX-601 persistence), and clinical activity at the recommended dose identified in Phase 1 in various PSCA-expressing solid tumors.
