A Phase II Trial of Upfront Radiotherapy Plus Almonertinib for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR)-Mutant Non-small-cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC) Patients With Brain Metastases
Almonertinib is a three-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), which has shown competitive potential in the second-line treatment against first-generation TKIs. This study intends to assess the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery with sequential almonertinib in treatment-naive EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
