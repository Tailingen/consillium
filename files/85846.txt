Role of Renal Biopsy in the Suspicion of Nephrotoxicity of Immunotherapy (Checkpoint Inhibitors) in Solid Cancer
Checkpoint inhibitors represent a new class of widely used immunotherapy, however with immune-mediated adverse effects, with renal damage estimated at 1.4% and 4.9% depending on the series.

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATNI) represents the most common type of damage, although there are other types of damage, associated or not with NTIA.

We aim to establish a probability score for the presence of histological NTIA lesions in a patient treated with CPI who presents with acute renal failure in order to guide the nephrologist and oncologist in their management in the event of AKI at the CPI, and determine the usefulness of a PBR to guide the suspension/resumption of immunotherapy +/- associated corticosteroid therapy; avoiding a PBR exposing to a high iatrogenic risk and sometimes impossible.
