Natural Killer Cell (CYNK-001) Infusions in Adults With Multiple Myeloma
This study will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CYNK-001 which contain NK cells derived from human placental CD34+ cells and culture-expanded. CYNK-001 cells will be given post Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT). The safety of this treatment will be evaluated, and researchers will want to learn if NK cells will help in treating Multiple Myeloma.
