NovellusDx Cancer Early Detection Blood Test- Clinical Trial
NovellusDx early detection test is a simple to perform blood test, which identifies the deregulated signaling pathways within the patient tumor based on protein secretion to the blood, thus enabling early stage disease signature detection. The investigators' current clinical trial is focused on proving the main feature of NovellusDx's Early Detection Test- discriminating between cancer patients and healthy subjects.
