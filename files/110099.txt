Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Inoperable Thyroid Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with metastatic or inoperable thyroid cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
Response Rate, To determine the response rate of this regimen of irinotecan in patients with metastatic MTC, Every 2 cycles
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or inoperable locoregional medullary thyroid cancer treated with irinotecan.

Secondary

* Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response is assessed after completion of 4 courses. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR. Patients who have stable disease receive up to 12 total courses.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
