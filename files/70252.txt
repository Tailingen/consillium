A Clinical Trial on Combined (Neo-)Adjuvant Intravenous Plus Intracranial Administration of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Recurrent Glioblastoma
The goal of this phase I interventional study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the proposed investigational (neo-)adjuvant treatment regimen in patients with resectable reccurent glioblastoma.

Participants will:

* receive neo-adjuvant administration of intravenous immunotherapy
* followed by a maximal safe neurosurgical resection
* afterwards, immunotherapy will be injected into the brain tissue
* followed by insertion of an Ommaya reservoir
* postoperatively, administration of immunotherapy will be continued
Recurrent Glioblastoma
DRUG: Neo-adjuvant nivolumab and ipililumab IV + adjuvant nivolumab and ipililumab IV|PROCEDURE: Neurosurgery and intracavitary injection nivolumab and ipililumab|DRUG: Adjuvant nivolumab IV + nivolumab and ipililumab intracavitary
Determine the safety and feasibility of the proposed investigational (neo-)adjuvant treatment regimen in patients with resectable recurrent glioblastoma., Incidence of treatment related adverse events (TRAE). TRAE will be collected on a continuous basis. Type, frequency and severity (graded according to the CTCAEv5) will be reported descriptively., 1 year
Estimate anti-tumor responses of the proposed investigational (neo-)adjuvant treatment regimen., Objective response rate (ORR, according to iRANO criteria) following 4 weeks of neo-adjuvant therapy., 4 years
Estimate progression-free and overall survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates., PFS and OS estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (incl. median, 6-months-, and yearly survival rates with 95% CI)., 4 years
