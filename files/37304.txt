Response Adapted Therapy With Bortezomib/Dexamethasone Followed by Addition of Lenalidomide in Non Responders as Initial Treatment for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to see if researchers could get the same good results with less toxicity by using this new approach.

We already know that the three drugs bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone given together at the same time are effective. Most physicians therefore treat patients with multiple myeloma with the 3 drug combination. However, the researchers also know that the three drugs given together result in more side effects than when only 2 drugs (bortezomib and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone) are given. The researchers believe that all patients may not necessarily need the three drugs to have good results. In this study, the researchers will first treat your disease with bortezomib and dexamethasone. If the disease is not well controlled with these 2 drugs, only then the third drug, lenalidomide, will be added. By using this sequential approach we may reach the same good results with fewer side effects.

overall response rate, (defined as \> or = to PR) after 4 cycles of response-adapted sequential therapy, using bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD) followed by the addition of lenalidomide in suboptimal responders, 2 years
overall response rate, for the entire population after up to 8 cycles of response-adapted sequential therapy, 2 years|response, will be tabulated after the completion of cycle four and cycle eight (for those who would have completed 8 cycles), and the overall response rate for the entire population after up to eight cycles will be estimated and compared to the responses reported in the phase II study by Richardson et al. using the 3-drug-combination., 2 years|toxicity, Before each drug dose, the patient will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0., 2 years|quality of life (QOL), QoL will be assessed in this study using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its corresponding multiple myeloma module (EORTC QLQ-MY20)., 2 years|progression-free survival (PFS), will be estimated for all patients using Kaplan-Meier methodology. This analysis will include all patients regardless of their transplantation status., 2 years|Characterization of genomic mutations of targetable genes, 2 years|Characterization of immunomodulatory checkpoint pathways in multiple myeloma, 2 years
