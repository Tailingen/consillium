Radiotherapy Planning Based on Positron Emission Tomography With Fluoro-deoxyglucose For Advanced NSCLC
Simultaneous radio-chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study focusses on a randomised comparison of conventional radiotherapy planning with irradiation of macroscopic tumor and lymph nodes together with prophylactic target volumes vs. irradiation only of FDG-positive lesions.

Primary endpoint is the local disease control in the chest.
