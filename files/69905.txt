Phase 2 Study Evaluating Mid-position Strategy in Radiotherapy Treatment for Patients With a Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to establish on the market and to clinically evaluate a new strategy of treatment for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer using deformable repositioning of 4D imaging.
