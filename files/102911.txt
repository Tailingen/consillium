Examinations of Tissue From Ablated Malignant Liver Metastases as Predictors of Outcome
The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can do some tests on tissue from the area of the ablation. The investigators want to know if a test can help predict whether the ablation worked.

The treated tumor is normally evaluated with CT. The CT shows signs of treated tumor(s) in the area treated by ablation. However, cancer cells may begin to grow in or near the treated area. The CT scan cannot tell us if the cells are new cancer cells or if they are healthy liver cells that just look different because of the ablation. The test the investigators will study should be able to tell us the difference.
Liver Cancer
OTHER: CT guided percutaneous ablation
Tumor response, will be measured according to EASL and RECIST. In the case of differences between these criteria, the EASL criteria will be used for clinical judgment and decisions.Tumor response will be determined at the discretion of the Principal Investigator in the case of overlapping ablation zones or lesions seen only in PET., 3 years
Duration of treatment response, will be measured as the time from the date of first objective response until the first measurement of progression as determined by the central readers using the EASL criteria. Dynamic Liver CT scans, preferably including the liver triphasic examination will be conducted at each follow-up visit until progression., 3 years
