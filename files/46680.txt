A Clinical Study of Sacituzumab Tirumotecan (MK-2870) in Patients With Bladder Cancer (MK-2870-027)
The goal of the study is to learn about the safety of Sacituzumab Tirumotecan and if people can tolerate it when given in the bladder and find the highest dose that people can take without having certain problems. Researchers will then choose a dose level of Sacituzumab Tirumotecan to use in future studies to learn how well the drug works.
Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Sacituzumab tirumotecan|DRUG: Rescue medication|DRUG: Supportive care measures
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT will be defined as any drug-related adverse event (AE) observed during the DLT evaluation period (7 weeks). All toxicities will be graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to approximately 7 weeks|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 10 weeks|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 6 weeks
Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC), Blood samples will be collected to determine the AUC of sac-TIMT ADC, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of sac-TMT ADC, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmax of sac-TMT ADC, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of sac-TMT ADC, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmin of sac-TMT ADC, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Serum Apparent terminal half-life (t½) of sac-TMT ADC, Blood samples will be collected to determine the t1/2 of sac-TMT ADC, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Serum AUC of sac-TMT Total Antibody (TAb), Blood samples will be collected to determine the AUC of sac-TMT Tab, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Serum Cmax of sac-TMT Tab, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmax of sac-TMT Tab, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Serum Cmin of sac-TMT Tab, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmin of sac-TMT Tab, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Serum t½ of sac-TMT Tab, Blood samples will be collected to determine the t1/2 of sac-TMT Tab, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Plasma AUC of sac-TMT payload, Blood samples will be collected to determine the AUC of sac-TMT payload, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Plasma Cmax of sac-TMT payload, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmax of sac-TMT payload, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Plasma Cmin of sac-TMT payload, Blood samples will be collected to determine the Cmin of sac-TMT payload, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Plasma t½ of sac-TMT payload, Blood samples will be collected to determine the t1/2 of sac-TMT payload, Up to approximately 6 weeks|Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the percentage of participants who will be absent of residual tumor in the bladder assessed locally by cystoscopy evaluation and negative urine cytology and/or biopsy and imaging if applicable., Up to approximately 6 months|Duration of Complete Response (DCR), Duration of CR for participants who demonstrate CR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR (absence of residual tumor in the bladder assessed locally by cystoscopy evaluation and negative urine cytology and/or biopsy and imaging if applicable) until the occurrence of histologically confirmed nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) by local pathology review or locally advanced or metastatic UC, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months
