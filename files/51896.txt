A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Triplet Combination of Pemetrexed Plus AB928 (Etrumadenant) + AB122 (Zimberelimab) in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic MTAP Deficient Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a Phase 2 open-label, single-arm trial for patients with MTAP-deficient advanced urothelial cancer who had received prior immunotherapy. This is a single site study at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This study will allow patients in second line of treatment for advanced urothelial ca or beyond. All patients must have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy as per current standard of care.
Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Zimberelimab|DRUG: Etrumadenant
Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0 and Number of Participants With Complete or Partial Response as their Best Overall Response per RECIST v1.1., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Objectives:

Primary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the triplet combination regimen.
* To evaluate the clinical activity of the triplet combination regimen.

Secondary Objectives:

* To explore the biological changes in MTAP-deficient UC tumor microenvironment including peripheral T-cells, tumor-infiltrating T-cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs)

Exploratory objective:

* To evaluate survival of patients treated with triplet combination regimen.
