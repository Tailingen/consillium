Gene Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Gliomas
RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for adenovirus p53 into a person's tumor may improve the body's ability to fight cancer.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who have recurrent malignant gliomas.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Ad5CMV-p53 gene|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the biological effects at the molecular level of intratumoral administration of adenovirus p53 gene (Ad-p53) in patients with malignant primary glioma. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral Ad-p53 in these patients. III. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of intratumoral Ad-p53 in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive an initial intratumoral stereotactic injection of adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) over 10 minutes on day 1. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity resulting from this initial injection, patients then undergo tumor resection and receive a series of 1-minute injections of Ad-p53 into the resected tumor cavity wall on day 4. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Ad-p53. If 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level, escalation ceases and the maximum tolerated dose is defined as the previous dose level. Patients are followed closely for 12 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks for 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
