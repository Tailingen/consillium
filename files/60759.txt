Role of Senescent Cells in Uterine Fibroid Pathogenesis (SOUL Study)
The investigators are evaluating the role of senescent cells in uterine fibroids.
Fibroid|Leiomyoma
Develop an atlas to comprehensively quantify the rate of senescent cell (SnC) types in fibroid and myometrium tissue samples, Perform scRNASeq on human fibroids and control myometrium tissue and apply transfer learning algorithm for SnC identification and phenotyping to identify cell-cell communication patterns in fibroids versus control myometrial tissue using Domino to validate computationally predicted senescent cell types. The computationally predicted immune phenotypes will be validated with flow cytometry., 5 years
Validate the concentration senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP) in cell cultures of senescent cells in uterine fibroids, Quantify levels of transcripts and proteins in the fibroid senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP) using ELISA and western blotting techniques, 5 years|Rate of inhibition of cellular proliferation and ECM deposition by senolytics and senomorphics in fibroids, Examine the in-vitro effects of senotherapeutcis using leiomyoma culture models and in mouse models. Measured by inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, inhibition ECM deposition, decrease in SnCs (senolytics) and senescence-associated secretory profile SASPs (senomorphics)., 5 years
Uterine fibroids are prevalent tumors of uterus characterized by excessive fibrotic tissues. Using new cutting-edge computational methods, the investigators have found that small groups of senescent cells in fibroids work in concert with immune cells to produce soluble factors in fibroid tissues to create a feed-forward loop leading to fibrosis. This project seeks to unravel key cell-cell communication networks involving senescent and immune cells in fibroids to develop new treatments for uterine fibroids.
