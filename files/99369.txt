Anastrozole Biphosphonate Study in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone-Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety parameters of anastrozole with regard to its potential effects on postmenopausal bone loss and on lipid profiles. This trial is conducted to investigate the effects of risedronate on BMD and on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women using anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer and who are high or moderate risk of fragility fracture. It is also conducted to determine the effects of anastrozole on bone mineral density (BMD) and on bone metabolism in women at low risk of fragility fracture.
