Randomized Phase II Study to Assess PD 0332991 in Breast Cancer
This is a Phase II study trying to identify whether short term treatment with PD0332991 yields anti-proliferative response -defined by a low level of Ki67 expression (IHC) at surgery- or induces senescence as determined by SABG expression (IHC) in tumors from patients with early breast cancer non-candidates for neoadjuvant hormonotherapy or chemotherapy, as compared to no treatment.
Untreated Operable Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: PD0332991
Anti proliferative response, percentage of patients who at Day 15 have a natural logarithm of percentage positive IHC staining Ki67 of \<1 for each study drug (Ki67 "absolute" antiproliferative responders)., Assessed at Day 15 after randomization
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Using NCI CTCAE 4.0, Assessed at Day 8 and 15 after randomization|Ki67, Relative change from baseline to surgery in Ki67 IHC expression ("relative" antripoliferative responders), Assessed at Day15 after randomization
