Cervical Cancer
Systemic consolidation therapy with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (3 cycles per 3 weeks) following primary chemoradiation (3 cycles per 3 weeks) for locally advanced cervical cancer will elevate the therapeutic efficacy by removing the microscopic metastatic lesions which could not be identified by naked eye and diagnostic imaging tests.
