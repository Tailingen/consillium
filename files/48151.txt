Safety and Efficacy of CT125A Cells for Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory CD5+ Hematopoietic Malignancies
Current treatments for relapsed/refractory hematopoietic malignancies such as B-cell lymphomas (BCLs) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are far from satisfactory. CD5 is widely expressed in multiple subtypes of BCLs and PTCLs but rarely found in normal tissues except certain types of lymphocytes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells against CD5 offer another potential therapeutic option for patients with relapsed/refractory CD5 positive hematopoietic malignancies. In the current study, the safety and efficacy of a novel CAR T cell therapy, termed CT125A cells, are evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory CD5+ hematopoietic malignancies. The endogenous CD5 in CT125A cells is knocked out via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to prevent fratricide during CAR T cells manufacturing.

Incidence and types of dose limited toxicities (DLTs) following infusion of CT125A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, Incidence and types of dose limited toxicities (DLTs) after administration of CT125A cells in patients with relapsed/refractory CD5+ hematopoietic malignancies will be recorded at 3 dose levels to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of CT125A. DLT is defined as the following adverse events that occur during the first 28 days after CT125A infusion and are definitely or probably related to CT125A cells: 1) Cytokine release syndrome equal or greater than grade 4 lasting longer than 3 days graded by ASTCT 2019 consensus; 2) Grade 4 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome graded by ASTCT 2019 consensus; 3) Grade 4 hematological toxicity lasting longer than 28 days except for T cell aplasia; 4) Non-hematological toxicity equal or greater than grade 3 lasting longer than 7 days or Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity lasting longer than 3 days., 28 days after CAR T cell infusion|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) following infusion of CT125A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, Incidence of adverse events (AEs) after administration of each dose of CT125A cells in patients with relapsed/refractory CD5+ hematopoietic malignancies will be recorded and the severity of AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 except that cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome will be graded according to the consensus by ASTCT in 2019. AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient after CAR T cell infusion and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., 2 years after CAR T cell infusion
Overall response rate (ORR) at 4th week and 12th week, At 4 weeks and 12 weeks after CT125A infusion, the response rate of subjects that are evaluated as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Lugano 2014 criteria will be measured, 12 weeks after CAR T cell infusion|Time to first response after CT125A cells infusion, The number of days elapsed between the time when subjects receive CT125A infusion and the time when the response is first evaluated as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) will be measured, 2 years after CAR T cell infusion|Time to complete response (CR) after CT125A infusion, The number of days elapsed between the time when subjects receive CT125A infusion and the time when the response is first evaluated as complete response (CR) will be measured, 2 years after CAR T cell infusion
Best overall response (BOR) 3 months after CT125A cells infusion, Within 3 months after CT125A infusion, the percentage of subjects whose best responses are evaluated as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) will be measured, 3 months after CAR T cell infusion|Duration of response (DOR), The number of days between the time when the response is first evaluated as CR or PR after CT125A infusion and the time when the subject is first evaluated to have progressive disease (PD) or dies for any reason, 2 years after CAR T cell infusion|Progression free survival (PFS), The number of days between the time when subjects receive CT125A infusion and the time when the subject is first evaluated to have progressive disease (PD) or dies for any reason, 2 years after CAR T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), The number of days between the time when subjects receive CT125A infusion and the time when subjects die for any reason, 2 years after CAR T cell infusion|Quantification of vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood following CT125A infusion by ddPCR, The vector copy number (VCN) of CAR transgene measured as copies per microgram of genomic DNA in peripheral blood will be determined by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) analysis before CT125A infusion; on day 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, and 28; week 8, 12, 24, and 36; and every 3 month 9 months after CT125A infusion. The kinetics of VCN will be plotted to assess the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells., 2 years after CAR T cell infusion|Assessment of CAR T cells expansion in peripheral blood or bone marrow following CT125A infusion by flow cytometry, The absolute number of CAR T cells per milli-liter of peripheral blood will be determined by flow cytometry analysis and absolute lymphocyte count test before CT125A infusion; on day 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, and 28; week 8, 12, 24, and 36; and every 3 month 9 months after CT125A infusion.
