A Study Investigating AGEN1777 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a multicenter, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of AGEN1777 as a single agent and when used in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in participants with advanced, metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: AGEN1777|DRUG: a PD-1 inhibitor
Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) of AGEN1777 as a Single-Agent and in Combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, Day 1 through Day 21|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Up to 2 years and 90 days
