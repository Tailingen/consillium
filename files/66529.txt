This study used a Simon two-stage design, with at least 43 subjects enrolled, includs the patients with advanced pancreatic cancer whose second-line treatment has failed, or those with poor performance status (PS score \>1) who cannot tolerate the second-line regimen with two or more chemotherapeutic drugs. All subjects enrolled receive the treatment of metronomic capecitabine with camrelizumab and apatinib mesylate until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or the ended of study.
