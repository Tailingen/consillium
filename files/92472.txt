Capecitabine Plus Aflibercept as Maintenance Therapy Following Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin Plus Aflibercept in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Primary Objective:

Efficacy: To assess the progression-free survival rate at 10 months in patients on maintenance therapy with capecitabine plus aflibercept.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate:

* Efficacy: Progression Free Survival (PFS)
* Efficacy: Overall Survival (OS)
* Efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) criteria
* Health related Quality of Life (HRQL): EORTC QLQ-C30 scores and EQ5D-3L
* Safety

Exploratory Objective:

To collect blood and tumor samples to perform investigations for potential biomarker testing.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Time, every 9 weeks, up to 28 months|Overall Survival (OS) - Time, every 9 weeks, up to 28 months|Assessment of Objective Response Rate (ORR), every 9 weeks, up to 28 months|Total Score as a measure of Health Related Quality of Life, every 3 weeks, up to end of treatment|Number of participants with adverse events, up to 30 days after last treatment
Total study duration for a participant can be up to 28 months.

This trial is being conducted in countries where the INN designation for the study molecule is "aflibercept" and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US proper name is "ziv-aflibercept".
