Treatment of Breast Fibroadenoma With High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)
This is a monocenter, open-label, uncontrolled study in accordance with ยง23b MPG to evaluate the efficacy of the HIFU-treatment of fibroadenoma using the TH-One device.
Breast Fibroadenoma
DEVICE: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
The efficacy is assessed by a reduction in volume of the fibroadenoma at baseline, 6 months and at 12 months after the HIFU on the ultrasonography., A reduction in volume of \> 65% compared to baseline, or a total regression of the fibroadenoma will be taken as effective treatment. The results will be analyzed descriptively, Baseline, 6 months, 12 months
Energy setting to obtain reduction in volume or total regression of the fibroadenoma at 12 months follow-up, 1 year|Lack of palpable lesion, 2 years|Pain free if pain at baseline (pain related to the fibroadenoma), 1 year|Gland vascularisation (compared to baseline) power Doppler at day 7, month 6 and 12 after the HIFU session, Day 7, month 6, month 12|Pain during the HIFU session using a Visual Analog Pain Scale, 0 month|Histological outcome through core needle biopsy after 12 month, 1 year|Quality and ease of use of breast immobilization, 1 year
