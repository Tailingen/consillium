A Non-Interventional Study of Treatment Pattern and Clinical Outcomes in Chinese Participants With Gastric Cancer
This prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in routine clinical practice in Chinese participants with gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer. The study will be conducted in 5 cohorts and eligible participants will be enrolled and assigned to the various cohorts according to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, disease stage and treatment with trastuzumab according to physician's decision. Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in participants with gastric cancer in China will be evaluated. The total study duration is 60 months.
