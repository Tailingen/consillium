Clinical Sequencing Project for Metastatic Cancer Patients for Personalized Cancer Clinic.
The next generation of personalized medical treatment according to the type of personal genetic information are evolving rapidly. The genome analysis needs systematic infra and database based on personal genetic information. Therefore, a big data of genome-clinical information is important.

To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor's molecular profiling and targeted therapies in the treatment of advanced cancer and to determine the clinical outcome(Response rate,PFS, duration of response and overall survival )of patients with advanced cancer, the investigators are going to take a tumor tissue of patients and process molecular profiling and receive molecular profile directed treatments.
Metastatic Cancer
Response rate, 1 year
Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Duration of response, 1 year|Overall survival, 1 year
