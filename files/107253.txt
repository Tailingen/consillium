Bintrafusp Alfa Combination Therapy in Participants With Cervical Cancer (INTR@PID 046)
This study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bintrafusp alfa in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in participants with locally advanced or advanced cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: M7824|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as Adverse Events (AEs) with any of following toxicities: Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity lasting more than equal to (\>=) 7 days despite medical intervention; Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea lasting \>= 3 days despite supportive care; Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic lab value leading to hospitalization or persisting for \>= 7 days; Grade 3 or Grade 4: grade 3 is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than (\<) 1,000/mm3 with a temperature of \> 38.3 degree Celsius (°C); grade 4 is defined as ANC \< 1,000/mm3 with a temperature of \> 38.3°C, with life-threatening consequences; Thrombocytopenia \< 25,000/mm3 associated with bleeding not resulting in hemodynamic instability or a life-threatening bleeding resulting in urgent intervention; Bleeding events \>= Grade 3 occurring within 5 days of bintrafusp alfa treatment; Prolonged delay (\> 3 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Grade 5 toxicity., Up to 4 weeks after first administration of study intervention|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Event (AE) was defined any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a study drug, which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as events with onset date or worsening during the on-treatment period. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs included serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 20 months
Immediate Observed Serum Concentration at End of Infusion (Ceoi) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Ceoi was the observed concentration at the end of the infusion period. This was taken directly from the observed Bintrafusp Alfa concentration-time data., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Serum Trough Concentration Levels (Ctrough) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Ctrough was the serum concentration observed immediately before next dosing., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-t) of Bintrafusp Alfa, The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero (= dosing time) to the last sampling time (tlast) at which the concentration is at or above the lower limit of quantification. Calculated using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule (linear up, log down)., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Bintrafusp Alfa, AUC0-inf was calculated by combining AUC0-t and AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast pred/Lambda z, where Clast pred was the calculated serum concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured serum concentration is at or above the Lower Limit of quantification (LLQ) and Lambda z was the apparent terminal rate constant determined by log-linear regression analysis of the measured serum concentrations of the terminal log-linear phase., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Cmax was obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Time to Reach Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) of Bintrafusp Alfa, The time to reach the maximum observed concentration collected during a dosing interval. Tmax was obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Terminal Elimination Half-Life (T1/2) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Elimination Half Life (T1/2) was defined as the time required for the concentration or amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one-half. Elimination half-life determined as 0.693/ Lamda z(λz), λz=terminal first order (elimination) rate constant., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) of Bintrafusp Alfa, A validated method was applied to detect ADAs in the presence of drug in human serum. The ADA titers of positive samples were determined., Pre-dose Up to 20 months|Number of Japanese Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as Adverse Events (AEs) with any of following toxicities: Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity lasting more than equal to (\>=) 7 days despite medical intervention; Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea lasting \>= 3 days despite supportive care; Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic lab value leading to hospitalization or persisting for \>= 7 days; Grade 3 or Grade 4: grade 3 is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than (\<) 1,000/mm3 with a temperature of \> 38.3 degree Celsius (°C); grade 4 is defined as ANC \< 1,000/mm3 with a temperature of \> 38.3°C, with life-threatening consequences; Thrombocytopenia \< 25,000/mm3 associated with bleeding not resulting in hemodynamic instability or a life-threatening bleeding resulting in urgent intervention; Bleeding events \>= Grade 3 occurring within 5 days of bintrafusp alfa treatment; Prolonged delay (\> 3 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Grade 5 toxicity., Up to 4 weeks after first administration of study intervention|Number of Japanese Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Event (AE) was defined any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a study drug, which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were defined as events with onset date or worsening during the on-treatment period. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 20 months
