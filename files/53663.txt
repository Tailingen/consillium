The Study of Plum-blossom Needling Enhancing Efficacy of Aminolevulinic Acid-photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratosis
Background Limited in the depth of absorption and penetration of photosensitizers, ALA-PDT treatment is not strong enough for thickening significantly AK lesions. Pre-study has proved that plum-blossom needling facilitates delivery of topical ALA into the dermis. It could help ALA to diffuse a little more broadly in superficial dermis and obtain similar clinical effect with a much lower cost.

Objective We sought to investigate whether plum-blossom needling (PBN) would enhance the efficacy of ALA-PDT for AKs.

Methods Two hundred and fifty patients, previously diagnosed as having AKs of the face and scalp, were randomized distribution into two groups. The PBN-ALA-PDT group underwent vertical skin tapping with PBN before applying 10% ALA cream and narrow-band light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (mean 633 nm, with a standard deviation \[SD\] of 10 nm; 100-200 J/cm2). The ALA-PDT group received ALA cream and irradiation only. During the next 1 year period of follow up, patients were clinically evaluated for new AKs.
Actinic Keratoses
DEVICE: PBN
The clearance rate of Actinic Keratoses, The change rate in lesion clearance of Actinic Keratoses at two weeks after the first session will be measured as the primary outcome, two weeks after first session
Treatment sessions, Number of treatment sessions required for clinical cure, two weeks after the last session|Number of new Actinic Keratoses, The change in number of actinic keratoses at each follow-up will be measured as the second outcome, 1, 3, 12 months after last session|Adverse events, Measurement of crusting, erythema, edema, pain and et al., 1, 3, 12 months after last session
