GR1405 Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
This is a Phase I clinical study for evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of repeated doses, dose escalation of GR1405 injection in patients with advanced solid tumor or lymphoma
Tumor, Solid|Lymphoma
DRUG: GR1405 injection
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated dose of GR1405 injection, 2 weeks|Adverse Events, Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Approximately 3 years
maximum concentration (Cmax), the maximum exposure to a biologically active physica, Approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR by RECIST v. 1.1 or Lugano 2014, the time between the initial response to therapy and subsequent disease progression or relapse, Approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate(ORR), Objective Response Rate(ORR) by RECIST v. 1.1 or Lugano 2014, ORR=complete response(CR) + partial response(PR), Approximately 3 years|Progression free survival(PFS), Progression free survival(PFS) by RECIST v. 1.1 or Lugano 2014, a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works, Approximately 3 years|Immunogenicity, the ability to elicit an immune response of GR1405 injection,, Approximately 3 years|Recommended dose for Phase II trial(RP2D), The MTD is one dose level below the lowest dose tested in which 2 or more patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) attributable to the study drug. The MTD will be the RP2D, Approximately 3 years|AUC0-t, Area under the curve in the period from 0 to t, Approximately 2 years|AUC0-∞, Area under the curve in the period from 0 to ∞, Approximately 2 years|AUCss, Area under the curve of Steady-State Plasma Concentrations, Approximately 2 years|T max, the time of occurrence of peak drug concentration, Approximately 2 years|t 1/2, the time of half-life of the drug, Approximately 2 years|apparent volume of distribution (Vz), the volume of fluid that would be required to contain the amount of drug in the body, Approximately 2 years|clearance(CL), the rate of elimination of the drug in vivo, Approximately 2 years
To evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of GR1405 injection monotherapy in an open, non-controlled, escalating trial design in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Four dose levels (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg) were evaluated at this stage.
