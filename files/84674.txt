Cytokine-induced Killer Cell Immunotherapy for Surgical Resected Stage III Colorectal Cancer Patients After Chemotherapy
We hypothesize through this randomized, prospective, single center adjuvant study, that cytokine-induced killer cell in patients with stage III colon cancer can improve survival in this patient population over control. Stage III colon cancer patients can benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy, but the 5 year survival rate is still around 60%. We wish CIK cell therapy can improve the survival rate of stage III colon cancer patients.
