Phase I Clinical Trial of BH002 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to about in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* question 1:Evaluating the tolerability of BH002 injection in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors
* question 2:Obtain the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BH002 injection in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors

To evaluate the safety of BH002 in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors., Rates and severity of adverse events., From first dose to 30 days after last dose|Evaluating the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BH002 in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors, Preliminary observation of the therapeutic effect of the drug., From first dose to 30 days after last dose|Determination of recommended phase â…¡ dose (RP2D), Explore clinically applicable doses and dosage regimens in the next phase., 21 days after first dose
Subjects will be administered BH002 intravenously. It is expected that there will be 2 to 4 dose groups, with 3 to 6 subjects enrolled in each group. The doses from low to high are 15 mg/m2,20 mg/m2,25 mg/m2,30 mg/m2,35 mg/m2. Subjects were injected with BH002 intravenously on the first day of each cycle, once during a 3-week period.

The dose escalation for this trial will be 20mg/m2 as the starting dose. According to the traditional "3+3" dose escalation principle, 3 subjects are planned to be enrolled in each dose group at the same time. Safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed within 21 days of first dose.
