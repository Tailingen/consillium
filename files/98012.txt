Phase I Clinical Trial of RC19D2 Cell Injection in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This trial is a phase I clinical trial aimed at the safety and tolerability of RC19D2 cell injection in the treatment of CD19 positive patients with recurrent or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Recurrent Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: RC19D2 cell injection
MTD, Determine the maximum tolerable dose(MTD) based on the 28 day dose limit toxicity occurrence of all participants., 28 days|AE Safety, Number of participants with Adverse event (AESI, ADR, SAE, etc.), with abnormal laboratory test results, abnormal vital signs, abnormal physical examination findings and abnormal 12 lead electrocardiogram readings, 2 years
This trial is a Phase I clinical trial, which is divided into two trial stages. The first stage is a dose-increasing trial stage The second stage is the dose extension experiment stage.

The main endpoint is to evaluate its tolerance and safety. The first dose group used rapid titration method for dose increase, and the subsequent dose groups used the classic 3+3 experimental design for dose increase. A total of 4 dose groups are planned to be set up. The second to fourth dose groups will include 3-6 participants in each group
