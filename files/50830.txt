Carboplatin AUC-10 With Early PET Scanning in Metastatic Seminoma
This study evaluated the safety, efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin area under the curve (AUC)-10 in metastatic seminoma to see if, by using fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to assess metabolic response, the number of patients requiring 4 cycles can be reduced. Carboplatin AUC-10 was given every 21 days. A PET-CT scan was carried out on day 17-21 of the first cycle. If the PET - CT scan showed a complete response patients received 3 cycles of treatment. If the PET - CT scan did not show a complete response patients received 4 cycles of treatment. After treatment, patients were followed up for 2 years.
