Phase I Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile of HM781-36B in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HM781-36B.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HM781-36B
MTD determination, Dose limiting Toxicity will be evaluated on Day 21 during Cycle 1
Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows:

1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of HM781-36B
2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of HM781-36B, following oral administration of HM781-36B
3. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B in patients with advanced solid malignancies Groups of 3 patients per cohort or dose level will be treated with escalating doses of HM781-36B
