506U78 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or T-cell Lymphoma
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or T-cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die

DRUG: nelarabine
Response rate (RR), defined as CR + PR, Up to 5 years
Failure-free survival, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral T-cell lymphoma when treated with 506U78.

II. Assess the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.
