Efficacy and Safety Study of Tisotumab Vedotin for Patients With Solid Tumors
This trial will study tisotumab vedotin to find out whether it is an effective treatment alone or with other anticancer drugs for certain solid tumors and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur. There are seven parts to this study.

* In Part A, the treatment will be given to participants every 3 weeks (3-week cycles).
* In Part B, participants will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4-week cycle.
* In Part C, participants will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1 and 15 of every 4-week cycle.
* In Part D, participants will be given treatment on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle. Participants in Part D will get tisotumab vedotin with either:

  * Pembrolizumab or,
  * Pembrolizumab and carboplatin, or
  * Pembrolizumab and cisplatin
* In Part E, participants will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1 and 15 of every 4-week cycle.
* In Part F, participants will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 15, and 29 of every 6-week cycle. Participants in Part F will get tisotumab vedotin with pembrolizumab.
* In Part G, participants will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 15, and 29 of every 6-week cycle. Participants in Part G will get tisotumab vedotin with pembrolizumab and carboplatin.

The primary goal of this trial is to assess the activity, safety, and tolerability of tisotumab vedotin for the treatment of selected solid tumors. Patients will be treated with single agent tisotumab vedotin or tisotumab vedotin in combination with other anticancer agents. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled into cohorts based on tumor type. Tumor types to be evaluated include colorectal cancer, squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC), exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
