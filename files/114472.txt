A Trial Looking at Rituximab and Chemotherapy as a Treatment for Follicular Lymphoma in Elderly Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether R-FC is more beneficial that R-CVP in the treatment of older patients (aged 60 or over) with Follicular Lymphoma (FL).
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Fludarabine
Toxicity, The second primary outcome measure is grade 3-4 infection occurring anytime from the start of treatment until 6 months following the last dose of treatment, and this will be used as the toxicity end-point. Toxicity will be measured according to standard National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 following each cycle of treatment and at each subsequent follow-up visit until 6 months following the last dose of treatment., 36 months|Progression-free survival, 30 months

FL predominantly affects the elderly, yet the optimum treatment for older patients with the disease has not been defined. The present study aims to address this question by comparing the drug combination that is currently considered the gold-standard (R-CVP) with a newer combination (R-FC) that might be more effective without being significantly more toxic. In order to take into account the balance between efficacy and toxicity, a dual primary endpoint has been employed: progression-free survival and toxicity in the form of grade 3-4 infection.
