Study of Docetaxel, Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Advanced Stomach Cancer
Considering synergism between docetaxel (D), capecitabine (X), and oxaliplatin (O) and favourable toxicity profile of oxaliplatin over cisplatin, it is to be expected that combination of docetaxel, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (DXO) will be more effective than other regimens and feasible in advanced gastric cancer. DXO regimen can be also easily administered on out-patient setting. However, so far, DXO combination has not been tried in advanced gastric cancer. The investigators will determine maximum tolerated dose of DXO regimen in this phase I study.
Stomach Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel, Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin
Number of Participants With DLTs, Dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) was determined during the Wrst two cycles of treat- ment. The definitions of DLTs were as follows: (1) grade 4 neutropenia lasting for more than 5 days, or grade 3/4 neu- tropenia with fever; (2) grade 4 thrombocytopenia; (3) any other grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (excluding alope- cia); or (4) treatment delay of more than 2 weeks following the time of planned treatment. Maximal tolerated dose was defined as that the DLTs were observed in two or more patients from a cohort of two to six patients, 2 years
