Added Value of Preoperative Contrast Enhanced Mammography in Staging of Malignant Breast Lesions
Patients diagnosed with breast cancer after routine assessment with digital mammography and ultrasound and scheduled for primary surgery are included in the trial. The patients are randomized 1:1 to go through additional contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) or no further imaging preoperatively. Primary endpoint is rate of patients with change of treatment: a) mastectomy instead of partial mastectomy due larger unifocal or multifocal extent, b) partial mastectomy instead of mastectomy due to improved demarcation of the tumour area, c) bilateral surgery instead of unilateral due to findings of contralateral cancer, d) neoadjuvant therapy instead of primary surgery due to more advanced disease. Rate of reoperation and rate of avoidable mastectomies are secondary endpoints.
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast Enhanced Mammography (CEM)
Rate of patients with change of primary treatment due to findings at additional CEM, Mastectomy instead of partial mastectomy due to findings of multifocal disease, mastectomy instead of partial mastectomy due to larger unifocal extent, partial mastectomy instead of mastectomy due to improved demarcation of tumour area, bilateral surgery due to findings of contralateral cancer, primary neoadjuvant treatment instead of primary surgery due to more advanced disease, Within two months after diagnosis of breast cancer
Rate of reoperations, Number of reoperations due to inadequate margins, Within three months after diagnosis of breast cancer|Rate of avoidable mastectomies, Patients operated with mastectomy where histopathology shows extent less than 3 cm, Within three months after diagnosis of breast cancer
