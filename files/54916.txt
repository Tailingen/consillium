Complications and Clinical Response in Cancer Patients Treated With Anti-VEGF-Related Therapies
This study collects information about complications and clinical response in cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF-related therapies. This study aims to observe side effects that may happen to patients with advanced cancer who are treated with anti-VEGF related therapy. This may help doctors learn if there are any relationships between these side effects and how the disease may respond to treatment.

OTHER: Electronic Health Record Review
Incidence of grade 3+ adverse events (AE) at least possibly related to anti-VEGF-related treatment (overall and each type separately), For each toxicity, will estimate the odds ratio, associated 95% confidence interval and p-value., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To explore the incidence of clinical complications associated with anti-VEGF-related therapies in cancer patients treated at Emory University and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore the correlation of clinical response rates to a novel blood pressure scoring system in cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF-related therapies.

II. To explore the correlation of objective response to each toxicity grade 3 or higher in cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF-related therapies.

III. To investigate the validity of a novel multi-parameter-based blood pressure scoring system and to determine if the new scoring method is concordant with the current Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) method.

OUTLINE:

Patients' medical records are reviewed.
