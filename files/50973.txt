Anatomy-based Resection or Margin-based Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Anatomical liver resection was widely accepted as first line curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, number of retrospective clinical studies showed no priority of anatomical resection for hepatocellular, compared with non-anatomical resection.

Surgical resection margin is a essential factor that may affect tumor prognosis. It is controversial whether adequate liver resection margin is associated with improved survival outcome in patients with hepatocellular.

There was few prospective clinical trial to investigate whether anatomical liver resection is superior to non-anatomical resection or liver resection with adequate margin is superior to that with inadequate margin. This prospective clinical trial aims at fix these issues.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma by BCLC Stage
PROCEDURE: anatomical liver resection
prognosis, 3 year and 5 year overall survival and disease free survival, 5 years
postoperative recovery, postoperative complications, 30 days postoperatively|hospital stay, hospital days after operation, 60 days postoperatively
surgery duration, time duration of liver parenchyma transection, 24 hours|volume of bleeding, millilitre of blood lost during operation, 24 hours|volume of transfusion, units of blood transfusion, 24 hours
In the anatomical liver resection group, liver segmentectomy or lobectomy is performed to insure curative resection (R0 resection). The region of liver resected is based on the anatomy or portal vein and hepatic vein. The liver pedicle of the tumor located lobe is exposed and dissected, which is principle to perform anatomical liver resection.

In the non-anatomical liver resection group, the liver parenchyma transection is around 0-2 cm from the tumor margin, according to tumor size and location.
