Impact of Geriatrician Interventions on Chemotherapy Delivery in Vulnerable Elderly Oncology Patients
This is a randomized parallel group trial designed to evaluate the impact of implementing geriatrician-prescribed interventions based on the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy treatment, as measured by relative dose intensity (RDI).

Relative dose intensity, Relative dose intensity (RDI) is defined as the ratio (in percentage) of the total administered dose of chemotherapy to the standard dose of the same chemotherapy regimen, as defined by the treating centre. RDI will be calculated as the total dose delivered from the first day of cycle 1 of chemotherapy until completion of the planned chemotherapy (average of 6 months for early, 3 months for metastatic disease), or until date of relapse or death or discontinuation from any cause, whichever occurs first., 6 months
Occurrence of treatment-related toxicity, Severity will be reported based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, every 3-4 weeks up to 6 months|Occurrence of hospitalization, Documentation of hospitalization, at 6 months for early and at 3 months for metastatic disease|Early mortality, Documentation of death, death from any cause occurring 12 months of randomization for neo/adjuvant patients, or within 6 months for patients with metastatic disease
Optional Translational Substudy: Blood metabolites, Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR) metabolomics spectra will be derived from a 10ml fasting peripheral serum sample collected prior to commencing chemotherapy, up to 12 months
This randomized parallel group trial is designed to evaluate the impact of implementing geriatrician-prescribed interventions, on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy treatment, as measured by RDI of at least 85%, in a cohort of vulnerable \[≥1 deficit identified at CGA and/or ≥1 comorbidity Grade 3-4 as defined by Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)\] elderly cancer patients with early stage or advanced solid organ malignancies.

Patients will be randomized using a 2:1 allocation to Arm A: routine oncological care plus geriatric intervention or Arm B: routine oncological care
