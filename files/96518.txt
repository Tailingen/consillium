Maintenance Niraparib Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Whose Disease Has Not Progressed on Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
The main goal of this study is to look at the effectiveness and anti-tumor activity (preventing growth of the tumor) of the drugs niraparib and ipilimumab, on the patients and their pancreatic cancer. This study will involve two different treatment arms. In Arm A, patients will receive niraparib plus ipilimumab. In Arm B, patients will receive standard chemotherapy.

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Does niraparib plus ipilimumab slow down tumor growth in patients with pancreatic cancer?
* What medical problems do participants have when taking niraparib plus ipilimumab?

Participants will:

* Undergo screening procedures to evaluate their cancer, overall health, and suitability for the study
* After passing screening, will be randomized to Arm A or B and be scheduled to receive niraparib plus ipilimumab (Arm A) or chemotherapy (Arm B)
* Receive niraparib plus ipilimumab every 3 weeks (Arm A)
* Receive chemotherapy every 2 weeks (Arm B)
* Visit the clinic for regular checkups and tests
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Metastatic
DRUG: Niraparib|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Progression-free survival (PFS) in the experimental arm, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by the investigator, or death from any cause. Median PFS and 95% confidence interval will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. In the primary outcome measure, PFS will be assessed in Arm A., From Cycle 1 (each cycle in Arm A is 21 days) Day 1 to disease progression, loss to follow-up or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 42 months.
