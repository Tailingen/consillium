ADP-A2M4CD8 Monotherapy and in Combination with Nivolumab in HLA-A2+ Subjects with MAGE-A4 Positive Ovarian Cancer (SURPASS-3)
This is a phase 2, open-label, randomized, non-comparative clinical trial to evaluate the clinical outcome of ADP A2M4CD8 as monotherapy and in combination treatment with nivolumab in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2+ subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer positive for MAGE-A4.
Ovarian Cancer
GENETIC: Autologous genetically modified ADP-A2M4CD8 cells|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Autologous genetically modified ADP-A2M4CD8 cells in combination with Nivolumab
To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of genetically modified autologous T-cells (ADP-A2M4CD8) as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in HLA-A*02 positive subjects with MAGE-A4 positive recurrent ovarian cancer, Overall Response (OR) is defined as incidence of (confirmed) complete responses or partial responses as assessed by RECIST v1.1 by IRAC from T-cell infusion until documented disease progression, 3.6 years
