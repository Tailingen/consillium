Nimotuzumab in Combined With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin for Treatment of Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This clinical study is designed as a phase 3,multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with paclitaxel+cisplatin（TP) compared with TP as first-line treatment for the metastatic esophageal squamous carcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinomas
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Placebo
Median time of overall survival(OS), Record all the survival status of each patient and calculate the median OS of all the patients, Up to 12 months
Median time of progression-free survival（PFS）, PFS is the time that passes from the date of signing Informed Consent Form（ICF）to the data on which "progresses" or the date on which the patient dies from any cause. The definition of "progression" since this generally involves imaging techniques(CT,MRI,et al).The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECISIT) 1.1 criteria will be used to evaluate "progression".The imaging evaluation will be done every 6 weeks., Up to 12 months|Objective response rate（ORR）, This wil be evaluated by RECISIT 1.1 criteria.It is dependent on imaging evaluation which will be done every 6 weeks. ORR is the percent of the patient who is evaluated as complete response(CR) or partial response (PR),that is (CR+PR)%., Up to 12 months|Quality of life, Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer（EORTC）quality of life questionnaire（QLQ）-C30（Version3.0）and EORTC QLQ - OES18 to evaluate the quality of life of patients. The patients will fill this questionnaire when signing the ICF(as baseline) and every 6 weeks during treatment,until disease progression,up to 52 weeks. The progression is from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause., baseline;once every 6 weeks until progression(6 weeks,12 weeks,18 weeks,up to 52 weeks)|Incidence of adverse events, Up to 30 days after last administration of nimotuzumab
This clinical study is designed as a phase 3,multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with TP compared with TP as first-line treatment for the metastatic esophageal squamous carcinoma.The main endpoint is OS.
