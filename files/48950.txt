Nivolumab in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Mesothelioma
This is a prospective, single arm, phase II trial in previously treated patients with MPM who are considered candidates for immunotherapy and repeat thoracoscopies/transthoracic biopsies. Nivolumab will be administered 3 mg/kg q2 weeks by intravenous injection.

The administration of nivolumab as monotherapy will improve DCR form 20% to 40% at 12 weeks when compared to DCR of patients treated with best supportive care based on historical controls.

Exploratory, The effects of nivolumab on tissue samples with respect to influx of immuno-modulating cells and the PD-L1 status of tumors and other possible biomarkers and explore correlations between biomarkers and anti-tumor activity., At screening and after cycle 3 (day 35-50)
Patients will undergo pre- and post-treatment thoracoscopies/biopsies.
