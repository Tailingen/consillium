ZD4054 With Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to assess the effects of ZD4054 on prostate cancer that has spread to the bones by using new imaging techniques. In particular, this study will use fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-Sodium Fluoride (NaF) PET/computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans to look for changes in bone metastasis after ZD4054 therapy.
