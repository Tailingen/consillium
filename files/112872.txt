Improving Informed Decision Making for Cancer Clinical Trial Participation
The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a multi-communication approach to improve informed decision-making about cancer Clinical Trials (CTs) participation by increasing awareness of CTs and Mays Cancer Center (MCC) services (treatment care capacities, reputation and resources), positive attitudes towards CTs, self-efficacy and intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate treatment option for cancer (intention to participate) among patients attending the MCC (clinic-based setting) and the general public in selected Bexar County areas (community-based settings).

The proposed two-year study involves a randomized controlled educational trial featuring a 2-group parallel cohort design with random assignment of 400 cancer patients from the MCC to the intervention or usual care control group. Intervention participants will receive 3 components: 1) a bilingual culturally relevant educational video, 2) a low-literacy booklet and 3) support from a patient navigator to empower new cancer patients to make informed decisions about cancer CT participation by increasing awareness of clinical trials and MCC services, positive attitudes and intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate treatment option for cancer. The usual care control group will receive a general CT fact sheet.

The community setting will involve a community awareness campaign including 400 community members, with 3 components: 1) an educational session delivered via PowerPoint presentation or flip chart, 2) a low-literacy booklet, and 3) support from a community health educator to raise awareness, positive attitudes and intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate treatment option for cancer and promote the MCC services among community members in Bexar County.
