Comparison of Interfascial Injection Versus Subpectineal Injection on Ultrasound-guided Obturator Nerve Block
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the ultrasound-guided interfascial injection approach with the subpectineal injection technique for obturator nerve block in bladder cancers undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) under spinal anesthesia.
Bladder Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Interfascial Injection|PROCEDURE: Subpectineal Injection
Success rate of obturatr nerve block, The success or fail of the obturator nerve block will be conformed using nerve stimulator. Detecting muscles twitch will br considered to be a fail., Peroperative period
Number of adductor muscle spazms, Number of adductor muscle spazms in each group will be noted during the intraoperative period., Intraoperative period|Sensory block, Sensory block area will be evaluated by a pin prick at in the dermatomal areas related obturator nerve and branches., 30 minutes after the intervention|Patient satisfaction, Changes in overall satisfaction will be assessed using a 5 point Likert Scale ( 1-very dissatisfied, 2- dissatisfied, 3- neutral, 4-satisfied, 5 - very satisfied, Peroperative period|Procedure time, Block performance time will be recorded from the time the first ultrasound image is obtained until the procedure is completed, During the procedure
