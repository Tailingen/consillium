International Low Anterior Resection Score Evaluation
* Aim: The aim of this study is to perform a prospective, international 4 months cohort study evaluating bowel function before curative rectal cancer surgery and one year after the surgery using the LARS score.
* Primary outcome measure: LARS score before surgery and 1 year after the surgery.
* Primary comparison: Between average LARS score before and after curative surgery and also comparing these with publish LARS score on normal population.
Low Anterior Resection Syndrome
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Patients undergoing low anterior resection
LARS score change comparing before surgery and 1 year after the surgery., Low anterior resection score is a simple questionnaire consisting of five simple questions for bowel function assessment after anterior resection. The maximum number is between 0 and 42. No LARS (good bowel function) is from 0 to 20; minor LARS - 21-29 and major LARS (poor bowel function) more than 29.

Between average LARS score before and after curative surgery and also comparing these with published LARS score on normal population., 12 months
All patients undergoing treatment for rectal rectal will be included in the study. Before any treatment all the included patients will be asked to fill the LARS score (5 question questionnaire with differently weighted answers for assessing the low anterior resection score). One year after the low anterior resection (without the stoma) or following the stoma take down patients will be reassessed. The LARS score will be filled one again. Patient characteristics, age, cancer stage, level of anastomosis will be assessed aswel.
