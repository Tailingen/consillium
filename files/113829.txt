A Trial to Learn Whether Regorafenib in Combination With Nivolumab Can Improve Tumor Responses and How Safe it is for Participants With Solid Tumors
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with solid tumors. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical trials to better understand its safety and how it works.

In this trial, the researchers want to learn about regorafenib taken together with nivolumab in a small number of participants with different types of tumors. These include tumors in the head and neck, the esophagus, the pancreas, the brain, and the biliary tract. The biliary tract includes gall bladder and bile ducts.

The trial will include about 200 participants who are at least 18 years old. All of the participants will take 90 mg of regorafenib as a tablet by mouth. The dose of regorafenib can be adjusted up to 120 mg or down to 60 mg by the doctor based on how well a participant tolerates treatment. All of the participants will receive 480 milligrams (mg) of nivolumab through a needle put into a vein (IV infusion).

The participants will take treatments in 4-week periods called cycles. They will take regorafenib once a day for 3 weeks, then stop for 1 week. In each cycle, the participants will receive nivolumab one time. These 4-week cycles will be repeated throughout the trial. The participants can take nivolumab and regorafenib until their cancer gets worse, until they have medical problems, or until they leave the trial. The longest nivolumab can be given is up to 2 years.

During the trial, the doctors will take pictures of the participants' tumors using CT or MRI and will take blood and urine samples. The doctors will also do physical examinations and check the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG). They will ask questions about how the participants are feeling and if they have any medical problems.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Regorafenib, (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)|DRUG: Nivolumab (Opdivo)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Tumor response was evaluated as ORR per RECIST 1.1 by local assessments for all tumor types, except for GBM/AA, where ORR per RANO by local assessment was used. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Participants for whom best overall tumor response was not CR or PR, as well as participants without any post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. Descriptive statistics were done, no inferential statistical analyses were performed., From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 months
Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time (in days) from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever is noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurs before progression is documented). DOR will be defined for responders only, i.e. participants with a CR or PR., From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), CR = Complete response; PR = Partial response; SD = Stable disease, From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in days) from the start of study intervention to the date of first objectively documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause (if no progression was documented)., From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 months|6 Months PFS, 6 Months PFS rate, Up to last participant follow 6 months (approximately 22 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in days) from the start of study intervention to the date of death due to any cause., From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 months|1 Year OS, From first participant enrolled to cut-off date (ie after the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months) approximately 26 month]|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, AEs were considered to be treatment-emergent (TEAEs) if they started or worsened after the start of first study drug administration until 30 days after regorafenib treatment discontinuation or 100 days after the last dose of nivolumab, whatever occurred later., Up to the last participant has been followed for approximately 10 months, summed up to approximately 26 months
