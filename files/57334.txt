The purpose of this study is to:

* evaluate if there is an association between elevated levels of cytokines and chronic pain due to herniated disk disease
* measured cytokines levels in chronic low back pain and in healthy subjects.
Interleukines
OTHER: blood collect
cytokines levels in patients with chronic low back pain and in healthy subjects, 30 days after collect
23 patients with at least three months of back pain due to herniated disk disease were selected Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the spine for all patients. In addition, pain severity had to be Â³ 5 points on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).
