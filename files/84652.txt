HAIC+Lenvatinib+Tislelizumab vs D-TACE+Lenvatinib+Tislelizumab for Unresectable HCC
Drug-eluting Bead-Transarterial chemoembolization (D-TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of D-TACE for patients in Advanced Unresectable HCC. The investigators previous study also revealed similar results in Advanced Unresectable HCC patients treated with D-TACE. Recently, the investigators previous study demonstrated that, compared with D-TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve tumor response in Advanced Unresectable HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective nonrandomized control to demonstrate the superiority of HAIC-based combination therapy over D-TACE-based combination therapy.

Tumor Response, The tumor responses were evaluated by measuring the longest diameter of target lesions according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors.(RECIST) version 1.1, 6-8 weeks|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was measured from the initiation of transarterial therapy to the date of death or the last follow-up., 24months|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the initiation of transarterial therapy to the time of progression or recurrence or last follow-up, 24 months|Cancer embolism withdraws, The degree of thrombosis withdrawal of the portal vein or hepatic vein(VP1-VP4 or I-IV)., 6-8 weeks
HCC is one of the most common malignant tumors with the worst prognosis. At present, except for liver transplantation, surgical resection is the most effective therapy for patients with HCC. However, many patients are found to have advanced cancer as soon as they were diagnosed and lose the opportunity of radical resection and treatments are limited.More and more clinical research failures have hit the investigators' hard, until a clinical study named IMbrave150, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020. It has opened up a new era of combination therapy, breaking the pattern of only a single mode of advanced liver cancer for more than ten years, making the investigators realize that for the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer, the single treatment effect is often very limited, and combination therapy is the future.The investigators recent research showed that HAIC Combined With Lenvatinib and Tislelizumab brings good results to patients with advanced HCC.To identify a more effective and safety way for treating potentially resectable HCC patients, this study is designed to compare the safety and efficacy between HAIC-based combination therapy and D-TACE-based combination therapy for those patients in Advanced Unresectable HCC.
