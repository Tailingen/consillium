A Clinical Study With MT-102 in Subjects With Cancer Cachexia
A phase II clinical study to evaluate MT-102 administered over a sixteen week period in subjects with cachexia related to non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer
Cancer Cachexia
DRUG: MT-102
Demonstrate the effect of a 10mg / bd dose of MT-102 in comparison to placebo on the rate of weight change over a sixteen week period in patients with cachexia related to underlying stage III and stage IV colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer, 16 weeks
Cachexia is a wasting disease, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, accompanying a wide range of serious illnesses, for which there are currently no widely approved therapeutic agents. Cachexia is defined as weight loss, associated with a chronic underlying disease, of at least 5% in 12 months or less. It is associated with fatigue, loss of muscle strength, a low fat free index and neurohormonal and biochemical abnormalities.

Cancer cachexia occurs in about a third of all patients with cancer and has been estimated to be the direct cause of death in up to 20% of all cancer related deaths. As with other solid tumours, colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have relatively high incidences of cachexia, approximately 28% and 34% respectively.Through its combined pharmacological actions, MT-102 has a multi-functional effect upon three potential pharmacological targets, each of which is relevant for cancer cachexia
