The Utility of Cell-free Methylation Markers in Blood for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Patients with liver cancer expected to undergo radiofrequency ablation or transvascular embolization. Relevant tumor markers (AFP and methylation analysis) were performed. The two data are then counted and compared.
Serum Tumor Markers
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Met-score
Evaluate efficacy (methylation profiling results), Correlation of methylation profiling results with AFP and tumor treatment response., 3 month after treatment
The subjects of this study were patients who were diagnosed with liver cancer by physicians based on AASLD clinical criteria or pathological biopsy.

Patients are those who received radiofrequency ablation or transvascular embolization in National Taiwan University Hospital. Which excludes weakness and inability to cooperate Patients with blood test, under the condition of fully informed consent, complete blood test related tumor indicators (AFP and methylation analysis).
