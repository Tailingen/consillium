Bortezomib, Thalidomide, and Dexamethasone After Melphalan and Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Stage I-III Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Bortezomib and thalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bortezomib together with thalidomide and dexamethasone may kill any cancer cells that remain after high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant in patients with multiple myeloma.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving bortezomib together with thalidomide and dexamethasone after melphalan and stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I-III multiple myeloma.

Defined as the percentage of patients alive at year one after starting treatment., From date of treatment initiation until death from any cause, assessed up to one year.
Count of Response in Patients Started on Maintenance Therapy, Complete Response (CR): Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100mg per 24-h.

Partial Response (PR): \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by \> 90% or to \< 200mg per 24-h In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a . 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required.

Stable Disease (SD): Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease.

Relapse: Any of the following: Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by immunofixation or electrophoresis Development of \> 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow. Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, lytic bone lesion), Post-Thalidomide at 1 year.|One Year Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Defined as the percentage of patients progression-free at year one after starting treatment.

International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria for disease progression:

Increase of \> 25% from baseline in Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 0.5 g/dl); Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 200 mg/24 h; Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels:

the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase must be \>l0mg/dl.

Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be \> 10%C; Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.

or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/l) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder., From start of treatment initiation until disease progression, relapse or death from any cause, assessed up to 1 year.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the feasibility and toxicities of maintenance therapy with sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone after high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.
* To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can improve progression-free survival of these patients.

Secondary

* To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can increase complete remission rate and duration of response in these patients.
* To assess the impact of maintenance therapy with sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone after transplantation on overall survival of these patients.
* To evaluate the influence of cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g., chromosome 13 deletion, 14 q32 abnormality, t \[4;14\], chromosome 1 q21 amplification, and chromosome 17 deletion) on outcome by performing conventional cytogenetic study and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on baseline and post-transplant bone marrow specimens.

OUTLINE:

* High-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1 and undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.
* Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4-8 weeks after transplantation, patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4; treatment with dexamethasone repeats every month for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 weeks after completion of bortezomib, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily until disease progression.

Patients complete the FACT-GOG neurotoxicity questionnaire periodically. Bone marrow samples are collected at baseline and post-transplant for cytogenetic analysis by FISH.
