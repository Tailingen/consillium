Serial [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG )PET/CT as a Biomarker of Therapeutic Response in Anti-PD1/PDL1 Therapy
Evaluation of FDG PET/CT to image immunotherapy response in adult thoracic cancer.

Compare pre- and post-treatment primary tumor uptake for FDG-PET/CT and correlate with clinical markers of response. PET/CT tumor metabolic response will also be correlated will to progression-free survival and overall survival.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
RADIATION: [18F]fluoroglucose(FDG)
Number of inflammatory changes within the tumor, 2 years
Evaluation of FDG PET/CT to image immunotherapy response in adult thoracic cancer.

Compare pre- and post-treatment primary tumor uptake for FDG-PET/CT and correlate with clinical markers of response. PET/CT tumor metabolic response will also be correlated will to progression-free survival and overall survival.
