Safety and Immunogenicity of Prime-boost Vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 in Patients With Cancer
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a global pandemic since late 2019 that resulted in more than 360 million population infection. Patients with cancers may be at higher risk of infection and severity than those without cancer. Mass vaccination has been carried out, but reinfection and vaccine breakthrough cases still occur. Now, the prime-boost regimen was identified safe and efficient, but the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccine strategy in cancer patients were not known.

This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. A total of 100 patients with different cancers including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were included in this heterologous prime-boost vaccination study. All of the patients will further accept 12 months follow-up study after prime-boost vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the prime-boost vaccination in those patients will be carefully recorded and detected.
