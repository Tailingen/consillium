TAA06 Injection in the Treatment of Patients With B7-H3-positive Relapsed/ Refractory Neuroblastoma
Phase I clinical trials are designed as open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical studies, the main purpose of which is to explore the tolerability, safety, cytokinetic characteristics and RP2D and preliminary observation of the efficacy of the study drug in subjects with B7-H3-positive relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.
B7-H3-positive Relapsed/ Refractory Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: T cell injection targeting B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor
MTD, Maximum tolerated dose of TAA06 Injection in subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, about 3 years|RP2D, Phase 2 recommended dose of TAA06 Injection in subjects with relapsed/refractory, about 3 years|Assessment of the safety after B7-H3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells infusion (Safety), Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) ,(according to the evaluation criteria for common adverse events, NCICTCAE version 5.0), about 3 years
Assessment of pharmacokinetic (about Cmax), Assessment of the highest concentration (Cmax) of B7-H3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells amplified in peripheral blood after administration., about 3 years|Assessment of pharmacokinetic (about Tmax), Assessment of the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax) of B7-H3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells amplified in peripheral blood after administration., about 3 years|Assessment of pharmacokinetic (about AUC0-28d), Assessment of the area under the curve AUC0-28d after administration., about 3 years|Assessment of pharmacokinetic (about AUC0-90d), Assessment of the area under the curve AUC0-90d after administration., about 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and maintained for a certain period of time , including Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) cases.（According to the evaluation standard of solid tumor effect (RECISTv1.1)）, about 3 years|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, The proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable for a certain period of time , including Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD) cases.（According to the evaluation standard of solid tumor effect (RECISTv1.1)）, about 3 years|Duration of Response（DOR）, The time from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the time of death of PD (ProgressiveDisease) or any cause.（According to the evaluation standard of solid tumor effect (RECISTv1.1)）, about 3 years|Progression-free Survival（PFS）, The time from start of B7-H3 CAR-T cell therapy to the first occurrence of disease progression or death of any cause.（According to the evaluation standard of solid tumor effect (RECISTv1.1)）, about 3 years|To Evaluate Anti-tumour Activity (Overall Survival), Defined as the time from start of B7-H3 CAR-T cell therapy to death (due to any cause), about 3 years|Immunogenicity endpoints, Positive rate of human anti-CAR antibody at each time point., about 3 years
In the dose-escalation phase of the Phase I clinical trial, a traditional 3+3 trial design was adopted, with a total of 3 dose groups designed. The dose of T/kg was gradually increased, and a total of 12-18 subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma were enrolled.Within each dose group, the next subject can be dosed after the previous subject has completed at least 14 days of safety observations. After the last subject of each dose group completed the dose-limited toxicity (DLT) evaluation within 28 days after a single dose, the SMC (Safety Monitoring Committee) agreed to enter the next dose group after evaluating the clinical safety data. After that, the enrolment treatment for the next dose group can be started.When 1 DLT occurs in 3 subjects in a dose group, 3 additional subjects in the same dose group (up to 6 subjects in this dose group complete the DLT assessment): If the additional 3 subjects If no DLT occurs, continue dose escalation; if 1 out of 3 additional subjects develops DLT, stop dose escalation; if \&gt; 1 of 3 additional subjects develops DLT DLT, then stop the dose escalation, and at the same time need to reduce a dose to continue to enroll 3 subjects for DLT evaluation.

In the dose expansion phase of the Phase I clinical trial, SMC will review the obtained safety and available data on efficacy, PK, immunogenicity, etc., and give the RP2D dose after comprehensive evaluation. In the dose expansion phase, the RP2D dose group will continue to be enrolled 3 \~6 subjects, further clarify the preliminary efficacy and safety of RP2D.
