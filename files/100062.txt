A Phase 1 Study of Brentuximab Vedotin Combined With Multi-Agent Chemotherapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in treatment-naive Stage IIa or IIb-IV Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a phase 1, two-arm, open-label dose escalation study designed to define the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in combination with frontline therapy.
