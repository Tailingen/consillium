Efficacy and Safety Study of SyB L-0501 for Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficacy of SyB L-0501 after 2-day intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: SyB L-0501
Response Rate [Complete Remission (CR) +Complete Remission / Incomplete (CRi) + Nodular Partial Remission (nPR) + Partial Remission (PR)] Based on International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Guideline, The criteria for CR, CRi, nPR and PR based on IWCLL guideline are shown below. For the criteria for nPR and PR, please refer to the description of NCI-WG response rate (CR+nPR+PR).

CR: Assessment should be made at least 8 weeks after completion of administration.

1. Absence of significant lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes greater than 1.5 cm in diameter)
2. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
3. Absence of B symptoms
4. Meet the following laboratory test values;

   * lymphocyte count in peripheral blood: \<4.0×10\^9/L
   * neutrophil count: \>1.5×10\^9/L
   * platelet count: 100×10\^9/L
   * hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL without transfusions
5. less than 30% of nucleated cells are lymphocytes (confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and no lymphoid nodules).
6. No new lesion emergence

CRi: Fulfills all of the following criteria

* Delayed anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia is observed.
* Fulfills all CR criteria other than 4).
* Delayed symptoms are all judged to be caused by drug., Up to 30 months
National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) Response Rate (CR+nPR+PR) Based on IWCLL Guideline, The criteria for nPR and PR based on IWCLL guideline are shown below.

nPR: Fulfills all CR criteria other than residual lymphoid nodules confirmed by bone marrow examination.

PR: Fulfills two or more items from Group A and one or more items from Group B for a minimal duration of 8 weeks.

Group A;

1. 50% or greater reduction in lymphocyte count in peripheral blood from baseline
2. 50% or greater reduction (size reduction) in Sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD) and no new lesion emergence or no new enlarged lymph node
3. A decrease in the size of the liver and/or spleen by 50% more
4. A decrease in marrow infiltration or lymphoid nodules by 50% more Group B;

1) Neutrophil count \>1.5×10\^9/L or 50% improvement from baseline 2) Platelet count \>100×10\^9/L or 50% improvement from baseline 3) Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement from baseline without transfusions, Up to 30 months|Complete Remission Rate (CR+CRi) Based on IWCLL Guideline, Up to 30 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The period from the first day of the study drug administration (Day1) to progressive disease (PD), recurrence/relapse, or death., Up to 30 months|Duration of Remission, The period from the day of CR or PR confirmation to recurrence/relapse., Up to 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), The period from the date of patient registration to the date of death., Up to 30 months|Adverse Events, All undesirable medical events experienced by the subject treated with the investigational product (including abnormal changes in laboratory values) are treated as adverse events and evaluated for safety., Up to 30 months|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Laboratory Test Values of Grade 3 or More, Abnormalities in laboratory test values in overall study period were analyzed. Severity of abnormalities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). grade 1 : mild grade 2 : moderate grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening grade 4 : life threatening or disabling grade 5 : death related to adverse event, Up to 30 months|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Physical Examination Values, Number of subjects with abnormal or severe values of vital signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examination including ECOG performance status, Up to 30 months
