Feasibility of Acquiring Hyperpolarized Imaging in Patients With Meningioma
This is a Pilot/Phase I clinical study of hyperpolarized 13C (HP 13C) pyruvate injection that includes the acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) data performed on participants with meningioma to evaluate metabolism and aid in the non-invasive characterization of aggressive tumor behavior
Meningioma
DRUG: Hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)|OTHER: Saline
Proportion of participants who complete 13C pyruvate MR imaging., All participants who are enrolled in the study and receive any amount of hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate will be included in the primary outcome analysis. The proportion of participants who complete hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MR imaging will be reported. If the proportion is greater than 0.7, hyperpolarized 13C MR imaging will be determined to be feasible., Day of MR imaging (1 day)
Best Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging protocol ("measurement") to detect altered pyruvate-to-lactate cell metabolism, Five initial patients will be evaluated to establish the spatial and temporal resolution and coverage that yields the best signal amplitudes and time dynamics for measuring tumor pyruvate-to-lactate will be identified., Day of MR imaging (1 day)|Best Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging protocol ("measurement") to detect altered pyruvate-to-alanine cell metabolism, Five initial patients will be evaluated to establish the spatial, temporal resolution and coverage that yield the best signal amplitudes and time dynamics for measuring tumor pyruvate-to-alanine will be identified., Day of MR imaging (1 day)|Best Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging protocol ("measurement") to detect altered pyruvate-to-bicarbonate cell conversion, Five initial patients will be evaluated to establish the spatial and temporal resolution and coverage that yield the best signal amplitudes and time dynamics for measuring tumor pyruvate-to-bicarbonate conversion will be identified., Day of MR imaging (1 day)|Mean of pyruvate-to-lactate, The mean and standard deviations of pyruvate-to-lactate ratio will be reported., Day of MR imaging (1 day)|Mean of pyruvate-to-alanine, The mean and standard deviations of pyruvate-to-alanine ratio will be reported., Day of MR imaging (1 day)|Mean of pyruvate-to-bicarbonate conversion, The mean and standard deviations of pyruvate-to-bicarbonate conversion rate will be reported., Day of MR imaging (1 day)
Primary Objective:

I. To assess the feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR imaging as a new and unique tool in the characterization of aggressive tumor behavior in participants with meningioma.

Secondary Objectives:

I. To define the most appropriate parameters for obtaining hyperpolarized 13C data from meningioma patients with a run-in study to optimize spatial and temporal resolution and coverage by detecting signal amplitudes and time dynamics.

II. To measure tumor pyruvate-to-lactate, pyruvate-to-alanine, and pyruvate-to-bicarbonate conversion by 13C pyruvate MR imaging in participants with meningioma planning to undergo surgical resection within 4 weeks, using parameters.

Outline:

Participants will receive a single imaging procedure using HP 13C pyruvate. Participants will then be followed-up for 30 days after completion of the study or until voluntary withdrawal or death.
