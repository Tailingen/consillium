Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the time from the date of informed consent to the earlier of death or disease progression. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Equivocal progression of non-target lesions also qualifies as PD., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Overall Survival (OS), It is defined as the time from the start of treatment to death for any reason., It is defined as the time from the start of treatment to death for any reason, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR relative to the appropriate analysis set, From date of observation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events, Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry). AE grade were defined by the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events)., From date of observation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Body mass index (BMI) is strongly associated with the development and progression of breast cancer. Despite the widespread use of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy (ET) in hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer, the effect of BMI on therapeutic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we present real-world evidence to substantiate the association between BMI and CDK4/6 inhibitors efficacy and safety.
