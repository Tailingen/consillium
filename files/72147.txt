19(T2)28z1xx Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells in People With B-Cell Cancers
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of 19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells in people with relapsed/refractory B-cell cancers. The researchers will try to find the highest dose of 19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells that causes few or mild side effects in participants. Once they find this dose, they can test it in future participants to see if it is effective in treating their relapsed/refractory B-cell cell cancers. This study will also look at whether 19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells work against participants' cancer.

DRUG: 19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells
Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), Dose escalation will use a 3+3 design. DLT-evaluable participants are defined as those participants who were infused with 19(T2)28z1XX CAR T cells and who were monitored for toxicities during the first 28 days of post infusion., 28 days post infusion
overall response rate (ORR), Response and progression of the disease will be evaluated in this study using the Lugano Classification, 2 years
