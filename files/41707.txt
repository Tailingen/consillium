Delineation of Reducing Clinical Target Volume for Early-stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients
To analyze the long-term results and toxicities of the reducing clinical target volume (CTV) delineation method in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

The investigators designed a prospective phase II study for early-stage NPC patients, and proposed a reasonable delineation method of reducing CTV according to the clinical characteristics and tumor infiltration patterns, performing therapeutic dose to tumor and prophylactic dose to CTV while protecting as much normal tissues as possible, in order to ensure a long-term survival with good quality of life.
