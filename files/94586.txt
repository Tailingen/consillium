Treatment of Elderly Chinese Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Aged 65 to 75 Years Old
This study focus on the comparison of CAG regimen to the low dose cytarabine therapy in elderly AML patients who are unfit or unwilling to receive intensive chemotherapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: CAG regimen (Aclacinomycin, cytarabine, with/w/o G-CSF)|DRUG: low dose cytarabine
overall survival, 3 years
complete remission rate, 4 months|relapse free survival, 3 years|treatment-related mortality, 2 months
Low dose cytarabine remains to be the choice of standard for elderly AML patients who are unfit or unwilling to receive intensive treatment. CAG regimen, which is a combination of aclacinomycin，low dose cytarabine±G-CSF is used often in elderly AML patients in China. It is proved effective and safety in some pilot studies，while there is no prospective，randomized study yet.
