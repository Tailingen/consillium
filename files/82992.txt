Comparison of 5-ALA Photodynamic Therapy and CO2 Laser for Treating Persistent Low-Grade Cervical Lesions With High-Risk HPV Infection
Non-RCT clinical trial comparing 5-ALA photodynamic therapy and CO2 laser for persistent high-risk HPV-related low-grade cervical lesions.

PROCEDURE: CO2
Regression of Cervical Lesions., Measure the rate of regression in cervical lesions after three PDT sessions., Assessed at 6 months after the last PDT session.
Adverse Events., Monitor and document any adverse events or complications related to CO2 laser treatment., Evaluated at 6 months after the CO2 laser treatment.
This non-randomized controlled trial aims to compare the effectiveness of two treatments, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) photodynamic therapy and CO2 laser, for women with persistent low-grade cervical lesions associated with high-risk HPV infection lasting more than one year. The study's primary objective is to assess which treatment option yields better results. Participants in both groups will undergo specific therapeutic procedures, including 5-ALA photodynamic therapy or CO2 laser treatment. The study will analyze and compare the effects of these therapies on the regression or elimination of cervical lesions, offering valuable insights into the management of persistent low-grade cervical lesions among high-risk HPV-infected women.
