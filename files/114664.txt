Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Two Dosing Regimens of Olokizumab (OKZ), Compared to Placebo, in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Were Taking an Existing Medication Called a Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitor But Had Active Disease
The purpose of this study was to determine how effective and safe the study drug Olokizumab was in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who had been already receiving, but not fully responding to treatment with an existing medication called a tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of olokizumab (OKZ) 64 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) once every 2 weeks (q2w) or once every 4 weeks (q4w) relative to placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inadequately controlled by TNF-α inhibitor (TNFi) therapy.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: Olokizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Subjects Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response, The difference between OKZ and placebo in the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12. A responder is defined as any subject satisfying ACR20 criteria and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12.

American College of Rheumatology 20 % response is a composite defined as a ≥ 20% improvement from baseline in the swollen joint counts assessed in 66 joints and in the tender joint count assessed in 68 joints; and a ≥20% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures:

* Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS)
* Patient Assessment of Pain (VAS)
* HAQ-DI
* Physician Global Assessment (VAS)
* Level of acute phase reactant (CRP), at Week 12
Percentage of Subjects Achieving Low Disease Activity, Defined as Disease Activity Score 28-joint count (DAS28) C-reactive protein (CRP) \<3.2, and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12, at Week 12|Improvement of Physical Ability From Baseline to Week 12, as Measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Change of physical ability from baseline (the last available assessment prior to the first dose of the study treatment) to week 12, as measured by HAQ-DI. The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20 questions.The domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities, and each domain consists of 2 or 3 items. For each question, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0 = without any difficulty (the best outcome), 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do (the worst outcome). Each category is given a score by taking the maximum score of each question. A decrease from baseline indicates improvement for HAQ-DI.The HAQ-DI was calculated by dividing the sum of the category scores by the number of categories with at least 1 question answered. The HAQ-DI total score ranges from 0 (the best outcome) to 3 (the worst outcome)., Baseline to Week 12|Percentage of Subjects Achieving American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) Response, Difference between OKZ and placebo in the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR50 response and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12.

American College of Rheumatology 50% Response is a composite defined as ≥50%, improvement from baseline in the swollen joint counts assessed in 66 joints and in the tender joint count assessed in 68 joints; and a ≥50%, improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures:

* Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS)
* Patient Assessment of Pain (VAS)
* HAQ-DI
* Physician Global Assessment (VAS)
* Level of acute phase reactant (CRP), at Week 12|Percentage of Subjects With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≤ 2.8 (Remission), Difference between OKZ and placebo in the percentage of subjects with Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≤2.8 (remission) and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12, at Week 12
The goal of this Phase III study was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who had responded inadequately to TNFi therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was assessed at Week 12. Olokizumab was expected to reduce the disease activity and improve physical function. The study was expected to provide safety information in a large group of subjects over at least a 24 week period.

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study included a 4-week Screening Period, a double-blind Treatment Period from Week 0 to Week 24, and a Safety FollowUp Period from Week 24 to Week 44.

A total of 350 subjects were planned to be randomized.Subjects were assessed for eligibility to enter the study during a 4-week Screening Period. Eligible subjects were randomized at Visit 2 in a 2:2:1 ratio in one of 3 treatment groups (planned 140, 140, and 70 subjects per group, respectively) :

1. Olokizumab 64 mg q4w: SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of placebo OKZ q4w to maintain blinding) + MTX for 24 weeks,
2. Olokizumab 64 mg q2w: SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w + MTX for 24 weeks or
3. Placebo: SC injection of placebo q2w + MTX for 16 weeks.

Subjects who received placebo were re-randomized at Week 16 to receive 64 mg OKZ q4w + Methotrexate or 64 mg OKZ q2w +Methotrexate for 8 weeks.

Throughout the double-blind Treatment Period, all subjects were required to remain on a stable dose of background MTX with a stable route of administration. Concomitant treatment with folic acid was required for all subjects. The last dose of OKZ was administered at Week 20 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q4w and at Week 22 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q2w.

Following Visit 2 (randomization; Week 0), subjects returned to the study site at least every 2 weeks through Week 24 for response and safety assessments.

At Week 14, subjects who did not improve by at least 20% in both swollen and tender joint counts were classified as nonresponders and were administered sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine as rescue medication in addition to the assigned treatment.

After completion of the 24-week double-blind Treatment Period, subjects either rolled over into the long-term open-label extension (OLE) study or entered the Safety Follow-Up Period. During the Safety Follow-Up Period, subjects returned for visits +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.

Subjects who discontinued randomized treatment prematurely were required to come for the End of Treatment (EoT) Visit 2 weeks after the last study treatment administration and then continue with the scheduled study visits.

Adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout the study (starting when the subject signed the informed consent form) and evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. There was ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by the Sponsor or the Sponsor's designee. In addition, safety was assessed throughout the study by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and potential major adverse cardiac events were evaluated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee.

The study was conducted at 123 sites across 11 countries globally (in US,EU, Russian Federation, Asia, Latin America)
