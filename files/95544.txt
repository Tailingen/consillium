Study Objective:

This clinical study focuses on patients with thyroid or airway diseases necessitating partial or segmental organ resection. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of transplanting functional patient-specific bioprinted tracheal organs as an innovative regenerative approach.

Patient Enrollment:

Patients voluntarily participate and provide written consent. A thorough screening procedure is conducted to determine their eligibility based on selection and exclusion criteria.

Bioprinting Process:

The study employs cutting-edge bioprinting technology to create complex organ tissues. Specifically, 3D cell printing is employed to fabricate a bioprinted tracheal organ. Stem cells derived from the human nasal cavity and nasal septum cartilage cells are integrated to form a cell-supporting body.

Transplantation Procedure:

Eligible patients receive transplantation of the functional patient-specific bioprinted trachea. The transplantation aims to restore tracheal functionality and address the unique challenges posed by thyroid and airway diseases.

Evaluation and Monitoring:

Following transplantation, a comprehensive assessment regimen is undertaken to evaluate both the effectiveness and safety of the procedure. This includes flexural laryngeal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scans, and laboratory tests.

Post-Transplant Measures:

To ensure the stability of the transplanted organ immediately after the procedure, neck fixing splints are employed to limit movement.

Thyroid Cancer Patients:

For patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer, a distinct follow-up protocol is established. A five-year observation period is implemented, extending beyond the standard follow-up for general cancer patients. Additional observations include thyroid ultrasound, Free T4, Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Thyroglobulin Antigen (Thyroglobulin Ag), and Anti-Thyroglobulin Antibody (Anti-TG Ab) tests conducted at the designated observation points.

This study seeks to contribute novel insights into the realm of regenerative medicine and enhance the understanding of patient-specific bioprinting technology as a potential solution for tracheal and airway diseases.
