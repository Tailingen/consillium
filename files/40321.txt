Study to Assess Adverse Events and Pharmacokinetics in Adult Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) and Other Solid Tumors, Receiving Intravenous (IV) Infusion of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) Alone or in Combination With Budigalimab or Bevacizumab
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and pharmacokinetics of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy and in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab,.

Bevacizumab is an approved product, while Budigalimab and Azirkitug (ABBV-514) are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of NSCLC, HNSCC, and other solid tumors. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different dose of Azirkitug (ABBV-514) in monotherapy and in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab. Approximately 512 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across approximately 80 sites worldwide.

Participants will receive Azirkitug (ABBV-514) as a monotherapy or in combination with Budigalimab or Bevacizumab as an Intravenous (IV) Infusion for an estimated treatment period of up to 2 years.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
