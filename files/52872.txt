PD-L1 Antibody + Bevacizumab With Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy for Advanced HCC
This is a single-arm, phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of PD-L1 antibody combined with bevacizumab and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastases.

Study Population: Patients with advanced HCC who have:

* Confirmed extrahepatic metastases
* No prior PD-L1 or bevacizumab therapy
* Age 18-75 years
* Child-Pugh A or B7 liver function
* ECOG performance status 0-1

Treatment Regimen:

* PD-L1 antibody: 1200mg every 3 weeks
* Bevacizumab: 15mg/kg every 3 weeks
* HAIC with FOLFOX regimen: Up to 6 cycles
* Treatment continues until disease progression or up to 24 months

Primary Endpoint:

-Objective Response Rate (ORR)

Secondary Endpoints:

* Disease Control Rate (DCR)
* Duration of Response (DOR)
* Progression-free Survival (PFS)
* Overall Survival (OS)
* Safety assessments
* Quality of life measurements

Study Design Details:

* Single-arm study using Simon's two-stage design
* First stage: 27 patients
* Second stage: 9 additional patients if first stage shows efficacy
* Total planned enrollment: 36 patients
* Study duration: October 2024 - July 2027

This study aims to evaluate whether adding HAIC to PD-L1 inhibitor plus bevacizumab immunotherapy can improve outcomes for advanced HCC patients with extrahepatic spread, who currently have limited treatment options. The trial will assess both efficacy and safety of this combination approach.
