Veltuzumab and Milatuzumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A phase I dose escalation study of veltuzumab and milatuzumab in relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL. The phase I study will be followed by a pilot phase II study.

Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) for Phase I Patients, Dose-limiting toxicity was assessed during induction therapy for phase I., up to 2 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)for Phase I Patients, Patients received a fixed dose of Veltuzumab IV 200 mg/m2 and Milatuzumab was dose escalated, up to 2 years|Overall Objective Response Rate, Per International Response Criteria (Cheson JCO 2007) for target lesions and assessed by CT, MRI or PET: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 2 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using International Response Criteria (Cheson JCO 2007), as a \>= 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or at least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules), or the appearance of new lesions., up to 2 years|Fcγ-receptor Polymorphism Response to Treatment, The relationship between overall response rate (ORR) and Fcy receptor status. A two-sided chi-square test or exact test with α = 0.05 will be used to test the homogeneity of the ORR among the three genotypes., up to 2 years|Quantitative T-, B-, and NK-cell Subsets Using Flow Cytometry, Quantitative T-, B-, and NK- cell subsets will be assessed using flow cytometry to quantify the percentage and absolute number of cells expressing CD4, CD8, CD56, CD16, CD19, and CD20 at screening, after induction, and prior to the start of therapy on day 1 week 12, day 1 week 28, and then every 4 months for one year., up to 1 year|Access Pharmacokinetics Through AUC0-∞ (Area Under Curve), Evaluation of pharmacokinetics (Pk) of veltuzumab and milatuzumab was performed for patients included in the trial. Statistically, descriptive data of PK parameters will be computed. Relationships between such parameters as dose and AUC, volume of distribution, clearance, and others will be evaluated, but be preliminary due to the small sample size., 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-does|Access Pharmacokinetics Through Cmax, Evaluation of pharmacokinetics of veltuzumab and milatuzumab was performed for patients included in the trial. Statistically, descriptive data of PK parameters will be computed. Relationships between such parameters as dose and AUC, volume of distribution, clearance, and others will be evaluated, but be preliminary due to the small sample size., 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-dose|Monitor Human Anti-veltuzumab Antibodies and Human Anti-milatuzumab (HAHA), Patients will be monitored for the development of human anti-veltuzumab antibodies and human anti-milatuzumab antibodies (HAHA)., up to 36 weeks
A phase I/II study of veltuzumab combined with milatuzumab in relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both agents are well-tolerated in early phase clinical testing with infusion reactions as the primary observed toxicity. Preclinical testing in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated single agent activity for both veltuzumab and milatuzumab. In mantle cell lymphoma cell lines and SCID mouse models, synergist effects were observed when milatuzumab was combined with rituximab. Veltuzumab has several advantages over rituximab including slower off-rates, shorter infusion times, higher potency, and improved therapeutic responses in animal models. Previous and ongoing clinical investigations support the concept of combining monoclonal antibodies in NHL.
