Effects of Propofol-dexmedetomidine on Immune Function in Patients With Cancer Larynx
The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical study is to compare between propofol and isoflurane on perioperative immune cell populations and function in patients undergoing total laryngectomy surgery.
Cancer Larynx|Total Laryngectomy
DRUG: Propofol group|DRUG: Isoflurane group
CD3 plasma level, Venous blood samples will be collected. The extracted venous blood samples will be mixed evenly in a special anti-coagulation test tube and stored in a refrigerator (at 4C).Flow cytometer will be used to detect the level of CD3+, for 7 days after procedure
Heart rate, Intraoperative heart rate changes, for 5 hours during the procedure|Blood pressure, Intraoperative blood pressure changes, for 5 hours during the procedure|Peripheral oxygen saturation measured with pulse oximetry, Intraoperative peripheral oxygen saturation changes as measured with pulse oximetry, for 5 hours during the procedure
The perioperative period might be a critical time in primary cancer surgery because many factors can affect whether recurrence, or metastasis , or elimination by the immune system.

Cancer surgery can induce an acute inflammatory response, due to local tissue damage and the shedding of malignant cells into the blood and lymphocytic circulation although meticulous surgical manipulation. Many evidences suggest that several factors during the perioperative period can affect the immune system.

These could be attributed to the surgery per se, pain, anxiety, hypothermia, blood transfusion, anesthetic technique, and anesthetic drugs .Impairment in the immune system may allow malignant cells to escape immuno-surveillance and metastasize in the perioperative period.As well as increase the risk of postoperative complications, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.

Previous retrospective clinical studies of both breast and prostate cancer surgery have suggested an association between anaesthetic technique and cancer recurrence.

However ,other retrospective trials on various forms of cancer have shown no such benefit.
