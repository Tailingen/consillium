Studying Gene Expression and Location in Samples From Patients With Brain Tumors
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to brain tumors.

PURPOSE: This research studies gene expression and location in samples from patients with brain tumors.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: genetic linkage analysis|GENETIC: microarray analysis|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Correlation of NEIL3 expression and/or nuclear localization with tumor type or grade with respect to degree of differentiation
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the expression and subcellular localization of nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3) in brain tumors.

OUTLINE: Tissue microarray samples are analyzed for NEIL3 expression and subcellular localization by immunohistochemical methods.
