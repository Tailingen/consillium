A Clinical Study of BCD-217 (Nurulimab + Prolgolimab) Followed by Anti-PD-1 Compared to Anti-PD-1 Monotherapy as First-Line Treatment in Subjects With Unresectable/Metastatic Melanoma
The aim of study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BCD-217 followed by prolgolimab monotherapy versus prolgolimab monotherapy as first-line therapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

This study is designed as a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

After the stratification procedure, subjects are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups:

* BCD-217 + placebo (4 doses) → prolgolimab (BCD-217 group)
* Prolgolimab + placebo (4 doses) → prolgolimab (BCD-100 monotherapy group)
