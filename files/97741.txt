A Study of Absorption, Metabolism, and Elimination CC-90010 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the absorption, metabolism, and elimination of CC-90010 and its metabolites following a single oral dose of radiolabeled CC-90010 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
