Breast cancer is divided according to the hormone receptors into either hormone receptor-positive tumors which are estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive). These tumors express hormone receptors. This means they have a lot of hormone receptors. Hormone receptor-negative tumors are estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) and progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative). These tumors donot express hormone receptors. This means they have few or no hormone receptors. About 70% to 80% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are hormone receptor- .al., 2017) (Wang et positive
