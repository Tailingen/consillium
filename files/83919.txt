Penpulimab in Combination With Cetuximab as First-line Treatment in R/M SCCHN
This trial is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm exploratory clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Penpulimab injection combined with cetuximab in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

DRUG: Penpulimab combined with cetuximab
Objective response rate, Defined as the percentage of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (i.e., CR + PR) evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 from the start of trial medication, 2 years

Based on the apparent efficacy and favorable safety profile of previous PD-1 and cetuximab combination therapy, Penpulimab (PD-1 antibody) combined with cetuximab in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN are used to assess the efficacy and safety of the regimen. Among them, Penpulimab (PD-1 antibody) is approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma who have received at least second-line systemic chemotherapy in China. Cetuximab is approved in China for first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic SCCHN in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs platinum and fluorouracil.

This study plans to enroll 48 patients with untreated recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who will receive Penpulimab injection combined with cetuximab. Cetuximab 500 mg/m2 without PD-1 drugs for 14 days prior to Cycle 1. Cetuximab Injection 500 mg/m2 and Penpulimab Injection 200 mg are intravenously infused on Day 1 (D1) of Cycle 1, with 2 weeks (14 days) as a cycle. Penpulimab will be administered for no more than 96 weeks (48 cycles), and cetuximab will be administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal decision by the subject.
