PDO/PDO-TIL/PDOTS for Drug Screen
This clinical trial aims to use the patient-derived organoid (PDO), Patient-derived organoids-tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte coculture system (PDO-TIL) and patient-derived organotypic tissue spheroids (PDOTS) to simulate the tumor microenvironment in cancer patients. The culture system can be used for pre-clinical validation of drugs and screening of drugs to treat sensitive people and provide individualized treatment for patients with liver cancer. This model is used to explore the molecular mechanism of drug resistance and to find intervention strategies to further improve the response rate of drugs. This study is expected to provide an ideal platform for drug screening and drug resistance research in liver cancer patients, which can replace experimental animal models, and guide personalized medication for liver cancer patients, so as to improve the overall prognosis of patients.
