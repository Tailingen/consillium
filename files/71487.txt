Study Design :

This open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more than one study site), first-in-human study consisting of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation and Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. Part 1 has been completed.

Part 2 new patient populations examine:

* Group F: Patients with NSCLC with documented NRG1 fusion
* Group G: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented NRG1 fusion

For these new patient populations, Part 2 will further characterize the safety and tolerability of the selected dose level of zenocutuzumab (MCLA-128), as well as assessment of CBR, defined as the proportion of patients with a CR, PR or durable SD (SD for at least 24 weeks in duration). For the new patient populations, overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) will be described.

The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); Treatment period (treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow Up period (through 30 days after the last dose and quarterly checks for survival data for up to 2 years). Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.
