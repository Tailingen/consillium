Comparison of Cervical Cancer Screening Tests in HIV-infected Women in Lusaka, Zambia
This study will compare the test performance characteristics of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Xpert HPV, and OncoE6 in HIV-infected women, to inform the possible inclusion of these molecular tests in future cervical cancer screening
Cervical Cancer
DEVICE: Xpert HPV|DEVICE: OncoE6
Proportion of VIA-, Xpert HPV-, and OncoE6-positive results that are correctly identified, True positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) for CIN2+, once, at the enrollment visit|Proportion of VIA-, Xpert HPV-, and OncoE6-negative results that are correctly identified, True negative rate (i.e., specificity) for CIN2+, once, at the enrollment visit
This is a cross-sectional study taking place at cervical cancer prevention clinics in Lusaka, Zambia to determine the test performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) of (1) visual inspection with acetic acid, (2) Xpert HPV, and (3) OncoE6 for the detection of CIN2+ among HIV-infected women. All cervical screening tests will be evaluated against a gold standard of histopathology obtained from cervical biopsies.
