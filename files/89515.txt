A Phase II Study of Lonsurf (TAS-102) in Metastatic Platinum and Checkpoint Inhibitor-resistant Bladder Cancer
This study evaluates the clinical benefit of TAS-102 in participants with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are resistant to cisplatin or carboplatin front-line and checkpoint inhibitors as second line therapy. All participants will receive TAS-102 in oral form twice per day on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of each 28 day cycle.

Clinical benefit rate (complete response+ partial response+ stable disease), Evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 6 months
Progression-free survival rate (PFS) among participants, Evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 6 months|Overall response rate (ORR) among participants, Evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 12 months|Overall survival rate (OS) among participants, Evaluated per Medical Record, Up to 12 months|Overall change in patient-reported quality of life outcomes, Evaluated per Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bladder (FACT-Bl) version 4 - quality of life (QOL) questionnaire scores

* FACT-Bl total score range is 0-156, derived by the sum of the sub-scales. Higher scores indicate better QOL.
* FACT-Bl includes five sub-scales:

  * Physical Well-being (PWB), score range of 0-28
  * Social/Family Well-being (SWB), score range of 0-28
  * Emotional Well-being (EWB), score range of 0-24
  * Functional Well-being (FWB), score range of 0-28
  * Bladder Cancer Subscale (BlCS), score range of 0-48
* Note: Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from "4"., Up to 26 months|Proportion of participants with Grade 3 or higher Adverse and Serious Adverse Events, Evaluated per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, Up to 26 months
