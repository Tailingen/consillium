Anti-PD-1 Antibody Plus DEB-TACE for BCLC Stage A/B HCC
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the anti-programmed-death-1 antibody (anti-PD-1) Sintilimab Injection in combination with transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads(TACE-DEB) in patients with BCLC Stage A/B Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond the Milan Criteria.

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of BCLC stage A/B exceeding the Milan criteria have a low resection rate and high postoperative recurrence rate, therefore, optimizing therapy for these patients is an important unmet need. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of preoperative DEB-TACE plus sintilimab for the treatment of patients with BCLC stage A/B HCC exceeding the Milan criteria.
