Interpretations and Predictions of Patient Reported Outcomes by Breast Cancer Patients
This study will assess how patients' long-term quality of life after different surgical approaches compares to their predicted quality of life.
Breast Cancer
Predicted patient reported outcomes up to 1 year after, Predicted patient reported outcomes for each domain six-months and 1 year after breast surgery., 12 months|Actual patient reported outcomes for each domain after surgery, Actual PRO scores for each domain six-months after surgery, 6 month|Compare predicted and actual outcomes, Comparison of predicted versus actual PRO scores in patients undergoing surgery, 12 months|Patients preferred method of communicating results, Patients' preferred means of receiving and communicating PRO results., 12 months
This study will assess how patients' long-term quality of life after different surgical approaches compares to their predicted quality of life. It will also provide the research team with improved understanding of how patients interact with and prefer to receive QOL information. Improved understanding of patient predictions and perceptions of information display will allow us to incorporate predicted future PROs into the shared decision making process as well as allow us to provide this important information to patients in a meaningful way.
