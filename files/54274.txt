A Study to Identify Barriers to Cellular Therapies for People With Plasma Cell Disorders
This is an observational study that will include both participants with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma and their doctors. The purpose of this study is to gather information about the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation/HCT and B-cell maturation antigen /BCMS targeted chimeric antigen receptor/CAR autologous T-cell therapy.
