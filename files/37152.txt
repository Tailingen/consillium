Study of Ramucirumab, Trastuzumab and Paclitaxel in Patients With HER2-positive Recurrent/Metastatic Gastric Cancer (HER-RAM Study)
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed or amplified in 10-20% of gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Trastuzumab combined with fluorouracil and platinum has been established as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. The role of trastuzumab in second-line treatment for HER2-positive gastric cancer has not yet been addressed. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding trastuzumab to ramucirumab and paclitaxel combination as a second-line treatment in HER2-positive gastric cancer progressed after trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy.
Recurrent/Metastatic Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab + Ramucirumab + Paclitaxel
Phase 1b: Maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and paclitaxel combination treatment in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, Phase 1b: During the first 4 weeks of treatment|Phase 2: Progression-free survival in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer receiving trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and paclitaxel combination treatment, Phase 2: At 24 weeks after start of treatment
Overall survival, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate according to RECIST 1.1, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Safety and tolerability based on incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.02, Throughout the overall study period as well as up to 3 months after the last dose study treatment for each subject
