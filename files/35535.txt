Hypotension Prediction Effect on AKI
It is a single-center randomized controlled trial that aims to figure out the effect of the hypotension prediction index (HPI) on the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) after radical cystectomy. The primary hypothesis is that HPI software guidance prevents postoperative AKI by reducing the duration and severity of intraoperative hypotension (IOH).

DEVICE: BP management with HPI guidance
Acute kidney injury, Occurrence of acute kidney injury after radical cystectomy, Seven day after the operation
Depth and duration of hypotension, Depth and duration of hypotension will be assessed by calculating time weighted average (TWA) of hypotension under mean arterial pressure under 65 mmHg during the operation, From applying HPI (hypotension prediction index) monitor to the arterial line to the end of the anesthesia|Hypotension prediction index, Time weighted average of hypotension prediction index during the operation, From applying HPI (hypotension prediction index) monitor to the arterial line to the end of the anesthesia
