Viral Specific T-Lymphocytes to Treat Infection With Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr Virus in Patients With Compromised Immunity
The primary purpose of this phase I/II study is to evaluate whether partially matched, â‰¥2/6 HLA-matched, viral specific T cells have efficacy against adenovirus, CMV, and EBV, in subjects who have previously received any type of allogeneic HCT or solid organ transplant (SOT), or have compromised immunity. Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes has shown promise in preventing and treating infections with adenovirus, CMV, and EBV. However, the weeks taken to prepare patient-specific products, and cost associated with products that may not be used limits their value. In this trial, we will evaluate viral specific T cells generated by gamma capture technology. Eligible patients will include HCT and/or SOT recipients, and/or patients with compromised immunity who have adenovirus, CMV, or EBV infection or refractory viremia that is persistent despite standard therapy. Infusion of the cellular product will be assessed for safety and efficacy.

If a subject shows a partial response, defined as a decrease in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or 50% improvement of clinical signs and symptoms, or no response, they are eligible to receive up to 4 additional cellular infusions from the same donor, at a minimum of 14-day intervals. If the same donor is no longer available, eligible, or appropriate, another donor may be considered for a maximum of 4 total cellular infusions at the discretion of the study PI and treating physician. A subject will not exceed a maximum of 5 total infusions from 2 donors.

Subjects are followed for 6 months post initial viral-specific T cell infusion. If subjects receive additional infusion(s), GvHD and adverse events will be followed for an additional 90 days from last infusion. Data may be abstracted from subjects' medical charts for an additional 1 year after most recent viral-specific T cell infusion.
