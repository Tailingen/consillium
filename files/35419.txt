Epcoritamab in Combination With Loncastuximab Tesirine in Relapsed/Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining Loncastuximab Tesirine with Epcoritamab is tolerable and effective for reducing and/or eliminating lymphoma cells in the body.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as the number of participants with complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR) as the best response. Response will be assessed according to Lugano 2014 criteria., Up to 36 months|Partial Metabolic Response (PMR) Rate, PMR rate is defined as the number of participants with partial metabolic response (PMR) as the best response according to Lugano 2014 criteria., Up to 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of treatment until disease progression or death, whichever is earlier. Participants who remain alive without progression will be censored at the last documented disease assessment date. Response will assessed according to Lugano 2014 criteria., Up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Alive participants will be censored at the last date known to be alive., Up to 36 months
