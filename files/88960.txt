A Study of the Advanced Adenocarcinoma of Stomach and Gastroesophageal Junction With Camrelizumab+SOX Control Camrelizumab+SOX+ Trastuzumab
Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: camrelizumab
Pathological complete response rate(pCR）, Refers to the absence of tumor cell residue in the primary tumor., up to 2 years
Disease-free survival, Defined as postoperative disease-free subjects, starting from the time of postoperative baseline imaging evaluation to the time of disease recurrence or death., up to 2 years|Overall survival, defined as the time from the first medication to the death of a subject from any cause after enrollment. For the subjects who survived at the last contact, their total survival will be deleted on the last contact day., up to 2 years|Major pathological response rate, The survival tumor cells in the resected specimen were ≤10%., up to 2 years|R0 resection rate, There was no macroscopic tumor at the surgical margin, and the tumor cells at the surgical margin were negative within 1mm under microscope., up to 2 years
To observe the efficacy, safety, postoperative pathological remission rate and survival benefit of patients with HER-2 positive locally advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal junction treated with camrelizumab+SOX combined with trastuzumab or not.
