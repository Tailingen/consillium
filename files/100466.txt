A Study to Evaluate MRG003 vs Cetuximab/Methotrexate in in the Treatment of Patients With RM-SCCHN
The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of MRG003 versus cetuximab/methotrexate as second/third line of therapy in patients with RM-SCCHN who have previously failed PD-1 (L1) inhibitors and platinum-based therapy.

Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportions of patients with a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR, and SD after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAE), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse events that are difficult to deal with in clinical drug research, Baseline to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment|Quality of Life (QOL) scores, Quality of Life is a concept of comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of life. It mainly refers to the assessment of individual physiological, psychological and social functions, which is an important indicator of the effectiveness of medical and health care services., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of MRG003 versus cetuximab/methotrexate as second/third line of therapy in patients with RM-SCCHN who have previously failed PD-1 (L1) inhibitors and platinum-based therapy. Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled, randomized, and stratified according to the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS, 0 vs 1) and prior treatment with anti-EGFR mAb (yes vs no). For patients in the control group, cetuximab will be selected as comparator if no prior treatment with anti-EGFR mAb; otherwise, methotrexate will be selected.

After signing the informed consent and screened per inclusion/exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be randomized at a ratio of 1 : 1 and treated with MRG003 (2.3 mg/kg, IV, d1, Q3W) or cetuximab (400 mg/m2 for the first week and 250 mg/m2 for subsequent weeks, QW) / methotrexate (40 mg/m2, IV, QW) until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy, or other reasons leading to treatment discontinuation as specified by protocol.
