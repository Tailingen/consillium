Regional Haemodynamic Changes in Radial Artery Assessment With Continuous Pulsed-wave Doppler Ultrasound
The objective of the trial was to evaluate velocity-associated parameters of pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound at induction, discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit and during inspiratory cough in addition to the consumption of phenylephrine during the operation in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery with three types of anaesthesia management.

DRUG: 0.5% ropivacaine paravertebral block|DRUG: 0.25% ropivacaine epidural block|DRUG: 0.5% ropivacaine local anaesthesia
The Change of end-diastolic velocity, The primary outcome was the end-diastolic velocity at 12 time points of anaesthesia induction among the three groups., baseline and 10 minutes after induction
pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound, other data related to pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound and acquired during anaesthesia induction, before leaving the PACU and during inspiratory cough, before leaving the PACU, up to 5 minutes|intraoperative consumption of phenylephrine, intraoperative consumption of phenylephrine, through study completion, an average of 3 hours
The objective of the trial was to evaluate velocity-associated parameters of pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound at induction, discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit and during inspiratory cough in addition to the consumption of phenylephrine during the operation in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery with three types of anaesthesia management. The patients in this trial were visited during the entire operation and just before leaving the post-anaesthesia care unit. Velocity-associated data related to pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound and the consumption of phenylephrine were collected.
