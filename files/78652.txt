Cost-Utility Analysis Hospital Versus Home in Multiple Myeloma
Bortezomib needs repetitive visits at hospital for injections. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) might be an attractive and suitable alternative in this situation.

This study aim to perform a cost-utility analysis of two different strategies in several HaH structures within the Grand Est region in France.

Cost therapy assessment, Cost therapy assessment including direct medical costs, non-medical costs and indirect costs, investigated from the French Health Insurance perspective and expressed in Euro., 10 months follow-up per patient|EQ-5D questionnaire, 10 months follow-up per patient|QLQ-C30 questionnaire, an oncology-specific instrument, 10 months follow-up per patient
Bortezomib is a standard therapy of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma and is also approved for relapsing disease, requiring the patients to travel to the outpatient-hospital (OH) once a week for several months. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) might be an attractive and suitable alternative in this situation.

This study aim to perform a cost-utility analysis of two different strategies in several HaH structures within the Grand Est region in France: exclusive hospital-based Bortezomib administration versus combined administration in both OH and HaH.
