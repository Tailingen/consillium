A Study to Compare Onivyde Manufactured at Two Different Production Sites in Adult Participants With Advanced Cancer in the Pancreas
The aim of this study is to compare Onivyde manufactured at two different production sites in adult participants with advanced cancer in the pancreas.

Adult participants with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will receive Test Product (TP) and Reference Product (RP) Onivyde in line with its approved indication. The order in which they receive them depends on the group to which they are randomly assigned, this will be referred to as the crossover phase.

The average study duration for each participant until end of crossover phase is estimated to be approximately 3 months. After completion of the crossover phase, participants who in the opinion of the investigator will benefit from the treatment will be offered to enter the extension phase where they will receive the commercial Onivyde (RP) until disease progression, withdrawal, unacceptable toxicity or death. Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a cancer that has spread (metastasized) beyond the area of the pancreas to other organs of the body.

Onivyde is approved for the treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV).
