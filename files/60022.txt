Everolimus With Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) With Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR) Subtype
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of investigator's choice of chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with everolimus, in treating patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype with PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway mutation, as the first-line treatment.

Progression-free survival (PFS), The interval from randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, which ever occurs first., Approximately 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1., Approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), The interval from date of first detection of objective response until the first occurrence of disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, which ever occurs first., Approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of participants with complete response, partial response, and stable disease for more than 4 weeks in which response can be evaluated., Approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), The interval from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Approximately 3 years|Safety and tolerability, Number of adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0 per each treatment arm, Approximately 3 years|Number of participants with patient reported outcome (PRO), A report directly from a patient about his or her health or life quality by EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire and 28 out of 30 items are scored on a 4-point Likert response scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much. The EORTC QLQ-C30 scale scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, whereas a high score for a symptom scale/single item represents a high level of symptomatology., Approximately 3 years
Eligible participants will be those diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative \[Immunohistochemistry (IHC) ER positive \<1% ) , progesterone receptor (PR) negative(IHC PR positive \<1% ) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative \[IHC 0 or +; or IHC ++, Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) -\], LAR subtype with PAM pathway mutation locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer, who have received no prior chemotherapy, targeted therapy or other treatments.

The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of investigator's choice (ICC) of chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, carboplatin, vinorelbine, or utidelone) either alone or in combination with everolimus. This study aims to see if everolimus plus chemotherapy allows patients to live longer without the cancer getting worse, or simply to live longer, compared to patients receiving investigator's choice of chemotherapy. This study is also looking to see how the treatment and the cancer affects patients' quality of life.
