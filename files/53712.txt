Sequential Immunochemotherapy Treatment with Pembrolizumab Plus Dendritic Cell (DC) Vaccine Followed by Trifluridine/Tipiracil Plus Bevacizumab in Refractory Mismatch-repair-proficient (pMMR) or Microsatellite-stable (MSS) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the clinical and the immunological activity of an innovative strategy with an induction combo immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab plus DC Vaccine) followed by a maintenance chemotherapy (FTD/TPI plus Bevacizumab) in patients with refractory MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), The primary endpoint is Overall Response Rate (ORR) of chemotherapy, defined as the percentage of patients experiencing partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, after starting the treatment with FTD/TPI plus Bevacizumab., 2 years
Progression free survival (PFS), Measured as the time from the start of the treatment with FTD/TPI plus Bevacizumab to the date of first progression, or the date of death from any cause, or the date of the last restaging in non-progressed patients, 2 years|Safety evaluation, All adverse events will be recorded during the observation period (i.e. from the day of the first DC vaccine dose administered in the induction phase up to 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy), will be reported and graded according to NCI CTCAE 5.0., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Measured from the start of the induction treatment until the date of death from any cause or the last date on which it was known that the patient was alive., 2 years|In vivo immunomonitoring through DTH test:, In vivo immunomonitoring through DTH test: DTH testing will be performed in all patients on day 0 (pre-treatment DTH), after the induction phase (post-combo immuno treatment DTH), after the maintenance phase, at the end of treatment and at disease progression. The diameter of induration/erythema observed after 24 hours is recorded according to the following scale: 0-5 mm grade 1, 6-10 mm grade 2, 11-20 mm grade 3, and \> 21 mm grade 4. As DTH reactivity to lower concentrations of the antigen(s) is strictly related to more intense antigen specific immune responses, score results will be normalized against the concentration itself and transformed into a 0-80 scale for analysis purposes. Best results obtained for each patient at any of the posttreatment DTHs, either for tumor homogenate or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), will be taken into account for data analysis (best normalized score)., 2 years|Characterization of patient's HLA class I immune response, The typing of the locus A-B-C-DR and DQA/DQB will be performed by the Genetic Laboratory by means of the sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe reverse hybridization (PCR-SSO) method. This information will be used to design patient's HLA restricted peptides for personalized functional in vitro immune assays (such as IFN-γ ELISPOT assay and INF-γ secretion assay), as well as for tetramer-guided peripheral monitoring of the antigen specific response. Moreover, statistical analysis will be conducted to correlate the strength of the recorded immunological response to the full HLA haplotype and the clinical outcome., 2 years|Characterization of patient's HLA class II immune response, The typing of the locus A-B-C-DR and DQA/DQB will be performed by the Genetic Laboratory by means of the sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe reverse hybridization (PCR-SSO) method.

Results will be analyzed by means of bioinformatics and statistical tools and correlated with all the relevant clinical parameters., 2 years|In situ characterization of pMMR mCRC through Next Generation Sequencing analysis, NGS approaches (WES and RNAseq analysis) together with in house available bioinformatics pipeline will be used to score the antigen/neoantigen expression in pre-treatment and, whenever available, post-treatment tissue.

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains an incurable disease characterized by a poor prognosis. Recently, in the global phase 3 SUNLIGHT (NCT04737187) study, adding Bevacizumab to Trifluridine/Tipiracil (FTD/TPI) in the treatment of refractory mCRC significantly improved overall survival. Therefore, this combination regimen is going to become the new standard of care for refractory mCRC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including Pembrolizumab, have shown excellent results in MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, and recent trials evaluating both concomitant and sequential chemoimmunotherapy in MSS/pMMR mCRC (in particular ATEZOTRIBE and MAYA trials), have shown promising results. Since 2001, we have treated more than 80 advanced melanoma patients with a tumor lysate loaded autologous DC vaccine, observing a clinical benefit of 54.1% and, more importantly, an ORR of 63.6% to subsequent chemotherapy, suggesting that immunotherapy might improve the activity of sequential chemotherapy. Moreover, our team has recently concluded the first step of 2 ongoing clinical studies with DC vaccine administration, in radically resected mCRC and metastatic mesothelioma patients - showing that the vaccine was safe and promoted immunological responses that allowed it to continue with patients enrollment.
