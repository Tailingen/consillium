Terminal half-life calculated by natural log 2 divided by λz., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 first dose|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to the 12 hour sampling time (AUC0-12) after single dose, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the 12 hour sampling time 12 at which the concentration of HS-10241 was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). AUC0-12 was to be calculated according to the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours post-dose on Day 1 first dose|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to the 24 hour sampling time (AUC0-24) after single dose, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the 24 hour sampling time 24 at which the concentration of Almonertinib was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). AUC0-24 was to be calculated according to the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 single dose|Objective response rate (ORR)- Part1, ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that was confirmed at a subsequent scan at least 4 weeks later, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From first dose until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 24 months.|Disease control rate (DCR), Objective response was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate disease control rate. Disease control was deﬁned as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response (confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease for at least 5 weeks)., From first dose until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response assessed by RECIST 1.1. Duration of response was defined as the time from when the criteria for CR or PR were first met to the occurrence of an objective disease progression (PD) or death., From first dose until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 24 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression of tumor was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate progression free survival. Progression-free survival was deﬁned as the time from date of ﬁrst dose until the documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause in the absence of progression (whichever occurred first), regardless of whether they subsequently received non-study anti-cancer therapy., From first dose until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall survival (OS)-Part 2, OS was defined as time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., From first dose until disease progression or withdrawal from study, assessed up to 24 months.
This is a phase Ⅰb, multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of HS-10241 administered orally in combination with Almonertinib in patients with EGFRm+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following prior EGFR-TKI therapy.

The study consist of two parts: Part 1 is the dose escalation period to observe the safety, tolerance, PK characteristics and preliminary anti-tumor activity, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum applicable dose (MAD) of combined administration; Part 2 is the dose expansion period to select appropriate doses in different target populations and further evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of combined administration, and determine the phase II recommended dose (RP2D).

All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Patients of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression once every 8 weeks, if the product is well tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better. Survival follow-up is recommended once every 12 weeks.
