Study of CHS-388 (Formerly Known as SRF388) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, first-in-human, dose-escalation and expansion study of CHS-388, a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-27, as a monotherapy and in combination in patients with solid tumors.

[Part A, Part B] Safety Analysis: Summary of adverse events (AEs) and based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), Safety and tolerability of CHS-388 will be assessed by summarizing adverse events (AEs) and will be based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs)., Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part B, Part C] Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHS-388, Serum concentrations of CHS-388 will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of CHS-388., Up to 24 months|[Part D] Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CHS-388 and toripalimab, Serum concentrations of CHS-388 and toripalimab will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of CHS-388 and toripalimab, Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part B] Pharmacodynamics of CHS-388 (pSTAT levels), Pharmacodynamics of CHS-388 will be evaluated in immune cell subsets via whole blood., Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part C] Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be estimated by the percentage of patients achieving a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST., Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D] Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first documented response (CR or PR) to documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria, or documented death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D] Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with CR, partial PR, or stable disease lasting a minimum of 12 weeks., Up to 24 months|[Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D] Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first treatment on study with study drug to documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria or death., Up to 24 months|[Part C, Part D] Serum concentration of EBI3, Serum will be collected to assess EBI3 correlation with outcomes., Up to 24 months|[Part C] Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to CHS-388, Serum will be collected and assessed for the development of ADAs to CHS-388., Up to 24 months|[Part D] Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to CHS-388 and toripalimab, Serum will be collected and assessed for the development of ADAs to CHS-388 and toripalimab., Up to 24 months|[Part C - NSCLC Cohort] Summary of adverse events (AEs) based on treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), Safety and tolerability of CHS-388 + pembrolizumab will be assessed by summarizing AEs and will be based on TEAEs., Up tp 24 months|[Part D] Summary of adverse events (AEs) based on treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), Safety and tolerability of CHS-388 + toripalimab will be assessed by summarizing AEs and will be based on TEAEs., Up tp 24 months
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation and expansion study of CHS-388, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-27, as a monotherapy and in combination in patients with solid tumors that will be conducted in 4 parts:

* Part A: CHS-388 monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of CHS-388 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
* Part B: CHS-388 monotherapy expansion cohorts will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of CHS-388 monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic ccRCC, advanced or metastatic HCC, and advanced or metastatic NSCLC in indication specific cohorts.
* Part C will evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, tolerability, and PK of CHS-388 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced RCC,HCC, or NSCLC.
* Part D will evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, tolerability, and PK of CHS-388 in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced NSCLC.
