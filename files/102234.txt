Evaluation of Hypertension Management and Cardiovascular Adverse Event Prevention in Patients With B-cell Malignancies Undergoing Treatment With Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, the HALT Study
This study evaluates the incidence and management of new and worsening high blood pressure in patients with B-cell cancers on BTKi treatment.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Hematopoietic and Lymphoid System Neoplasm|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 1-year MACE rates between patients with B-cell malignancies on BTKi with new or worsening HTN on optimal anti-HTN strategies will be compared with patients who do not develop HTN on BTKi., Up to 12 months
Incidence of new and/or worsening hypertension (HTN), Incidence of new or worsening HTN over 1 year of BTKi therapy will be recorded (defined as blood pressure (BP) increase to\>140 mmHg systolic or \> 90 mmHg diastolic)., Up to 12 months|Hemodynamic changes associated with new and/or worsening HTN, Impedance cardiography (ICG) changes from before to after BTKi initiation and anti-HTN therapy implication will be recorded to assess hemodynamic changes., Up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To prospectively define the incidence of new and/or worsening HTN in patients with B-cell malignancies on BTKi.

II. To identify the hemodynamic changes associated with new and/or worsening HTN in patients with B-cell malignancies on BTKi by impedance cardiography (ICG) and thereby to define the optimal anti-hypertensive strategies.

III. To compare 1-year MACE rates between patients with B cell malignancies on BTKi with new or worsening HTN on optimal anti-HTN strategies with patients who do not develop HTN on BTKis.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients attend hypertension clinic visits, undergo optional blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiograms, impedance cardiography testing and blood and urine sample collection and have medical records reviewed throughout study.
