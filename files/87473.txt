Studying Biomarkers as a Diagnostic Tool in Samples From Younger Patients With B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This clinical trial is studying biomarkers as a diagnostic tool in samples from younger patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finding specific biomarkers may help improve the treatment of patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
B-cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission|Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Replication-timing changes as a biomarker for further risk prediction by FISH, 2 months
STUDY SUBTYPE: Ancillary/Correlative

OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only

TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective

BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples with DNA

BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Fresh and frozen bone marrow cells

STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic samples banked at the COG Cell Bank

SAMPLING METHOD: Non-probability sample

OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether we can identify individuals within a specific sub-group of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients that will eventually recur.

II. To identify replication-timing changes as a biomarker for further risk prediction.

III. To identify differences between patients of similar subtype, and choose candidate differences to analyze by methods that are compatible with frozen samples.

OUTLINE:

Archived cell samples are analyzed for replication timing by flow cytometry, microarray, and single-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays. Replication-timing results among cases and controls are also analyzed.
