A Study to Find a Suitable Dose of BI 1821736 and Test Whether it Helps People With Advanced Cancer
This study is open to adults with advanced solid tumours. People with solid tumours for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists can take part.

The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 1821736 that people with advanced solid tumours can tolerate. BI 1821736 is a type of immunotherapy. It is a special virus that kills cancer cells and helps the immune system fight cancer. In this study, BI 1821736 is given to humans for the first time.

Participants receive BI 1821736 as an infusion into a vein about every 3 weeks for up to 3 months. Study doctors regularly check the participants' health and monitor the tumours. The doctors also take note of any unwanted effects that could have been caused by BI 1821736.
