Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - Effect Of Physical Exercise And Electroacupuncture
Hypothesis:

The overall hypothesis is that women with PCOS, both obese and non-obese, have larger adipocytes, altered metabolism and signs of inflammation in adipose tissue and that these changes are associated with high sympathetic nerve activity, hyperandrogenism hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance with progression to type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as psychological distress and reduced quality of life. Physical exercise and electro-acupuncture decrease high concentrations of androgens, induce regulare menstrual pattern, inhibits high sympathetic activity and restore the PCOS induced disturbances.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Electroacupuncture|PROCEDURE: Physical exercise|PROCEDURE: Untreated control
To measure if physical exercise and electro-acupuncture restores endocrine, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immunological disturbances related to sympathetic nerve activity as well as psychological distress and improve quality of life in women with PCOS., One year
Primary outcome: Changes in androgen concentrations and menstrual pattern

Secondary outcome: changes in sympathetic nerve activity, uterus peristalsis, ovarian morphology, adipose tissue related variables, insulin sensitivity, coagulation factors and health related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression.
