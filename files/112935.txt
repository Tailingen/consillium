A Study to Evaluate Participant and Healthcare Professional Reported Preference for Subcutaneous Atezolizumab Compared With Intravenous Atezolizumab Formulation in Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, cross-over study in adult participants with PD-L1-positive NSCLC. Two populations will be included: participants with resected Stage II, IIIA, and selected IIIB (T3-N2) NSCLC who have completed adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy without evidence of disease relapse/recurrence, and chemotherapy-na√Øve participants with Stage IV NSCLC. The study will evaluate participant- and healthcare professionals (HCP)-reported preference for atezolizumab subcutaneous (SC) compared with atezolizumab intravenous (IV).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Percentage of Participants Who Preferred Atezolizumab SC to Atezolizumab IV Assessed Using Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ), Participants preference was assessed based on the Question 1 of PPQ. Question 1 (All things considered, which route of administration did you prefer?) asks participants to report their preference for the route of administration (IV, SC, or no preference). A point estimate with associated 95% CI for the percentage of participants who preferred atezolizumab SC was calculated. Participants experiencing any of the following events: treatment withdrawal prior to eligibility for PPQ, or death without answering Question 1 of PPQ, or treatment not started; were excluded from the analysis set. Participants who answered Question 1 of the PPQ without having at least 2 consecutive administrations of treatment with each administration modality (SC and IV) were excluded from the analysis. Percentages have been rounded off., Cycle 6 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)
Number of Participants by Their Level of Satisfaction With Atezolizumab SC and Atezolizumab IV Assessed Using Therapy Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire - Subcutaneous (TASQ-SC) and Intravenous (TASQ-IV), TASQ is a 12-item, participant-reported questionnaire measuring the impact of each mode of treatment administration (TASQ-IV for IV treatment and TASQ-SC for SC treatment) on five domains: Physical Impact, Psychological Impact, Impact on Activities of Daily Living, Convenience, and Satisfaction. TASQ-IV/-SC was administered at treatment Cycles 3 and 6 according to the order of treatment received per arm during the Crossover Period. Participants satisfaction was assessed based on the Question 1 of TASQ-IV/SC which asks participants about their satisfaction with respect to route of administration (very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, dissatisfied, participant did not answer the question). Question 1 - TASQ- IV (How satisfied or dissatisfied were you with the IV infusion?) and TASQ- SC (How satisfied or dissatisfied were you with the SC injection?), Cycles 3 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1 (cycle length=21 days)|Percentage of Participants Who Select Atezolizumab SC for Treatment Continuation Period, At Cycle 6, Day 1, participants were expected to select the route of study treatment administration (SC or IV) they would like to receive during the Treatment Continuation Period (starting at Cycle 7). Percentage of participants who chose SC administration have been reported here. Percentages have been rounded off., Cycle 6 Day 1 (Cycle length=21 days)|Duration of Treatment Preparation According to Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) Response to Perception of Time, Assessed Using Question 1 of Healthcare Professional Questionnaires (HCPQs) - Drug Preparation Area, The HCPQ- Drug Preparation Area Question 1 was completed by the HCPs within the pharmacy/drug preparation area where atezolizumab IV reconstitution or atezolizumab SC was prepared before the actual drug administration took place.
