Treatment of Unresectable Colorectal Metastases by Radiofrequency Ablation Combined or Not With Resection, With or Without Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
The hypothesis is that radiofrequency ablation combined or not with resection may allow a local control (the liver) in patients suffering from unresectable colorectal liver metastases. Patients may have benefit or not from a preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy.
Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: Ablathermy
Complete Hepatic Response Rate at 3 Months, Complete hepatic response (CHR) rate was defined as the absence of new hepatic lesions or contrast enhancement at the ablation and resection sites on CT performed at 2 and 3 months. CHR at 3 months was reported, 3 months
Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the treatment initiation to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death were censored at the date of the last follow-up or last patient contact. The OS was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. 1-year and 2-year OS rate were reported., at 1 and 2 years|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival was measured from the date of intervention to the date of the first of the following events: initial failure, disease progression (hepatic or distant) or death (all causes). Patients who were alive and event-free were consored at the last documented date of follow-up. 1-year and 2-years EFS rates were reported., at 1 and 2 years
