The Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Intratumoral Injection of Chemotherapy for Advanced Solid Tumors
This project intends to investigate the clinical efficacy of intra-tumoural injection of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.)via fine needle aspiration guided by CT or ultrasound in patients with advanced solid cancers to validate the safety and efficacy.

Progress free survival（PFS）, The duration from the beginning of treatment to cancer recurrence or progression, 3 years, year 3|Overall survival（OS）, The duration from the beginning of treatment to patient death, 5 years, year 5
Malignant solid tumours including lung and liver cancers are the most common malignant tumours worldwide and have a very high mortality rate. Currently,the clinical practice mainly relies on systemic administration of chemotherapeutic agents usually by intravenous infusion for patients with solid cancer with multiple metastases,but the overall efficiency is not high.Single or multiple chemotherapeutic agents are infused intratumourally to increase the local drug concentration in the tumour, improve efficacy and reduce drug resistance and systemic adverse effects. This project intends to investigate the clinical efficacy of intra-tumoural injection of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.)via fine needle aspiration guided by CT or ultrasound in patients with advanced solid cancers to validate the safety and efficacy.
