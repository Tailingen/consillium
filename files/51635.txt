Comparative Performance of 64Copper [64Cu]-SAR-bis-PSMA vs 68Ga PSMA-11 PET CT for the Detection of Prostate Cancer Recurrence in the Setting of Biochemical Failure Following Radical Prostatectomy
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT and 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT in men with biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is there a difference in the number of lesions of prostate cancer recurrence detected between the 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT and 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT scans.
* What is the diagnostic accuracy of 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT compared to 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT using a standard of care comparator.
* Evaluate the magnitude of clinical management change when using 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA additional to standard of care imaging (68Ga PSMA-11).

Participants will:

* have 3 visits: 1) standard of care 68Ga PSMA-11 dose and PET/CT scan; 2) 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA dose and PET/CT; 3) 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA PET/CT only
* have standard of care blood test either at Visit 1 or Visit 2
