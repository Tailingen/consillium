Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Surgery vs. Surgery Plus Adjuvant Therapy for ESCC
This phase III randomized clinical trial compared the long-term survival and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery versus surgery with adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Conducted at Sichuan Cancer Hospital, patients were randomly assigned to receive either NCRT (chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgery) or AT (surgery followed by adjuvant therapy based on staging).

The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), with secondary outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS), R0 resection rates, and treatment-related toxicity. A total of 245 patients were randomized, and 224 patients were included in the final analysis.

This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial conducted at Sichuan Cancer Hospital, a high-volume cancer center in China. The primary objective is to compare the long-term survival outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) combined with surgery versus surgery followed by adjuvant therapy (AT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

Patients with histologically confirmed, resectable, locally advanced thoracic ESCC (staged according to the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM classification) were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the NCRT or AT group. The NCRT group received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (40 Gy in 20 fractions) combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by surgery. The AT group underwent surgery first, followed by adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) determined by postoperative pathological staging based on the 2018 NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers.

The study's primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include disease-free survival (DFS), R0 resection rate, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, treatment-related toxicity, and postoperative complications. Safety was assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and the Clavien-Dindo classification for surgical complications.

A total of 245 patients were randomized, with 116 patients in the NCRT group and 108 in the AT group achieving R0 resection and included in the final analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate OS and DFS.

This trial seeks to provide high-quality evidence for optimizing treatment strategies in locally advanced ESCC and to highlight the significance of achieving pathological response as a predictor of improved survival. Future studies with larger sample sizes and multi-center participation are needed to validate these findings.
