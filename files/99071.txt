PET/CT-directed Hyperfractionated Radiation Dose Escalation in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this study is to find the maximum tolerable dose of radiation that can be delivered combined with chemotherapy (carboplatin \& paclitaxel) in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as CTCAE 4 grade 3 acute radiation-related toxicity, 1 year
Time to Local Failure, Local control will be assessed radiographically using endoscopy with biopsy and a positron emission computed tomography-CT scan, 2 years
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for unresectable stage III NSCLC based on the results of phase III randomised trials. The current standard radiation therapy dose has remained 60- Gy at -2 Gy/fraction for nearly four decades (60Gy), with local disease control rates of approximately 50% and a median overall survival of only 18 months.These results are suboptimal and more effective treatment regimens are needed.

We hypothesize that hyperfractionated radiation dose escalation to residual tumor volumes after standard chemoradiotherapy as defined by positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) would improve local control and overall survival while reducing the acute and late normal tissue toxicity.
