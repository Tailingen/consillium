The Investigation of Peginterferon Alfa-2a on the RFS of the Subjects With HCC Who Have Been Treated by Resection
The current study is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center investigation. The aim of current study is to investigate whether the Recurrence-free Survival Rate (RFS）of the hepatitis B related -hepatocellular carcinoma subjects who have been treated by resection can be improved by peginterferon alfa-2a
Chronic Hepatitis b|Hepatic Carcinoma
DRUG: ETV；TDF；ADV|DRUG: Peginterferon Alfa-2a
Recurrence-free Survival Rate (RFS）, Number of subjects without Recurrence in the total subjects, 2 years
Recurrence-free Survival Rate (RFS）, Number of subjects without Recurrence in the total subjects, 1 year|Overall Survival Rate (OS）, Number of subjects with survival in the total subjects, 2 years|Overall Survival Rate (OS）, Number of subjects with survival in the total subjects, 1 year
The subjects who have been treated by resection due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will be randomized into 2 groups: the subjects in group A will be treated by Nucleotide analogues (NAs)( ETV, 0.5mg，qd；tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF)，300mg，qd；ADV，10mg，qd）for 96 weeks; the subjects in group B will be treated by peginterferon alfa-2a （135μg/week）combination with NAs (ETV\\TDF\\ADV)for 96 weeks.
