Pilot Trial of "Chemo-Switch" Regimen to Treat Advanced Melanoma
This research study is testing the "chemo-switch" strategy in melanoma, using biochemotherapy initially to shrink tumors and then switching to daily low-dose chemotherapy (temozolomide) together with sorafenib. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) biochemotherapy followed by temozolomide plus sorafenib have on melanoma.
