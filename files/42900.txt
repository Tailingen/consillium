Overall and Disease Specific Survival in Patients With Confirmed MEN1 With or Without PNET (Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors)
OBJECTIVES:

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of estrogen on the development of the PNET in MEN1 patients.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the overall survival and disease specific survival in patients who have confirmed MEN1 with or without PNET and a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in relation to their hormone status. The secondary objective is to evaluate clinicopathologic features in relation to hormone status.

OTHER: Chart Review|BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire
Time to Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET), Time to PNET calculated starting from the date of menarche time to the PNET diagnostic date or the menopause date (for the patients who get the menopause prior to the PNET diagnosis) or the last follow-up date., 10 years
Overall Survival in Participants Who Have Confirmed MEN1 with or without PNET, Overall survival estimated and plotted using Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan, 1958)(4)., 10 years
Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained MEN1 database. The patient cohort consists of all patients with confirmed MEN1 with or without PNET who are included in the database. The database will be reviewed to obtain patient and disease characteristics, laboratory values, imaging results, hormone parameters (menopausal status, bioidentical hormone use, oral contraception use, gestational status and diagnosis of a prolactinoma) and vital status.

For the prospective portion of this study, investigators want to see the impact of estrogen on the PNET forming and progression, and would like to use two equations to assess the estrogen exposure, so investigators should collect the information of menopause, menarche, breast feed, HRT, OCP use and pregnancy. To this end, investigators will contact female patients in the database who are still living, and obtain verbal informed consent to send an email questionnaire regarding their pregnancy and hormone use history.
