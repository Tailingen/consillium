CART-EGFR-IL13Ra2 in EGFR Amplified Recurrent GBM
This is an open-label phase 1 study to assess the safety and feasibility of autologous T cells co-expressing two CARs targeting the cryptic EGFR epitope 806 and IL13Ra2 (referred to as "CART-EGFR-IL13Ra2 cells") in patients with EGFR-amplified glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype that has recurred following prior radiotherapy. This study will take place in two parts: an initial dose escalation phase followed by a dose exploration phase. In the dose expansion phase, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CART-EGFR-IL13Ra2 cells will be determined using a standard 3+3 design. Once the MTD has been determined, the dose exploration phase will allow for further identification of a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as well as the safety and feasibility of alternative dosing schedules.
