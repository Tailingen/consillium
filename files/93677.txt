Safety and Efficacy of Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T Cells Therapy in the Treatment of r/r MM
It is a single-center, open-labeled, single-arm, non-randomized investigatorinitiated trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells therapy for relapsed and refractory(r/r) multiple myeloma(MM) after three or more lines of treatments.

Incidence of adverse events(AE) after infusion, The frequency, severity, and laboratory findings of all adverse events/serious adverse events are included. Description, time, classification, and outcome of AE events resulted from the investigational medical product, delivery method, or emergency measures will be recorded in the case report form., Up to the subject withdrew or 24 months after CAR-T infusion.|Dose limited toxicity (DLT), Dose limited toxicity(DLT) was defined as the occurrence of any of the following adverse events within 28 days of the infusion of CAR-T cells after optimal supportive treatment, which were discussed with the investigator and determined to be associated or likely to be associated with the infusion., Up to 28 days after infusion.|Overall response rate(ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving strict complete remission(sCR), complete response(CR), very good partial response(VGPR) and partial response(PR)., Day 28 and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 after CAR-T infusion.|Clinical benefit rate, It's defined as the sum of the proportion of subjects who achieved ORR (sCR + CR + VGPR + PR) and minimal response (MR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Day 28 and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 after CAR-T infusion.|Progression-free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival(PFS) refers to the time from cell reinfusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or death from any cause., Up to 24 months after CAR-T infusion.|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the time the patient received an infusion of CAR-T cells until death (from any cause)., Up to 24 months after CAR-T infusion.
Concentration of CAR-T cells, Concentration of CAR-T cells measured by Flow cytometry after CAR-T infusion., Up to 3 months after CAR-T infusion.|Concentration of cytokine, Concentration of CAR-T cells measured by ELISA or other methods after CAR-T infusion., Up to 28 days after CAR-T infusion.
This open label, single-arm, investigator-initiated study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T in subjects with relapsed and refractory(r/r) multiple myeloma(MM) after three or more lines of treatments. A leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture Anti-GPRC5D chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Prior to Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells infusion subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. After infusion, the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy was evaluated by investigators.
