Study of Botanical PHY906 Plus Capecitabine for Advanced Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Capecitabine is a chemotherapeutic that has been approved for use in breast and colorectal cancers. The advantages of capecitabine are that (1) it is an oral drug; and (2) it is less toxic than many other chemotherapeutics. In an off-label hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical study, the response rate with capecitabine was 13%. The botanical drug PHY906--currently manufactured pursuant to GMP standards and regulations--has been used in China for over 1800 years to treat gastrointestinal-related ailments. Recently, preclinical studies demonstrated that PHY906 potentiates the anti-tumor effect of capecitabine. This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PHY906 in enhancing the anti-tumor effects of capecitabine.
