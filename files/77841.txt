Absorption, Metabolism, Excretion, and the Determination of Absolute Bioavailability of Niraparib in Subjects With Cancer
This is an open-label study with 2 parts, plus an extension study following completion of Parts 1 or 2, that is being conducted in approximately 12 subjects (6 subjects in Part 1; 6 subjects in Part 2) with cancer to examine the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and absolute bioavailability of niraparib.
Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib Oral Capsules (Labeled)|DRUG: Niraparib IV (Labeled)|DRUG: Niraparib Oral Capsules (Unlabeled)
Oral bioavailability (F) will be derived using F=AUCoral / AUCiv as a %, Absolute bioavailability of niraparib will be calculated as the ratio of dose normalized oral to IV niraparib exposure, 0 - 22 days
AUC0-last, AUC (Area Under the Curve) from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration, 0 - 22 days|Cmax, Observed Maximum plasma Concentration, 0 - 22 days
Part 1: After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of niraparib (unlabeled active pharmaceutical ingredient) on Day 1. Two hours after the oral dose, subjects will receive a 15-minute IV infusion of niraparib (labeled pharmaceutical ingredient).

Part 2: After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive a single, oral dose of niraparib, labeled active pharmaceutical ingredient.
