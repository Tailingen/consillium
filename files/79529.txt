Intraperitoneal Natural Killer Cells and INCB024360 for Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer
This is a single center phase I trial designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the oral IDO inhibitor INCB024360 when administered as part of a larger regimen of intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of haploidentical donor NK cells and IL-2 after a non-myeloablative cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (Cy/Flu) preparative regimen for the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

Maximum tolerated dose of INCB024360, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB024360 when administered with intraperitoneal haploidentical donor NK cells/IL-2 after a nonmyeloablative cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (Cy/Flu) preparative regimen in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer, 90 days
Initial tumor response, The proportion of patients with initial tumor response (CR or PR), 90 days|Duration of tumor response, Duration of tumor response, 1 year|Progression-free survival, Average time to progression., 5 years|Overall survival, Average length of survival after treatment, 5 years
Haploidentical donor NK cells and the 1st dose of IL-2 are infused intraperitoneally (IP) after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. IP IL-2 continues three times a week for 5 additional doses. INCB024360, at the assigned dose, begins 2 days before the NK cell infusion (on day -2) and continues twice daily for 90 days.

Follow-up for disease response and survival is for 1 year from the NK cell infusion with the possibility of re-treatment for patients who experience at least a clinical benefit for a minimum of 6 months prior to disease progression.

The MTD of INCB024360 will be determined using the continual reassessment method (CRM). The 1st 2 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1 (50 mg bid) of INCB024360. Each new cohort of 2 patients will be sequentially assigned to most appropriate dose by the study statistician based on the updated toxicity profile. Up to 4 dose levels of INCB024360 will be tested (50, 100, 200, and 300 mg bid) with a dose level -1 (25 mg bid) used in the event that 50 mg bid proves to be too toxic. The MTD will be identified when the total sample size of 20 patients is exhausted.
