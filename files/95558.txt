BCMA-targeted LCAR-BCDR Cells in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, dose-finding and dose-expansion study that evaluates the safety, tolerability, PK, and anti-tumor efficacy of LCAR-BCDR cell preparations in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma subjects who received adequate standard therapy.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: LCAR-BCDR cells product
Incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) finding, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design, 30 days after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|CAR positive T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow, CAR positive T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow after LCAR-BCDR infusion, Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow, CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow after LCAR-BCDR infusion, Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve partial response (PR) or better according to international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LCAR-BCDR to the first documented disease progression (according to IMWG criteria) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-AIO to death of the subject, Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)|Incidence of anti-LCAR-BCDR antibody, Venous blood samples will be collected to measure LCAR-BCDR positive cell concentrations and the transgenic level of LCAR-BCDR, at the time points when anti-LCAR-BCDR antibody serum samples are evaluated, Minimum 2 years after LCAR-BCDR infusion (Day 1)
