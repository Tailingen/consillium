Niraparib for the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Unresectable Ovarian Cancer
This is a prospective, interventional, single-arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib monotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, fallopian tube cancer ((FIGO stage III or IV), who had low likelihood of achieving R0 cytoreduction by imaging assessment or laparoscopic evaluation, or cannot tolerate PDS by poor conditions.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib
R0 resection rate, the percentage of patients received R0 resection after Niraparib neoadjuvant treatment., 3-month|Overall Response Rate (ORR) After Neoadjuvant treatment, Overall Response Rate according to RECIST1.1 after Neoadjuvant treatment. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST (v.1.1). Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions., 3-month
Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants achieving Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST1.1 and CA125 according to GCIC guidelines, 3-month|Complete pathologic response rate, Complete pathologic response rate is measured according to Miller-Panye system., 3-month|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., 3-year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival. OS is defined as the time from the study enrollment to death due to any cause., 5-year|Quality of Life (QOL) measures using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT- ovarian cancer), To evaluate quality of life (QOL) for the subjects undergoing this treatment, using validated tools. QOL will be assessed every 3 months during treatment course. \[Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Cancer questionnaire (score range from 0 to 160. Higher scores represent better quality of life., 5 years|Patient report outcome, EQ-VAS, life quality assessment. EQ-VAS, EuroQol-visual analogue scales. Score range from 0 \[worse outcome\] to 10 \[better outcome\])., 3 years|Rate of treatment interruption and termination, The rate of treatment interruption and termination caused by patients' intolerance of treatment side effects and other reasons;, 5 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To further describe safety and assess toxicities encountered with the use of the proposed treatment regimen in patients with stage III, all stage IV ovarian cancer., 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) during niraparib maintain treatment, Overall Response Rate according to RECIST1.1 during niraparib maintain treatment.

ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST (v.1.1). Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions., 1 year
