Immuno-persistence Study of a Recombinant Human Papillomavirus 16/18 Bivalent Vaccine in Preadolescent Girls
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immuno-persistence (type specific IgG antibody) of the tested vaccine administered in girls aged 9-17 years ,comparing to young healthy adults of 18-26 years who received the standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months).
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Cervical Cancer|Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Persistent Infection
PROCEDURE: 3 doses of HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine|PROCEDURE: 2 doses of HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations at Months 18 and 30 (type specific IgG antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type specific IgG antibody level on 18 and 30 months after the dose 1, Month 18 and 30
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations at Months 18 and 30 (type specific neutralizing antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type specific neutralizing antibody level on 18 and 30 months after the dose 1, Month 18 and 30|All the Serious Adverse Events(SAE) occurred during clinical trial time frame would be recorded, between 7 months and 30months after the dose1
This is a follow-up study which is based on the bridging study of a recombinant human papillomavirus 16/18 bivalent vaccine in preadolescent girls(Unique Protocol ID:HPV-PRO-006,Identifiers: NCT02562508) .We will recruit people who have participated in bridging study before and collect their serum samples to test the seroprevalence and geometric mean concentrations of anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 antibody on 18 and 30 months after dose 1.
