Neoadjuvant CAN-2409 in Combination With Chemoradiation or SBRT for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, preliminary efficacy, and immune biologic activity of CAN-2409 + prodrug (valacyclovir or acyclovir) in subjects with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer who are being treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CR) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The Standard of Care (SOC) Control arm will be used as a benchmark for informal comparisons of efficacy, safety, and biomarkers.
Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Aglatimagene besadenovec|RADIATION: Chemoradiation|RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Safety grade by CTCAE version 4.0, Frequency of adverse events., From the time of CAN-2409 administration to 30 days after the last dose of valacyclovir.|Survival Rate, All eligible subjects will be followed for at least 2 additional years from the completion of primary treatment window., 24 months
Overall survival (OS) from time of diagnosis, Time from diagnosis until death from any cause., 60 months|Overall survival (OS) from time of study enrollment, Time from enrollment until death from any cause., 60 months|Progression free survival (PFS) from time of diagnosis, Time from diagnosis until first objective documentation of progression (local or distant) or death from any cause., 60 months|Progression free survival (PFS) from time of study enrollment, Time from study enrollment to documented disease progression or death from any cause., 60 months|Resection rate, Subjects will be considered to have R0 resection if all lesions are removed with negative microscopic surgical margins. Subjects will be considered to have R1 resection if all lesions are removed with any positive microscopic surgical margins., 12 weeks|Disease free survival (DFS) in subjects with R0 resection, Disease-free survival (DFS) will be measured from R0 resection until first objective documentation of recurrence or death from any cause., 60 months|Immunological biomarker characterization in tumor and peripheral blood, Immunophenotyping in the blood and in the tissue., 24 months
Study design is an open-label Phase 2 trial that randomizes subjects with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma to received SOC with (Test arm) or without (Control arm) the addition of CAN-2409 + prodrug (2:1 randomization, Test: Control), beginning after completion of at least 4 months (8 cycles) of a FOLFIRINOX based induction therapy. Confirmation of borderline resectable status will be based on central radiologic review following completion of FOLFIRINOX based induction regimen. Upon enrollment, eligible subjects will receive three courses of CAN-2409 + prodrug, the first course starting prior to CR or SBRT, the second course concurrent with CR or just following completion of SBRT, and the third at time of resection. Up to 2 additional courses are allowed at the time of disease recurrence.
