An Imaging Study of 64Cu-SARTATE Using Positron Emission Tomography in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumours
The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety and potential effectiveness of a drug molecule called 64Cu-SARTATE as a potential new way to detect neuroendocrine cancers.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: 64Cu-SARTATE
Incidence of adverse events related to 64Cu-SARTATE, Occurrence of adverse clinical, biochemical or haematological events assessed for up to 1 week post administration of 64Cu-SARTATE., 1 week post administration|Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest, Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest via whole body PET scan, At 30 minutes following administration|Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest, Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest via whole body PET scan, At 1 hour following administration|Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest, Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest via whole body PET scan, At 4 hours following administration|Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest, Percentage of injected 64Cu-SARTATE dose found in organs of interest via whole body PET scan, At 24 hours following administration|Absorbed organ dose, Absorbed organ doses expressed as micro Sv/MBq of administered 64Cu-SARTATE, and whole body dose expressed as milliSv/200MBq of administered dose as assessed using whole body PET scan (composite outcome), At 30 minutes following administration|Absorbed organ dose, Absorbed organ doses expressed as micro Sv/MBq of administered 64Cu-SARTATE, and whole body dose expressed as milliSv/200MBq of administered dose as assessed using whole body PET scan (composite outcome), At 1 hour following administration|Absorbed organ dose, Absorbed organ doses expressed as micro Sv/MBq of administered 64Cu-SARTATE, and whole body dose expressed as milliSv/200MBq of administered dose as assessed using whole body PET scan (composite outcome), At 4 hours following administration|Absorbed organ dose, Absorbed organ doses expressed as micro Sv/MBq of administered 64Cu-SARTATE, and whole body dose expressed as milliSv/200MBq of administered dose as assessed using whole body PET scan (composite outcome), At 24 hours following administration
Demonstration of known malignancy, Whether 64Cu-SARTATE PET/CT scans demonstrate known sites of 68Ga-DOTATATE avid malignancy with equivalent or greater tumor to background ratios, where background uptake is that found in a non-tumor containing area of interest as decided upon by the nuclear medicine physician at the time of scan assessment., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours following administration|Uptake in non-physiological, non-tumor containing tissues, Whether 64Cu-SARTATE PET/CT scans demonstrate any non-physiological, non-tumor containing tissues with uptake greater than 1.5 x that of the background, where background uptake is defined as in secondary endpoint., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours following administration
