Clomiphene in Males With Prolactinomas and Persistent Hypogonadism
Prolactinomas are usually associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in both sexes. Clomiphene citrate is a well known selective estrogen receptor modulator that increases gonadotropin secretion via hypothalamic-pituitary action. We conducted a prospective, open label clinical trial of CC to evaluate its effects in reverting persistent HH in male patients with prolactinomas under dopaminergic agonist treatment.
