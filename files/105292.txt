Gene Therapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Ad5CMV-p53 gene|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility and tolerability of adenovirus p53 gene therapy and radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with or without prior radiotherapy to the indicator lesion(s).
* Determine p53 and p21 expression and induction of apoptosis and necrosis in patients treated with this regimen.
* Assess any vector incorporation, antitumor response, local control, viral dissemination, and development of adenovirus antibodies in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior radiotherapy to the indicator lesion(s) (yes vs no).

Adenovirus p53 is injected directly into an endobronchial lesion via bronchoscopy or into locoregional tumors via multiple percutaneous punctures under fluoroscopic, ultrasonic, or CT scan guidance on days 1, 3, and 8. Patients undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 2 and continuing for a total of 10 days.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
