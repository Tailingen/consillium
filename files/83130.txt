Clinical Study of Huaier Granules in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer Without Visceral Metastasis
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled, prospective clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huaier Granules in patients with advanced breast cancer without visceral metastasis.
Breast Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: Huaier Granule
Investigator evaluated progression free survival, The time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause. As long as the subject experiences either "disease progression" or "death" first, it reaches the endpoint of the study, start of treatment until 3.5-year follow-up
Overall survival(OS), The time from randomization to death (from any cause), start of treatment until 3.5-year follow-up|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), The percentage of patients with advanced breast cancer who achieved a complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least six months after treatment, start of treatment until 3.5-year follow-up|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose breast cancer has shrunk to a predetermined volume and maintains a minimum time limit, start of treatment until 3.5-year follow-up|Adverse reactions, Harmful reactions of Huaier granules that are unrelated to the purpose of the medication under normal usage and dosage, start of treatment until 3.5-year follow-up
Reduction rate of immune-related cytokines, During the treatment process, the decrease rate of immune related cytokines（Such as IL-1 β， IL-2，IL-4，IL-5，IL-6，IL-8，IL-10，IL-12，IL-17，TNF- α， IFN- α， IFN- γ etc.） compared to the baseline period, The baseline period，12th week±14 days and 168th week±14 days
This study used a blank control design and included at least 384 subjects. The experimental group and control group were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (at least 256 subjects in the experimental group and at least 128 subjects in the control group). Patients in the experimental group were treated with Huaier Granules (10g/dose, 3 times/day), while undergoing routine diagnosis and treatment; The control group received routine diagnosis and treatment, but did not take Huaier granules until the subjects experienced disease progression or intolerance.
