Biomarker 11-dh-TXB2 in Blood and Urine Samples From Patients With Prostate Cancer and Healthy Volunteers
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at a biomarker, 11-dh-TXB2, in blood and urine samples from patients with prostate cancer and healthy volunteers.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: high performance liquid chromatography|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: mass spectrometry
Identification of 11-dh-TXB2 in the blood and urine, 2 to 4 months
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify a potential novel marker of prostate cancer in the blood and urine, 11-dh-TXB2, to be used as a screening tool for prostate cancer as well as in detection of early relapse in patients previously treated for early-stage prostate cancer.

OUTLINE: Blood and urine samples are collected and analyzed for plasma and urinary 11-dh-TXB2 levels by HPLC and tandem-mass spectrometry.
