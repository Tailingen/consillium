Effectiveness of Fractionated Laser Resurfacing to Protect Geriatric Skin From Actinic Neoplasia
This study is following up on previous studies that have demonstrated that geriatric subjects respond different to ultraviolet B (UVB) light than young subjects. The treatment of geriatric skin with dermal rejuvenation therapies (dermabrasion, fractionated laser resurfacing) restores the appropriate UVB response. Ongoing studies have tested the ability of fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) to assess how long this wounding effect lasts-and have found that this appears to be a durable response which lasts for at least two years. The findings that FLR protects geriatric skin at two years is the impetus for this study.

This study is an interventional study to assess if FLR treatment of one forearm of geriatric subjects with multiple actinic keratosis will result in the short-term removal of actinic keratosis, and the long-term decrease in levels of future actinic keratosis and other non-melanoma skin cancers in comparison to the untreated arm.

Study length and visit: The first part of the study is completed in 1 day then there are follow up visits at 90 days and every 6 months for 5 years.
