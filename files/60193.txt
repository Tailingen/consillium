Folfox+Irinotecan+Chemort In Esophageal Cancer
In this research study, is studying how Liposomal Irinotecan in combination with the standard of care interventions FOLFOX, carboplatin paclitaxel, and radiation therapy affect gastroesophageal junction or esophagogastric cancer

This research study involves the following study intervention:

- Liposomal irinotecan
Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma|Esophagogastric Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOX/ nal-IRI|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Proton Radiation Therapy
Pathologic Complete Response Rate, All patients will undergo a full pathological review of their surgical specimen according to the AJCC Staging Classification, 6th. Initial gross evaluation and identification of resection margins will be performed jointly by the surgeon and the pathologist. Pathological complete response will be defined as the absence of any viable tumor cells within the pathologic specimen., 38 Weeks
Number of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Toxicity associated with neoadjuvant FOLFOX/ nal-IRI and chemoradiation will be summarized by category and grade according to the CTCAE version 5.0 Acute and late toxicities will be scored using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version 5.

Toxicities will be noted and recorded in protocol-specific case reports from the time of first dose of protocol therapy until 5 years after the end of protocol therapy, first dose of protocol therapy until 5 years after the end of protocol therapy|Clinical Response, The rate of objective clinical response to induction FOLFOX/ nal-IRI and chemoradiation will be reported as the proportion of eligible patients starting protocol therapy who achieve a complete or partial response as the best overall response, 8 Weeks|Clinical Response, The rate of objective clinical response to induction FOLFOX/ nal-IRI and chemoradiation will be reported as the proportion of eligible patients starting protocol therapy who achieve a complete or partial response as the best overall response, 16 Weeks|Clinical Response, The rate of objective clinical response to induction FOLFOX/ nal-IRI and chemoradiation will be reported as the proportion of eligible patients starting protocol therapy who achieve a complete or partial response as the best overall response, 25 Weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration from the first date of protocol therapy to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause. PFS time will be censored at the date of last follow-up for patients still alive with no documentation of progressive disease. The PFS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals based on the complementary log-log transformation., duration from the first date of protocol therapy to the earliest date of disease progression up 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the first date of protocol therapy to the date of death due to any cause and will be censored at the date of last follow-up for patients still alive. The OS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals based on the complementary log-log transformation, first date of protocol therapy to the date of death due to any cause and will be censored at the date of last follow-up for patients still alive up to 5 years
The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

This research study involves the following standard of care interventions:

* FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium, 5-Fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin)
* Carboplatin
* Paclitaxel
* Radiation therapy

This research study involves the following study intervention:

- Liposomal irinotecan

It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved liposomal irinotecan for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved FOLFOX, carboplatin, and paclitaxel as treatment options for this disease.
