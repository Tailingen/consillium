Allo Transplant Followed by Lenalidomide and Sirolimus Maintenance in High-Risk Multiple Myeloma (MM)
One of the complications that can occur after a stem cell transplant is called graft versus host disease (GVHD). Another complication is that multiple myeloma may come back (relapse). In this study, a drug called lenalidomide will be started 1-2 months after a transplant, or possibly later depending on recovery of your side effects. Lenalidomide and sirolimus have been shown to work together against multiple myeloma. Therefore, lenalidomide will be combined with sirolimus with the hope that this will help prolong the amount of time the disease is in remission. Researchers hope these steps will help prolong the amount of time the multiple myeloma is in remission and will decrease the chance of GvHD.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Phase I: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity, The number of patients who had a DLT during the dose finding/confirming portion (Phase I) of the trial for the safety of the combination of sirolimus, tacrolimus and lenalidomid. Patients will be monitored for 28 days (a cycle) to determine whether a DLT is experienced for the specific dose level., 28 days|Phase II: Percent of Patients Alive and Free of Progression at 12 Months Following Transplant, Percent of patients and the 95% Binomial Confidence interval who were alive and free of progression at 12 months following transplant for the patients in Phase II. Progression will be based on International Myeloma Working Group criteria where patients may meet any one of the following criteria - increase of 25% or more in serum or urine M-protein from baseline, Serum M-protein and/or the absolute increase must be \>=0.5 g/dl, Urine M-protein and/or absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24 hours, development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacyomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacyomas, or development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca++\>11.5 mg/dl) that can be attributed solely to plasma cell proliferative disease., Transplant (Day 0) through 1 year post-transplant
Phase II - Percent of Patients With Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD), Percent of patients and the 95% Binomial Confidence interval who had any stage I-IV acute GvHD based on the modified Keystone Grading Scale for skin, liver and gastrointestinal symptoms for patients in Phase II. Zero means no acute GvHD was reported, and higher stages are worse outcomes (range of 0-4).

For skin: 0=no rash; 1=erthematous macular rash over \<25% body surface; 2=over 25-50% of body surface; 4=bullae, exfoliation ulcerative dermatitis.

For liver (bilirubin (mg/dL)): 0= \<2.0; 1= 2-\<2.9; 3= 3-\<5.9; 4= \>=15 . For gut changes (diarrhea\[ml/day\]): 0=none; 1= \>500-1000; 2= \>1000-1500; 3= \>1500; 4=severe abdominal pain with or without ileus.

Overall grade 0: Skin=0; liver=0; gut changes=0. Overall grade 1: Skin with 1 or 2; liver=0; gut changes=0. Overall grade 2: Skin with 1, 2, or 3; liver=1; gut changes=1. Overall grade 3: Skin with 2 or 3; liver with 2 or 3; gut changes with 2 or 3. Overall grade 4: Patients with grade 4 toxicity in any organ system., Day 0 through 1 year post transplantation|Phase II - Percent of Patients With Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD), Percent of patients and the 95% Binomial Confidence interval who had any chronic GvHD reported based on Filipovich et al. consensus document (BB\&MT 2005) and Akpek et al. chronic GvHD grading system (Blood 2003) for patients in Phase II., Transplant (Day 0) through 1 year post-transplant|Phase II - Percent of Patients With Treatment-related Deaths at 100 Days, Percent of patients and the 95% Binomial Confidence interval who had treatment-related deaths by 100 days for patients in Phase II., 100 days post transplant|Phase II - Percent of Patients With Treatment-related Deaths at 1 Year, Percent of patients and the 95% Binomial Confidence interval who had treatment-related deaths by 1 year for patients in Phase II., Transplant (Day 0) through 1 year post-transplant|Phase II - Time to Neutrophil Engraftment, Time to neutrophil engraftment will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The time to engraftment of neutrophils is defined as the time from day 0 to the date of the first of three consecutive days after transplantation during which the absolute neutrophils count (ANC) is at least 0.5 x109/l. Patients surviving at least 14 days after transplant will be evaluable for this endpoint. Patients who did not have neutrophil engraftment before death will be censored at the date of death. The median and 95% confidence intervals will be provided., Transplant (Day 0) through 1 year post transplant|Phase II - Time to Platelet Engraftment, Time to platelet engraftment will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The time to engraftment of platelets is defined as the time from day 0 to the first of three consecutive Complete Blood Counts (CBCs) obtained on different days after transplantation during which the platelet count is at least 20 x109/l. The CBCs obtained should be at least seven days after the most recent platelet transfusion. Only patients who achieved engraftment of platelets will be included in the analysis. The median and 95% confidence intervals will be provided., Transplant (Day 0) through 1 year post-transplant
