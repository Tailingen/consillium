MITHRIDATE: Ruxolitinib Versus Hydroxycarbamide or Interferon as First Line Therapy in High Risk Polycythemia Vera
The trial will be a phase III, randomised-controlled, multi-centre, international, open-label trial consisting of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy, where best available therapy is a choice of interferon alpha, any formulation permitted (IFN) or hydroxycarbamide (HC), and which will be elected by the Investigator prior to randomisation.

There will be no cross-over either between arm A and B or between therapies on Arm B

HC and IFN will be provided as best available therapy, IFN can include standard of pegylated-interferon at Investigators discretion.
