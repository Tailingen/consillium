Early or Delayed Intervention of Brain Radiotherapy Combined With Almonertinib in EGFR Mutated NSCLC With Brain Metastases
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study of NSCLC patients with intracranial oligo-metastatic EGFR-sensitive mutations treated with EGFR-TKI Almonertinib , according to the implementation time of brain radiotherapy. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, experimental group (early intervention group of brain radiotherapy) : the brain radiotherapy started within 1 month of TKI treatment, the brain radiotherapy here specifically refers to stereotactic radiotherapy; Control group (brain radiotherapy late intervention group) : Brain radiotherapy was given within 3 months after brain progression during TKI treatment. The differences in OS,iPFS, PFS, iORR, safety, neurocognitive function and quality of life between the two groups were compared.
