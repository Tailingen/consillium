A Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of TAC-001 in Patients With Select Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
INCLINE-101 is an open label, multicenter Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TAC-001 administered intravenously.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAC-001
Dose-Escalation Stage: RP2D for TAC-001, To identify the recommended dose phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further evaluation of TAC-001 when administered as monotherapy in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, 2-years|Dose Expansion: Characterization of ORR for TAC-001, To evaluate preliminary efficacy of TAC-001 by estimating the overall response rate (ORR; combined complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, 2 years|Dose Expansion: Characterization of duration of response for TAC-001, To evaluate preliminary efficacy of TAC-001 by estimating the duration of response as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, 2 years|Dose Expansion: Characterization of clinical benefit rate for TAC-001, To evaluate preliminary efficacy of TAC-001 by estimating the clinical benefit rate as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, 2 years
Incidence and Severity of Nonserious Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), To evaluate the safety of TAC-001 monotherapy through the evaluation of incidence and severity of nonserious AEs and SAEs, including immune-related adverse events (irAEs), as graded by investigators according to CTCAE version 5.0, 2 years|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax of TAC-001 monotherapy, 2 years|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), To evaluate the Tmax of TAC-001 monotherapy, 2 years|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), To evaluate the AUC of TAC-001 monotherapy, 2 years|Terminal Half-Life, To evaluate the terminal half-life of TAC-001 monotherapy, 2 years|Clearance of TAC-001, To evaluate the drug clearance of TAC-001 monotherapy, 2 years|Evaluation of immunogenicity of TAC-001, Incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) against TAC-001, 2 years
