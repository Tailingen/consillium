SBRT for Oligometastatic Castration-Refractory Prostate Cancer
Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA) are eligible for this study. 11C-Choline PET/CT will be used to identify metastatic lesions. Patients with \<=3 metastatic lesions will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as definitive treatment. Blood draws will be taken to monitor the development of anti-prostate cancer immunity
