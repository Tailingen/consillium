This trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase II clinical study exploring the starting dose, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Enarodustat Tablets in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) in patients with non-myeloid malignancies, so as to optimize the dose for phase III trials. It is planned to enroll approximately 60 patients.

The trial consists of a screening period (4 weeks), an open-label treatment period (up to 16 weeks), and a follow-up period (2 weeks), totaling approximately 22 weeks. Subjects who withdraw early will be asked to complete an end of treatment visit, and a safety follow-up visit 2 weeks after the end of treatment visit.
