Expression of Molecular Markers in Circulating Tumor Cells of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
As prostate cancer progresses into castration-resistant stage from initial hormone-sensitive status, the biological behavior of tumor cells that dissociated from primary lesions changed. Considered a "liquid biopsy," these circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can show how a patient's cancer responded to treatments. The purpose of this study is to determine whether sequentially analyzing the expression of molecular markers in high volume circulating tumor cells in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients can predict the therapeutic effects and outcomes of these patients.
