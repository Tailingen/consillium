A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Dosimetry, and Preliminary Efficacy of the HER2 Directed Radioligand CAM-H2 in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast, Gastric, and Gastro-Esophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer
This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate safety, tolerability, dosimetry, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of the targeted radionuclide therapeutic CAM-H2 in patients with progressive, advanced/metastatic HER2-positive breast, gastric, and GEJ cancer with disease progression following anti-HER2 standard of care treatment.
Advanced/Metastatic HER2-positive Breast, Gastric, Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer With Disease Progression Following Anti-HER2 Standard of Care Treatment
DRUG: CAM-H2
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) Rate Within the First Cycle, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of CAM-H2 assessed by toxicities occurring within the first cycle, Within the first cycle of CAM-H2, up to 12 weeks|Safety and Tolerability - Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, 18 months
To Assess the Clinical Benefit (CB) of CAM-H2, Evaluate proportion of patients with a Complete Response, Partial Response, and Stable Disease in the dose escalation phase, 18 months|Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) Development, Percentage of patients on CAM-H2 who develop anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), 18 months|Dosimetry Efficacy - Total Absorbed Dose, Thirteen patients in 3 different dose levels were evaluated. The total absorbed dose for the 3 source organs (kidneys, liver, red marrow), 18 months
The study duration for each phase will be up to 18 months. The study is comprised of a Treatment Period, consisting of a maximum of 4 cycles (12 weeks per cycle) of study drug, and a 12-month Long-Term Follow-Up Period.
