Analgesic Efficacy of Erector Spinae Plane Block vs External Oblique Intercostal Plane Block in Subcostal Cancer Surgeries
This study aims to evaluate the impact of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block compared to ultrasound-guided external oblique intercostal plane block regarding management of postoperative acute pain in patients undergoing above Umbilical surgical procedure.

Total amount of morphine consumption, Rescue analgesia will be provided in the form of IV morphine 3 mg boluses if the patient indicates Numeric Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4. The total amount of morphine given in 24 hours will be recorded for the two groups. A maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/24hours of morphine is allowed., 24 hours postoperatively
Total amount of intraoperative fentanyl consumption, Rescue analgesia of fentanyl 1 μg/kg will be given if the mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate rises above 20% of baseline levels., Intraoperatively|Heart rate, Heart rate will be recorded intraoperatively at 5-minute intervals till the end of surgery and the average of each three successive readings., Till the end of surgery|Mean arterial blood pressure, Mean arterial blood pressure will be recorded intraoperatively at 5-minute intervals till the end of surgery and the average of each three successive readings., Till the end of surgery|Time of first rescue analgesia, Time of first rescue analgesia will be recorded from the end of surgery to first dose of morphine administrated. Rescue analgesia will be provided in the form of IV morphine 3 mg boluses if the patient indicates Numeric Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4., 24 hours postoperatively|Complications, Complications related to blocks (local anesthetic systemic toxicity, pneumothorax and arterial puncture) and Morphine related complications (respiratory depression, urine retention or pruritis) will be recorded., 24 hours postoperatively|Patient satisfaction, Degree of patient satisfaction will be assessed on a 5-point Likert scale patient satisfaction (1, extremely dissatisfied; 2, unsatisfied; 3, neutral; 4, satisfied; 5, extremely satisfied)., 24 hours postoperatively
Subcostal incisions in cancer surgeries as in hepatectomy and nephrectomy are a cause of severe pain and can lead to significant respiratory impairment. Regional anesthesia of the trunk and abdominal wall is usually centered on epidural analgesia.

Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is the deposition of local anesthetic (LA) in the interfascial plane at the paraspinal region. It provides effective visceral and somatic analgesia.

The recently described external oblique intercostal plane block (EOIPB) is a simple, effective, and convenient block, particularly in the context of morbid obesity, at which local anesthetic (LA) is deposited in the interfacial plane deep to external oblique muscle at the sixth intercostal space. It provides a blockade of the thoracoabdominal nerves at the level of T6 to T10.
