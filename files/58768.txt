A Study of Subjects With Previously Untreated Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Treated With Platinum Plus Etoposide Chemotherapy With or Without Darbepoetin Alfa
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing or maintaining hemoglobin concentrations with darbepoetin alfa, when administered with platinum-containing chemotherapy in subjects with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), increases survival.
