Trial to Evaluate Laparoscopy-assisted Nerve-preserved Total Mesorectal Excision (LNTME) Versus Open TME for Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine: (1) whether laparoscopy-assisted nerve-preserved total mesorectal excision (LNTME) is as safe as open TME for rectal cancer, and (2) whether LNTME is more effective for protection of pelvic autonomic nerve function from surgical impairing when comparing to open TME.
