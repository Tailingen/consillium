Ripretinib (QINLOCKÂ®) According to Current SmPC
The goal of this prospective, observational study INTEREST is to collect real-world data on ripretinib treatment in a broad patient population in Germany. Ripretinib will be administered according to the current SmPC. Thus, INTEREST will evaluate for the first time ripretinib in GIST patients in a real-world setting in Germany.

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Evaluate quality of live (QoL) using the questionnaire EQ-5D-5L to gain knowledge about how ripretinib treatment affects GIST patients' well-being (change compared to Baseline, Time to Deterioration)
* Assessment of effectiveness in routine treatment (Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival, Best Response, Overall Response Rate, Disease Control Rate
* Assessment of drug safety
* Assessment of parameters of physicians\&#39; treatment decision making
* Description of treatment reality in detail
