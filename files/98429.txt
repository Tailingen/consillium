SIR-Spheres Study to Calculate the Radiation-Absorbed Dose of 99mTc-MAA
The goal of this interventional clinical trial is to evaluate the dose of radiation of Technetium-99m macroaggregated-albumin (99mTc-MAA) after an intra-arterial injection to the whole body and non-liver critical organs in patients who are undergoing evaluation for SIR-Spheres treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Carcinoma|Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Liver Neoplasm
DRUG: 99mTc-Macro Albumin Aggregate
Mean Absorbed Dose (Gy) for the Whole Body, 18-24 hours|Mean Absorbed Dose (Gy) for Critical Non-liver Organs, 18-24 hours|Mean Activity (Bq) for the Whole Body, 18-24 hours|Mean Activity (Bq) for Critical Non-liver Organs, 18-24 hours|Effective Dose (Gy) for the Whole Body, 18-24 hours
The investigation is a prospective, single center, open label, single-arm study. Patients enrolled in the study will have 3 imaging scans taken after 99mTc-MAA injection, the final of which will occur between 18 and 24 hours post-injection.
