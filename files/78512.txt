Physical Activity Post-Cancer for Adolescents and Young Adults
The Physical Activity Post-Cancer for Adolescents and Young Adults (PAPAYA) trial aims to carry out a pilot randomized controlled trial among 10-17 year-old adolescents and young adults, at least 1 year and up to 5 years post-cancer treatment. The trial will evaluate the effects of a 12 week physical activity intervention to improve patient reported outcomes and physical function, in comparison to a delayed-intervention control group.

BEHAVIORAL: Physical Activity
Acceptability-the proportion of adolescents and young adults who agree to participate, The proportion of adolescents and young adults who agree to participate among those deemed eligible by the attending oncologist

Range 0-100%-Higher scores indicate greater acceptability, Baseline|Feasibility-the proportion of adolescents and young adults who complete at least 50% of the physical activity intervention, The percentage of those randomized to the physical activity intervention that complete at least 50% of the physical activity intervention. Participants will be instructed by a project manager during weekly support calls to accumulate a specific amount of physical activity each week.

The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents and young adults at least 1 year, and up to 5 years post-cancer treatment, and randomize them (20 randomized to each condition) to either a 12-week physical activity intervention to improve patient-reported outcomes and physical function, or delayed-intervention control group.

Participants randomized to the intervention group: The physical activity intervention will be structured to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity, to achieve the 60 minute goal, five days per week. The intervention will also include weekly support calls from research staff. The physical activity intervention will be individualized by research staff according to the adolescents and young adults' health status, results from the physical fitness assessment, and most recent week's achieved minutes. The physical activity intervention will be modified during weekly support calls with a study team member, including frequency, intensity, time, and type, to maximize adherence and compliance

Participants randomized to the delayed-intervention control group: They will not receive the physical activity intervention, and they will not receive weekly support calls. Physical activity advice according to the Children's Oncology Group Guidelines for Diet and Physical Activity recommendations will be offered to participants randomized to the delayed-intervention control group following completion of 12-week follow-up.
