HER-2 Expression in Pancreatic Duct Adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive carcinoma that is associated with a poor prognosis. Detection of novel biological markers that are specifically over expressed in pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma and their subsequent targeting by anti cancer therapeutic modalities may improve patient's survival.

correlation of HRE-2 expression with clinical and pathological parameters, levels of HER-2 expression will be correlated with clinical parameters (as patients' ages, sexes, tumor location), and pathological parameters (as tumor grades, stages, neural and vascular invasion)., 6 months
Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly neoplasm that showed current increase in its occurrence. There are many challenges in PDAC; the tumor is frequently associated with perineural invasion and angioinvasion, these lead to early metastasis.Another important challenge is that the tumor is associated with extensive fibrosis that prevents arrival of chemotherapeutic agents. Most modern anti-cancer therapeutic modalities depend on the biologic signature of the tumor. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) is a cell surface protein that is associated with enhanced cellular proliferation. HER-2 has been detected and successfully targeted in many human carcinomas as breast and gastric cancers. we aimed to evaluate the potential cancer-promoting effect of HER-2 in PDAC, in order to detect any possible benefits of its targeting by future therapeutic modalities.
