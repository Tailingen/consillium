Neoadjuvant Ixabepilone/Carboplatin/Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
In this phase II trial the investigators propose to evaluate ixabepilone in combination with carboplatin and trastuzumab as neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients. Patients with early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer will receive six cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with ixabepilone, carboplatin, and trastuzumab every three weeks prior to surgery; after surgery, patients will continue treatment with trastuzumab every three weeks until week 52. Concomitant with the post-operative trastuzumab treatment, patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will receive anti-estrogen treatment. Also, after the completion of chemotherapy, patients may receive radiation treatment at the discretion of their physician.
