Trial of Identifying the Lung Intersegmental Plane by Iron Sucrose Injection Staining
This is a protocol to determine the safety and feasibility of using Iron Sucrose Injection to identify the intersegmental plane,not only on the pleural surface but also the parenchyma of the lung.
Lung Neoplasm|Segmentectomy;Intersegmental Plane
DRUG: Iron Sucrose Injection
Incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events, Incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0, Up to 90 days post-surgery
Surgical margin, Intraoperative measured by the surgeons.From the tumor peripheral to the lung margin.According to the guidelines,the margins should ≥2cm or ≥ the size of the tumor., Day of surgery
duration of air leaks, when there is no air leak in the drainage system, 30 days after the patient was discharged.|Hospital Costs, The expenses incurred in hospital., 30 days after the patient was discharged
This is a protocol to determine the safety and feasibility of using Iron Sucrose Injection to identify the lung intersegmental plane. This is relevant because the detection of small and early lung cancer is becoming increasingly common. segmentectomy may become a more prominent procedure for early-small lung cancer. One of the most difficult aspects of complete segmentectomy is detection of the intersegmental plane while maintaining an adequate surgical margin and remaining lung function. The method used to detect the intersegmental plane remains controversial. It is hoped that this technology can be used to recognize the intersegmental plane on the pleural surface and the pulmonary parenchyma and will save lots of money for patients in developing countries.
