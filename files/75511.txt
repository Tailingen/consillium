Use of Virtual Reality in Pain Management in Pediatric Oncology
DOREVI is a monocentric randomized controlled study that will evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality helmets for pain prevention during invasive care on 78 oncologic pediatric patients. Two groups of children (between 6 and 11 and between 12 and 18 years old) will be randomized to use helmet plus standard care or standard care alone during invasive procedures (central venous catheter puncture, lumbar puncture, or bone marrow aspiration). The pain intensity will be evaluated using a visual analogic scale during three invasive procedures, and results will be compared between the patients with or without virtual reality.

Self pain evaluation, Pain will be assessed by the analogic visual scale (minimal score = 0 (no pain) , maximal score = 10 (maximal pain)), before blood sampling on catheter with implantable chamber
