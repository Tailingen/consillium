Study of ZKAB001 for Maintenance Therapy in Patients With High-grade Osteosarcoma After Adjuvant Chemotherapy
It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with the sample size is 362. The patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who had previously received surgery and completed adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to ZKAB001 group (trial group) or placebo group (control group) according to 1:1. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZKAB001 in maintenance therapy after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma.
High-grade Osteosarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (ZKAB001)|OTHER: placebo
One-year DFS rate, The percentage of patients with no recurrence or metastasis within one year, 1 year
Five-years OS rate, Patients who survive within 5 years after the first dose., 5 years|adverse events, Incidence and severity of adverse events, 5 years|Immunogenecity of ZKAB001, To evaluated the number of subjects presenting detectable anti drug antibodies (ADAs)., 1 year|PD-L1 expression, Correlation between PD-L1 expression level and clinical efficacy, 1 year
The patients will be given ZKAB001 injection in 10mg/kg or placebo once every 3 weeks for a total of 16 cycles or 1 year. The end point is that the patient has been taking the drug for 16 cycles or 1 year, or the patient dies or develops intolerable toxicity or confirmed disease recurrence or distant metastasis or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever comes first.

In this study, after a screening period of no more than 28 days, qualified subjects will be given ZKAB001 or placebo and test visits. Imaging examination will be performed every 12 weeks after the first dose until the local or distant recurrence of the disease, or the initiation of other systematic anti-tumor therapy or death, whichever come first.

The survival follow-up period starts from the last treatment to a maximum of 4 years, or to the death or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of informed consent or the sponsor terminates the study every 3 months.
