[177Lu]-NeoB in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and With [68Ga]-NeoB Lesion Uptake
The purpose of this first-in-human (FIH) study of \[177Lu\]-NeoB is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) as well as the distribution and radiation dosimetry, and anti-tumor activity of \[177Lu\]-NeoB in patients with advanced solid tumors known to overexpress Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) and with \[68Ga\]-NeoB lesion uptake.

Phase I: Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of [177Lu]-NeoB, A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a clinically relevant adverse event or abnormal laboratory value not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation, considered possibly related to \[177Lu\]-NeoB that occurs within 42 days following the first administration of \[177Lu\]-NeoB (cycle 1) and meets any of the criteria listed in Table 6-4 (Criteria for defining dose-limiting toxicities)., Within 42 days following the first administration of [177Lu]-NeoB|Phase I: Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/ Recommended phase two dose (RP2D) of [177Lu]-NeoB, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of \[177Lu\]-NeoB will be identified:

1. MTD is defined as the lowest single dose at which 25% or more of the patients experienced a DLT during the first cycle (6 weeks).
2. RP2D is defined as the single dose level below the MTD.

These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the patient), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the patient)., 15 months|Phase IIa (Cohort E): Adverse Events for [177Lu]-NeoB when co-administered with the NEPi LCZ696 in Cycle 1, The distribution of adverse events for \[177Lu\]-NeoB when co-administered with the neprilysin inhibitor (NEPi) LCZ696 will be done via the analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs) and Deaths due to AEs, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., 25 months|Phase IIa (Cohort E): Dose interruptions and modifications for [177Lu]-NeoB when co-administered with the NEPi LCZ696 in Cycle 1, Within 42 days following the first administration of [177Lu]-NeoB (Cycle 1)|Phase I and Phase IIa: Adverse Events for [177Lu]-NeoB, The distribution of adverse events for \[177Lu\]-NeoB as monotherapy will be done via the analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs) and Deaths due to AEs, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., 25 months|Phase I and Phase IIa: Adverse Events for [68Ga]-NeoB, The distribution of adverse events for \[68Ga\]-NeoB will be done via the analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs) and Deaths due to AEs, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., 25 months|Phase I and Phase IIa: Dose interruptions and modifications, 25 months
This is a Phase I/IIa study which consists of a dose escalation (Phase I) and an expansion part (Phase IIa).

Dose escalation (Phase I):

Phase I study will be conducted in adult patients (age \>= 18 years old) with any of the following selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors: breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastro intestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and glioblastoma (GBM) for whom no standard therapy is available, tolerated or appropriate, and with \[68Ga\]-NeoB lesion uptake as defined in the inclusion criteria.

In Phase I, every effort must be made to include at least one patient of each gender (male/female) in each Dose level to obtain dosimetry data for each gender at all Dose levels tested. However, if it is not feasible, at least 3 patients of each gender must be included in the study before reaching the \[177Lu\]-NeoB Dose level of 100% estimated cumulative dose (ECD) (Dose level 4) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase two dose (RP2D), whichever is lower.

Expansion part (Phase IIa):

The Phase IIa study will be conducted in adult patients (age \>= 18 years old) with:

* For Cohorts A, B, C respectively: Any of the following selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors: breast cancer (human receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) negative including HER 2 low), prostate cancer, and GIST all showing \[68Ga\]-NeoB lesion uptake.
* For Cohort D: Patients affected by any advanced/metastatic solid tumor type known to overexpress GRPR, including recurrent GBM, and with moderate impaired renal function defined as creatinine clearance (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, or measured) â‰¥ 30mL/min and \< 60mL/min.
* For Cohort E (US and UK only): Patients eligible for enrollment in any of the three advanced/metastatic tumor types (as defined for Cohorts A, B, C) who will receive the first cycle of \[177Lu\]-NeoB upon co-administration with LCZ696

  * Enrollment in cohort D will no longer be allowed with implementation of protocol version 07. \*\*
