Efficacy and Safety of Trabectedin (YondelisÂ®) in Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Efficacy and safety of trabectedin in real-life practice, routinely used for the management of advanced sarcoma after failure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide or patients unsuited to receive these drugs in Germany.

Trabectedin is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, after failure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents. Efficacy data are based mainly on liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients.

This is a non-interventional, observational and prospective study to evaluate efficacy and safety of trabectedin in routine practice. Patients are assigned to a therapeutic strategy within current practice, not according to a trial protocol. The prescription of the medicine is separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. Diagnostic or monitoring procedures are only those ordinarily applied to the therapeutic strategy.

There are no dose regimens or medical procedures defined within this study plan. Every medical decision and course of treatment with trabectedin will reflect exclusively the decision of the Investigator in a routine clinical situation according to SmPC. The concept of this non-interventional study and its documentation procedure will not affect in any way the routine treatment situation.
