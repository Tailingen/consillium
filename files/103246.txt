A Study of Galiximab + Rituximab Versus Rituximab + Placebo in Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
This is a Phase III, multicenter, global, clinical study of an investigational drug called galiximab in combination with an approved drug called rituximab in subjects with follicular NHL.

The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical benefit of galiximab when given in combination with rituximab as compared with rituximab alone (given with placebo) in subjects with follicular NHL. Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of galiximab and rituximab will also be evaluated.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's
DRUG: Galiximab in combination with rituximab|DRUG: Rituximab in combination with placebo
To assess efficacy as measured by progression free survival (PFS), and determine whether rituximab plus galiximab compared to rituximab plus placebo may extend PFS., The duration of this study is approx 4 years
Secondary efficacy measures include: event-free survival, time to progression, duration of response, complete response rate, and overall survival., The duration of this study is approx 4 years|Safety measures include: adverse event rates, clinical laboratory results, development of anti-galiximab and human anti-chimeric antibodies., The duration of this study is approx 4 years|Pharmacokinetics, The duration of this study is approx 4 years|Quality of Life using both the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-lym) and the EQ-5D (EuroQoL) instruments, The duration of this study is approx 4 years
