Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Furmonertinib Combined with Bevacizumab As First-Line Treatment for EGFR-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Brain Metastases: a Single-Arm, Open-Label, Prospective Phase II Clinical Study
This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of Befotertinib combined with Bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accompanied by brain or leptomeningeal metastases. It is a single-arm, open-label, prospective Phase II clinical trial aiming to explore the potential benefits of this combination therapy in improving intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients will receive Befotertinib daily and Bevacizumab every three weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The study seeks to address the unmet need for effective treatments in this challenging patient population.

DRUG: The treatment regimen is Furmonertinib combined with Bevacizumab.
12-Month Intracranial Progression-Free Survival Rate Assessed by RECIST 1.1 in Patients with EGFR-Mutant NSCLC and Brain Metastases, The primary outcome measure is the 12-month intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) rate, defined as the proportion of patients who remain free from intracranial disease progression or death due to any cause within 12 months from the initiation of treatment. Disease progression is assessed using the RECIST 1.1 criteria based on imaging studies, including enhanced brain MRI. Progression events are confirmed by independent radiological evaluation to ensure consistency and accuracy., 12 months from the initiation of treatment
