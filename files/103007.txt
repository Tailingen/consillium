Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Percutaneous Ommaya Capsule Injection of Autologous Bi-dimensional Specific T Cells in the Treatment of Glioma and in Combination With Pemetrexed in the Treatment of Brain/Meningeal Metastases
Cerebral metastases are common intracranial tumor, its incidence increased year by year, in recent years, although the whole brain radiation therapy, surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery treatment, targeted drugs, and other comprehensive treatment in patients with symptoms of mitigation and the extension of survival has played a positive role, but due to individual differences, treatment in patients with poor compliance were a lot of factors, Further treatment of brain metastases after conventional treatment requires the assistance and cooperation of clinical multi-disciplines. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous Ommaya capsule injection of autologous bi-dimensional specific T cells in the treatment of glioma and combined with pemetrexed in the treatment of brain/meningeal metastasis. Using translational research techniques and means, to find molecular indicators related to clinical prognosis and outcome, establish the clinical use standard of this holistic treatment technology, and popularize it in multi-centers.
