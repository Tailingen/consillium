A Study of INCB099280 in Combination With Adagrasib in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring a KRASG12C Mutation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of INCB099280 in combination with adagrasib and to establish the MTD or identify RDE(s) for the combination of INCB099280 and adagrasib.
