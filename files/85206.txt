A Phase II Study of IGEV +/- Bortezomib Before Hign Dose Consolidation in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of Bortezomib (Velcade) to IGEV combination (Ifosfamide, Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine) in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma increases the rate of complete remission (PET negativity) at transplantation.
Hodgkin Disease
DRUG: Ifosfamide, Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine|DRUG: Bortezomib + IGEV
PET negativity rate obtained with IGEV or B-IGEV will be compared, PET negativity after 4 courses of induction (IGEV or B-IGEV)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of Bortezomib (Velcade) to IGEV combination (Ifosfamide, Gemcitabine and Vinorelbine) in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma increases the rate of complete remission (PET negativity) at transplantation.
