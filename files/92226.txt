Given that an Expanded Access study does not meet the definition of a controlled clinical investigation, and as such, is not considered an applicable drug clinical trial per NIH, Basic Results for such studies are not required to be reported. Protocol A6181037 has been identified as an Expanded Access trial, and has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov, however Basic Results will not be posted.
