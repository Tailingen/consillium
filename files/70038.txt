Capecitabine and Cisplatin (XP)+Sorafenib in Advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC): Sorafenib+XP
There is strong scientific rationale for exploring the role of sorafenib with capecitabine and cisplatin (XP) in AGC. XP is a new standard of care in AGC and sorafenib is a novel signal transduction inhibitor that prevents tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis through blockade of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGF-R2 and PDGFR-beta.

DRUG: Capecitabine, Cisplatin, Sorafenib
Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Number of Participants who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), 28weeks|Progression-free Survival, 1 year
Response Rate, Tumor response was assessed every two cycles by RECIST(v1.0) using the same imaging techniques and methods used at baseline.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.", or similar definition that is accurate and appropriate, 6 months|Overall Survival, 28 months|Toxicity Profile (According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event Version 3.0), Number of patients who experienced toxicity from study treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Capecitabine and cisplatin plus sorafenib, 28weeks
