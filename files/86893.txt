A Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy Study of RJMty19 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-NHL
This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of RJMty19 in adult subjects with r/r B-NHL.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: RJMty19 (CD19-CAR-DNT cells)
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and determine the recommended dosage of RJMty19 for R/R B-NHL subjects, Up to 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the highest dose for DLT in â‰¤1/6 subjects, Up to 28 days|Incidence of abnormalities, Incidence of abnormalities in AE/SAE/AESI/laboratory tests/electrocardiograms/vital signs., Up to 28 days
Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Cmax), The peak concentration of CD19-CAR-DNT cells amplified in the peripheral blood (Cmax, detected by qPCR and Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (AUC), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC). (AUC, detected by qPCR and Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Tmax), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the peak plasma time (Tmax). Tmax is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax, detected by qPCR and Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (T1/2), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the elimination half-life in hours (T1/2). T1/2 is defined as the time point when the concentration of CD19-CAR-DNT reaches half of maximum in a patient's peripheral blood (T1/2, detected by qPCR and Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Overall Response Rate, The proportion of CR or PR patients as assessed by investigators based on Lugano 2014 Response Assessment, Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The percentage of PR, CR and SD patients in the total patient population, Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, The time from the start of the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment as disease recurrence or progression or death, Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, The length of time that a participant's disease did not progress during or after RJMty19 infusion., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, From the date of entry into the clinical study until death from any cause, Up to 15 years|Overall Response Rate at 3 months, The percentage of PR and CR patients in the total patient population at 3 months, Up to 3 months
The study was based on an accelerated titration and "3+3" design with a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase, and was designed to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic profile, and initial efficacy of RJMty19 in subjects with r/r B-NHL after second-line treatment or above.
