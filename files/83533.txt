To Evaluate Sipuleucel-T Manufactured With Different Concentrations of (PA2024) Antigen
This is a randomized, multicenter, single blind, Phase 2 trial of immunotherapy in men with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer to evaluate sipuleucel-T manufactured with different concentrations of PA2024 antigen
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: sipuleucel-T
Cumulative CD54 Upregulation Ratio Between Each of the Cohorts., An analysis of variance model for the log transformed cumulative CD54 upregulation ratio (CD54 upregulation is the fold increase in the final product (FP) from buoyant density separations (BDS) step 65. BDS65 step refers to sample taken after both BDS77 and BDS65 but before ex vivo culture in the presence of antigen PA2024. FP refers to sample taken after ex vivo culture) that includes the antigen concentration cohort as the independent variable was performed. Subjects who received all 3 infusions were included., Baseline, Months 2, 4 and 6.
This is a randomized, multicenter, single blind, Phase 2 trial of immunotherapy in men with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer to evaluate sipuleucel-T manufactured with 1 of 3 different concentrations of PA2024 antigen The primary purpose of this study is to compare the changes in CD54 upregulation between each of these 3 groups of subjects.
