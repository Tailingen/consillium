RC108 Combine With Furmonertinib With/Without Toripalimab in Patients With EGFR-mutated NSCLC
an open, single-arm, multicenter phase Ib/II study
NSCLC
DRUG: RC108
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), up to 24 months|Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), To observe the durability and safety of RC108 plus Furmonertinib or plus Furmonertinib and Toripalimab in patients with advanced after single and multiple administration, observe the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)and the reversibility of toxicity, 21-days
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Tumor response was assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from first documented OR to first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred earlier, up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response or maintained stable disease during the study, up to 24 months|Overall Survival(OS), OS was defined as the time from the first study treatment to the date of death from any cause, up to 24 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To observe the durability and safety of RC108 plus Furmonertinib or plus Furmonertinib and Toripalimab in patients with advanced after single and multiple administration, observe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)ï¼Œthe relationship between toxicity and dose, 21-days
an open, single-arm, multicenter phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of RC108 in combination with Furmonertinib or in combination with Furmonertinib and Toripalimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR MET-expressing mutated NSCLC who have failed EGFR-TKI, and to develop a reasonable follow-up study for combination dosing regimens
