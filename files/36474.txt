The multicenter randomized phase II study will enroll a target of approximately 150 first-line patients with metastatic CRC.

EGFR expression is not required for study entry, however, the EGFR status will be measured retrospectively.

Patients are randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Arm A: FOLFOX 6 in combination with cetuximab Arm B: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab. Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. The investigators will assess response to treatment at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and thereafter every 12 weeks based on imaging Following permanent treatment cessation (stop of all study treatments) patients will be followed-up for.
