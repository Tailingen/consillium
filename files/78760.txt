Phase 1/2 Study of ZN-d5 for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis
This is a single arm, Open-Label, Phase 1/2 Study of ZN-d5 for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis.
Amyloidosis|AL Amyloidosis
DRUG: ZN-d5
Safety and Tolerability, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0, 18 Months|Dose limiting toxicities, Incidence of Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in DLT evaluable subjects, 18 Months
PK Parameter: Finding max concentration (Cmax) of ZN-d5, Determine the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of ZN-d5 collected in the plasma from subjects at different dose levels., 48 months|PK Parameter: Finding time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of ZN-d5, The duration (in hours) it takes for ZN-d5 to reach the maximum concentration (or Cmax) collected in the plasma from subjects at different dose levels., 48 months|PK Parameter: Finding half-life of ZN-d5, The time takes for half the drug concentration of ZN-d5 to be eliminated (Half-life) from the plasma that was collected from subjects at different dose levels, 48 months|PK Parameter: Finding the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ZN-d5, The total exposure of ZN-d5 over time (AUC) from the plasma collected by the subject at different dose levels., 48 months|Assess the hematologic response to ZN-d5, The number of Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), No Response (NR), Progressive Disease (PD) using the AL Amyloidosis Hematologic Response Criteria., 48 months|Duration and time to hematologic response to ZN-d5, The rate of, duration of, and time to CR, modified Complete Response (mCR), CR+VGPR, and mCR+VGPR, 48 months
To assess potential biomarker of ZN-d5, The number of peripheral B-Cells from blood tests, 48 months
A Single Arm, Open-Label, Phase 1/2 Study of ZN-d5 for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis. The first part of the study is phase 1 dose-escalation and the second part will be phase 2.
