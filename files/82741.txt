Acute Limb Ischemia
Limb Salvage, baseline
Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Peripheral arterial embolism or thrombosis from malignant disease is uncommon and a rare cause of acute limb ischemia. Limb ischemia can be caused by emboli from the tumor itself, from metastatic deposits within large vessels, as well as the tumors of adjacent organs such as the lung, which invade the left or right atrium of the heart and then disseminate to the main arteries of the body. This acute event may be the first indication of malignant disease in the patient.
