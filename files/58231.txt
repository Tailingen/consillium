To Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of Intravesical Instiliations of Disitamab Vedotin in Patients With High-risk Non-muscular Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) That Express HER2
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravesical instiliations of Disitamab Vedotin in patients with high-risk non-muscular invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that express HER2
High-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin for injection
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) (Phase I), Approximately 21 days|Incidence of Adverse event (Phase I), According to the NCI CTCAE V5.0, to evaluate safety including adverse event rate and adverse event grade, Approximately 1 years|Recommended Phase II Dose(RP2D), Assessed based on the Incidence of DLT, Approximately 21 days|Maximum Tolerated Dosage(MTD), Assessed based on the Incidence of DLT, Approximately 21 days
Disease-free survival (DFS) rates, Disease-free survival (DFS) rates was defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the time of the subject's first high-grade Ta, T1 of any grade, CIS lasting greater than or equal to 6 months, new carcinoma in situ (CIS), cystectomy, disease progression, or death from any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Defined as the time from the start of the first assessment of CR to the first assessment of high grade Ta, any grade of T1, new CIS, disease progression, cystectomy, or death from any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Disitamab Vedotin anti-drug antibody (ADA), The number and proportion of anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive subjects were analyzed according to dose group and time point., Up to approximately 2 years|PK of enfortumab vedotin: Maximum concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be recorded from the PK blood samples collected., Approximately 1 years|PK of enfortumab vedotin: Trough concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough will be recorded from the PK blood samples collected., Approximately 1 year
This is a single-arm, multicenter phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravesical instiliations of Disitamab Vedotin in patients with high-risk non-muscular invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that express HER2.
