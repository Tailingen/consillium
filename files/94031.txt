Durvalumab + Intraductal Radiofrequency Ablation (ID-RFA) in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The present clinical trial is a prospective, investigator-initiated, single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase II trial. Patients with unresectable perihilar and/or ductal CCA with indication for bile duct stenting and palliative systemic therapy as determined by the local multidisciplinary team (MDT), who already resolved cholestasis due to RFA + Stent will be enrolled.

We hypothesize that in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the use of a combination radiofrequency ablation followed by systemic treatment with chemotherapy plus durvalumab might further increase the anti-tumor activity.
