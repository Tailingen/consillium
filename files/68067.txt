Study of GT103 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Refractory, Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This open-label, non-randomized Phase II trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of GT103 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory, metastatic NSCLC. The study will consist of a safety lead-in of 10-20 patients. A total of 50 patients will be treated with the combination at the safest dose of GT103 as determined in the safety lead-in. If 10 additional patients are enrolled to the dose level -1 then the maximum of 60 subjects may be accrued to this trial.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Metastatic NSCLC|Recurrent Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: GT103
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with radiographic complete or partial response rate per RECIST v1.1., 3 years|Assess the Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the proportion of patients with DLT observed during the first cycle of treatment. NCI CTCAE v5 will be used to grade adverse events., 6 months
Characterize PK Profile: T1/2 of GT103 in combination with Pembrolizumab, The time for the concentration of GT103 to reach half of the level administered when given in combination with Pembrolizumab (T1/2) will be measured by pharmacokinetic analysis., 6 months|Characterize PK Profile: Tmax of GT103 in combination with Pembrolizumab, The time it takes GT103 to reach maximum concentration when administered with Pembrolizumab will be measured by pharmacokinetic analysis., 6 months|Characterize PK Profile: Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The maximum concentration (Cmax) of GT103 in the serum after administration in combination with Pembrolizumab will be measured by pharmacokinetic analysis., 6 months|Characterize PK Profile: Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs Time Curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) for GT103 will be measured by pharmacokinetic analysis., 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between initiation of treatment and progression by RECIST 1.1 or death., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between initiation of treatment and death from any cause., 4 years
