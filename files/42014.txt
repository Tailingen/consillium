Contact Allergies to Dental Metal as a Possible Risk Factor for Oral Cancer
RATIONALE: Gathering information about allergies to metals may help doctors learn whether having an allergy to metal used in dental work increases the risk of developing oral cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying contact allergies to dental metal as a possible risk factor for oral cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: metal patch tests
Relationship between intraoral metal contact allergy and epithelial carcinogenesis, one year|Prevalence of metal contact allergy comparison to study control data, one year
OBJECTIVES:

* Identify the relationship between intraoral metal contact allergy and epithelial carcinogenesis in patients with newly or previously diagnosed intraoral squamous cell carcinoma.
* Compare the prevalence of metal contact allergy in these patients with control data from other existing study populations.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Participants undergo metal patch testing using 27 metals\* commonly used in dental repairs that are part of the Mayo metal series. Metal patches are applied to the patient's back for 3 days and the back is read on days 3 and 5. Relevant patient data obtained from their medical and dental history, physical exam, laboratory values and treatment are documented.

NOTE: \*Healthy volunteers (control) undergo metal patch testing using 8 metals most commonly positive for contact allergens.
