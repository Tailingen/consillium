Interferon-Beta Gene Transfer (Ad.hIFN-β) as Treatment for Refractory Colorectal Carcinoma With Liver Metastases
This study will be conducted in subjects with refractory colorectal carcinoma with unresectable liver metastases. The purposes of the study are:

* to evaluate the safety and any harmful effects of an intravenous injection of Ad.hIFN-β;
* help determine whether the virus carrying the interferon-beta gene will enter the bloodstream and liver tumor cells and cause the cancer cells to die.
Colorectal Carcinoma|Metastases
DRUG: Ad.hIFN-β (BG00001, IDEC-201)
- Evaluate the safety of a single IV administration of Ad.hIFN-β.
Evaluate the MTD or maximum feasible dose (MFD) of Ad.hIFN-β.|Evaluate IFN-β and Ad.hIFN-β vector serum concentrations.|Evaluate immunogenicity of Ad.hIFN-β by measuring human anti adenovirus and human anti-IFN-β antibody formation.|Explore preliminary clinical activity.
This trial is a clinical research study of Ad.hIFN-β, an investigational, replication-defective, recombinant adenovirus containing the human interferon beta gene, for people that have refractory colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases. Scientists have been exploring a variety of approaches to develop medications to treat patients with refractory colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases; a disease for which current treatment provides only limited relief, so there is a need for new medications.
