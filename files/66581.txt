A Study of Dasatinib in Chronic Phase Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The objective is to evaluate the cytogenetic response to Dasatinib (BMS-354825) administered for 24 weeks in subjects with Imatinib resistant or intolerant chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) once daily (QD) or twice daily. (BID)
Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic
DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: dasatinib
Cytogenetic Response in Imatinib-Intolerant and Imatinib-Resistant Participants at Week 24, Cytogenetic responses (CyR) are based on the percentage of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) metaphases among at least 20 metaphase cells in each bone marrow (BM) sample. The criteria for cytogenetic responses are as follows. Best CyR is defined as the best response obtained at any time during the study. Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) = Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR; 0 Ph+ Cells in Metaphase in BM), and Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR; 1 - 35 Ph+ Cells in Metaphase in BM)., Week 24
Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuations, and Deaths During Treatment, AE=any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Related AE=relationship of certain, probable, possible, or missing. SAE=any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse, is an important medical event., Throughout study period to last observation.
