Phase I Clinical Study of SHR-5495 in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This study is an open, multicenter, dose-increasing/dose-expanding/efficacy expanding Phase I clinical study aimed at evaluating the tolerance, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of SHR-5495 in the treatment of advanced malignant tumor patients, and preliminarily observing its anti-tumor efficacy. The entire study was divided into three stages: dose escalation, dose extension, and efficacy extension.
