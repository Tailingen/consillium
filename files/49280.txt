A Study to Find a Safe and Effective Dose of BI 1701963 Alone and in Combination With BI 3011441 in Patients With Advanced Cancer and a Certain Mutation (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homologue [KRAS])
This is a study in adults with advanced cancer (solid tumours including non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer) in whom previous chemotherapy was not successful. People who have a tumour with a KRAS mutation can participate in the study. A KRAS mutation makes cancer grow faster.

The study tests 2 medicines called BI 1701963 and BI 3011441. BI 1701963 and BI 3011441 prevent activation of KRAS.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 1701963 alone and in combination with BI 3011441 the participants can tolerate. Another purpose is to check whether BI 1701963 in combination with BI 3011441 is able to make tumours shrink.

Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they get tablets of BI 1701963 and capsules of BI 3011441 once daily. The doctors regularly monitor the size of the tumour. Doctors also regularly record any unwanted effects and check participants' health.
