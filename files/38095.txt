Sequential Tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil Potassium Capsule (s-1) and Serplulimab Following Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This Phase II trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of Serplulimab combined with S1 chemotherapy in patients with inoperable, locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after concurrent chemoradiation. The primary endpoint is the one-year progression-free survival rate. Secondary measures include clinical response rates, overall survival, duration of response, and safety profiles. Exploratory goals focus on the potential of biomarkers like PD-L1 and ctDNA to predict treatment outcomes. Treatment involves initial chemoradiation followed by consolidation with Serplulimab and S1, continuing for up to 12 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Locally Advanced Inoperable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Serplulimab|DRUG: Tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium capsule(S1)|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Cisplatin
One-Year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants who are alive and free from disease progression at one year after initiating treatment. Progression is defined according to RECIST v1.1 criteria as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, the appearance of new lesions, or the worsening of non-target disease, 1 year
Incidence of Clinical Complete Response Rate (cCR) at 3 months after treatment initiation, The rate of participants achieving a clinical complete response assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria. A clinical complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels., Assessed at 3 months after treatment initiation|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death from any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival time will be censored at the date of the last known follow-up., From the start of treatment up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for Complete Response or Partial Response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., From the first documented response up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The incidence and severity of adverse events categorized by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., Throughout the study, estimated at 12 months|EORTC-QoL-C30 Score(Quality of Life), Qualitasured using validated instruments such as the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). The quality of life score is calculated based on the rules set by EORTC (range 0-100). A lower score indicates better quality of life on the symptom scales, while a higher score indicates better quality of life scores on the overall health and functional scales., At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months
Grade 3 Pneumonia Incidence [Safety and Tolerability], The study will implement a pre-specified safety threshold where if the incidence of Grade 3 pneumonia, as categorized by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), exceeds 15% of participants, the trial may be modified or halted to assess and mitigate risks to patient safety., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Detailed Description:

This single-arm, Phase II study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of Serplulimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and S1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative) in patients with locally advanced, inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), following concurrent chemoradiation therapy.

Study Treatment Regimen:

Patients enrolled in the study will first undergo concurrent chemoradiation, which includes a total radiation dose of 50.4 Gy delivered in 28 fractions over six weeks. Radiation will be administered using modern techniques such as image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), or helical tomotherapy (TOMO), ensuring precise targeting of the tumor and surrounding lymph nodes. Concurrent chemotherapy consists of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and S1 (60 mg/m2 per day, given in two divided doses from day 1 to day 14, repeated every 28 days).

Following chemoradiation, patients will receive consolidation therapy with Serplulimab administered at a fixed dose of 300 mg every three weeks via intravenous infusion, alongside S1 (60 mg/m2 per day, on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle). This consolidation phase will continue for up to 12 months or 17 cycles, unless there is disease progression, patient withdrawal, onset of unacceptable toxicity, or initiation of new anti-cancer treatment.
