Personalized DC Vaccine for Postoperative Cancer
The study is aimed to the test efficacy and safety of neoantigen-primed dendritic cell (DC) cell vaccine therapy for postoperative locally advanced gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, and to explore the biomarkers related to efficacy and adverse event.
Gastric Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer|Colon Rectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: DC vaccine subcutaneous administration
Disease-free Survival (DFS), Defined as the time from the surgery to the first documented disease recurrence or death (by any cause), whichever occurs first, Up to 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), Defined by the time between the date of randomization and the date of death, Up to 10 years|Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Defined by treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 3 months after the last administration of cells
Postoperative patients with pathological confirmed locally advanced gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer with standard adjuvant treatment are enrolled. This is a prospective exploratory trial. Patients' tumor tissues are subsequent to whole exosome sequencing and possible neoantigens are identified. DC is in vitro primed with synthesized peptides. Both adverse events and responses are recorded.
