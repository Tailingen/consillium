The Role of Concurrent Chemotherapy for Lower Risk Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma(NPC) in the Era of IMRT
The purpose of this study is to verify that simultaneous integrated boost IMRT (SIB-IMRT) alone is non-inferior to SIB-IMRT combined with concurrent chemotherapy for low-risk locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: SIB-IMRT|DRUG: Cisplatin
overall survival, according to the recruitment, a interrim analysis will done in July, 2019, if there is inferior finding of RT alone group, the study will premature terminate, 5 years
Acute and late toxicities, * compare the acute radiation and chemotherapy-related toxicities during treatment course
* compare late toxicities after treatment, 5years|3 year Progression-free survival (PFS), to compare the 3years PFS between the IMRT alone and IMRT with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 5year
* There were several randomized clinical trials confirmed that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is superior to radiotherapy (RT)alone for locally advanced NPC, most of the patients in the trials were treated with conventional radiotherapy technique.
* As the new technique of IMRT used more and more in the clinical practice, the role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) seems blurred, in two of Hongkong phaseIII studies(NPC9901/9902), half of the patients were treated by 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT)/IMRT,the results showed that there were no significant different in terms of overall survival between RT alone and CCRT groups. Furthermore, several large sample size retrospective studies from China, showed that there were no advantage of CCRT over RT alone when treated by SIB-IMRT.
* In an analysis of who will benefit from CCRT,( Lin, et.al, IJROBP,2004; 60:156-164), the author divided the locally advanced NPC patients into two groups, with the high-risk group defined as patients met at least one of following criteria: nodal size \>6 cm, (2) supraclavicular node metastasesN3, T4N2 and multiple neck node metastases with 1 node \>4cm.
* Based on these information, we hypothesize that, for low-risk locally advanced NPC patients, there may no need CCRT under SIB-IMRT treatment.
