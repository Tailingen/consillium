Probiotics for Prevention of Pyrotinib/Neratinib-Induced Diarrhea in Breast Cancer Patients
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of diarrhea in patients with breast cancer receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), specifically Pyrotinib or Neratinib.

Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a probiotics intervention group or a placebo-controlled group. Both groups will be permitted to use loperamide as needed for diarrhea management.

Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients receiving TKIs.

Secondary Objectives: This study will also investigate the effects of probiotics on gut microbiota composition and their potential impact on drug efficacy.

Study Duration: Patient enrollment is expected to take place from January 2025 to June 2027 at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University. Both the intervention and control groups will receive treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week post-intervention observation period, making the total study duration 16 weeks.

Eligibility Criteria: Participants must be diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer and scheduled to receive Pyrotinib or Neratinib. Exclusion criteria include patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders or recent probiotic consumption.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer|Diarrhea Caused by Drug|Neratinib|Pyrotinib
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Probiotics|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo
Occurrence of Grade 3 or Higher Diarrhea, The incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea during the treatment period, assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Up to 12 weeks
Occurrence of Grade 2 or Higher Diarrhea, The incidence of grade 2 or higher diarrhea during the treatment period, assessed using CTCAE., Up to 12 weeks|Duration of Diarrhea, The total duration of diarrhea episodes and the duration of each diarrhea episode experienced by participants during the treatment period., Up to 12 weeks|Hospitalization Rate Due to Diarrhea, The percentage of participants who require hospitalization due to severe diarrhea., Up to 12 weeks|Loperamide Use, The frequency and dosage of loperamide use for diarrhea management., Up to 12 weeks|Change from Baseline in Overall Quality of Life Assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, Changes in quality of life assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The tool evaluates overall health status and functioning, including physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social domains. Higher scores in functional and global health scales indicate better quality of life, while higher scores in symptom scales indicate greater symptom burden., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 (End of Study)|Change from Baseline in Diarrhea-Related Quality of Life Assessed by FACT-D, Changes in diarrhea-related quality of life assessed using the FACT-D subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy system. This tool specifically evaluates the severity and impact of diarrhea symptoms on patients' daily life and well-being. Higher scores indicate fewer symptoms and better diarrhea-related quality of life., Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 (End of Study)|Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) among participants receiving probiotics plus Pyrotinib/Neratinib versus the control group. Adverse events, including nausea, allergic reactions, and other related symptoms, will be recorded throughout the treatment period and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Up to 16 weeks|Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with probiotics or Pyrotinib/Neratinib treatment. Serious adverse events, including severe allergic reactions, life-threatening complications, or hospitalizations, will be recorded and analyzed to assess potential safety concerns., Up to 16 weeks|Treatment Discontinuation Rate Due to Adverse Events, The proportion of participants who discontinue treatment due to adverse events or side effects. The study will evaluate whether the addition of probiotics contributes to safety concerns leading to early termination of therapy., Up to 16 weeks
Gut Microbiota Composition Changes, Analysis of stool samples to assess changes in gut microbiota composition before and after probiotic treatment. This study aims to explore whether probiotics can modulate the gut microbiota and provide a protective effect against diarrhea., Baseline and Week 12|Changes in Gut Microbiota-Associated Metabolites, Measurement of gut microbiota-associated metabolites using metabolomics analysis of stool and blood samples. This includes analyzing changes in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and polyamine metabolites before and after probiotic intervention., Baseline and Week 12|Changes in Peripheral Blood Immune Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, Evaluation of the effects of probiotic treatment on peripheral blood immune cell populations, including T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The study will assess whether gut microbiota-related metabolites influence immune cell activation, differentiation, and function., Baseline and Week 12|Correlation Analysis of Gut Microbiota-Metabolite-Immune Axis, Integrated analysis of gut microbiota composition, blood and gut microbial metabolites, and immune response markers. This study aims to explore potential mechanistic links between gut microbiota, metabolite changes, and immune function., Up to 12 weeks
Breast cancer patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Pyrotinib and Neratinib, often experience severe diarrhea, leading to treatment interruptions, dose reductions, or discontinuation. Emerging evidence highlights the role of gut microbiota in drug metabolism and gastrointestinal toxicity. Probiotics have been proposed as a potential intervention to modulate gut microbiota and mitigate diarrhea; however, their efficacy in preventing TKI-induced diarrhea remains inconclusive.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics in preventing diarrhea in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving TKIs. The study will also explore the impact of probiotics on gut microbiota composition and potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms that may enhance treatment adherence and therapeutic outcomes.

Metagenomic sequencing and targeted metabolomics will be performed on stool and blood samples to investigate gut microbial composition and metabolic changes. Additional analyses will assess the association between gut-derived metabolites and immune cell activation, aiming to elucidate potential interactions among gut microbiota, metabolites, and immune responses.
