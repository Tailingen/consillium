Patient-derived Organoids of Lung Cancer to Test Drug Response
This is a single center, single arm, open and exploratory clinical study, with 50 cases planned for a period of 3 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of a Patient-Derived Organoid (PDO) Model of lung cancer to predict the clinical efficacy of anti-cancer drugs, in order to predict the best chemotherapy regimen for each given patient.
Lung Cancer|Organoid
PROCEDURE: Lung tumor resection
Patient-derived organoid establishment, Successful generation of lung cancer organoids (growth of lung tumoral cells). The rate of successful generation of lung cancer organoids could vary with the age of the patient, the histological and molecular subtype of lung cancer, 3 years|Patient-derived organoid validation, Proportion of patient-derived organoids that are histologically and genetically identical to the source tumour, 5 years
Drug sensitivity, Drug sensitivity of patient-derived tumour organoids (drug screening and chemotherapy resistance test) Secondary drug effects on patient-derived normal lung organoids, 2019 - 2023|Prediction of the response to treatment by the patient-derived organoids, The drug sensitivity was tested on patient-derived tumour organoids, which is compared with clinical response of the chemo- or targeted therapy treatment., 2020 - 2025
The aim of the project is to use a combination of patient-derived organoid models:

* To amplify tumour tissue to obtain enough material for genomic and histological analysis
* to characterize the lung cancer sub-type
* To predict treatment (non)response.

The following points will be addressed:

1. First, the investigators plan to establish and characterize formation of organoids from biopsies of patients with lung cancer: in spheroids, in the 3D cellular model OncoCilAirTM (OncoTheis), and on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Patient-derived organoids from tumoural tissue (PDO) will be characterized and compared to the original tumour.
2. Second, the investigators will test the chemoresponse (chemosensitivity and chemoresistance) of organoids to anti-cancer treatment.
