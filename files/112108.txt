This study is a prospective, single arm, single center open clinical study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of recombinant human endostatin and envafolimab combined with synchronal radiochemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer who cannot undergo surgery in stage III.

Patients with locally advanced stage III squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have not received systematic treatment in the past and cannot be treated surgically, after signing informed consent, qualified subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be screened. They will receive 2 cycles of recombinant human endostatin combined with envafolimab and platinum containing chemotherapy. Radiotherapy will be carried out simultaneously in cycles 1-2, and after 2 cycles, they will receive maintenance treatment with envafolimab until the disease progresses and intolerable toxicity is detected, The treatment period does not exceed 12 months
