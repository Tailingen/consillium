A Study of TAK-659 in Combination With Bendamustine (+/-Rituximab), Gemcitabine, Lenalidomide, or Ibrutinib for the Treatment of Participants With Advanced Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, or ibrutinib.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: TAK-659|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Dose Escalation Phase: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of TAK-659, MTD was defined as the maximum dose that is determined to be safe and tolerable in different cohorts. Each cohort (A, B, C, D and E) received different escalating doses of TAK-659 in combination with other drugs. For each cohort the maximum tolerated dose of TAK-659 in combination with the other drug/s from the selected dose range is reported., Cycle 1 (Cohorts A, B and C - each cycle was of 21 days and Cohorts D and E - each cycle was of 28 days)|Dose Escalation Phase: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TAK-659, The RP2D was the MTD or less. The dose recommended for use in phase 2 studies was analyzed on the basis of the safety, tolerability, and preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy data obtained in phase 1 studies. Each cohort (A, B, C, D and E) received different escalating doses of TAK-659 in combination with other drugs. For each cohort the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAK-659 in combination with the other drug/s from the selected dose range is reported., Cycle 1 (Cohorts A, B and C - each cycle was of 21 days and Cohorts D and E each cycle was of 28 days)
Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for TAK-659, Days 1 and 15: Pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose in Cycle 1 (Cohorts A, B and C - each cycle was of 21 days and Cohorts D and E - each cycle was of 28 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration for TAK-659, Days 1 and 15: Pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose in Cycle 1 (Cohorts A, B and C - each cycle was of 21 days and Cohorts D and E - each cycle was of 28 days)|AUCtau: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve During Dosing Interval, Days 1 and 15: Pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose in Cycle 1 (Cohorts A, B and C - each cycle was of 21 days and Cohorts D and E - each cycle was of 28 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the response-evaluable population who achieved either complete response (CR), or partial response (PR). CR was defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease, and PR was defined as regression of measurable disease and no new sites., Up to 123 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response to the date of first documented PD. PD was defined as any new lesion or increase by \> 50% of previously involved sites from nadir., Up to 123 weeks|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of first drug administration to the date of first documented PD. PD was defined as any new lesion or increase by \>50% of previously involved sites from nadir., Up to 123 weeks|Safety Expansion Phase: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD was defined as any new lesion or increase by \>50% of previously involved sites from nadir., Up to study completion (Up to 123 weeks)
The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 96 participants.

Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 combination cohorts:

* Dose Escalation Phase Cohort A: TAK-659 + Bendamustine
* Dose Escalation Phase Cohort B: TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab
* Dose Escalation Phase Cohort C: TAK-659 + Gemcitabine
* Dose Escalation Phase Cohort D: TAK-659 + Lenalidomide
* Dose Escalation Phase Cohort E: TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This study comprises 2 phases: a dose escalation phase and a safety expansion phase. Participants in all 5 cohorts (Cohorts A-E) will participate in the dose escalation phase of the study. Approximately 12 additional participants with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) will be added to Cohort B, in the safety expansion phase.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
