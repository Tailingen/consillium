GE Healthcare VolumeRAD Lung Nodule Detection Study
To perform a multiple reader, multiple case (MRMC) observer study assessing the detection performance of VolumeRAD tomosynthesis of the chest in detecting lung nodules.
Pulmonary Nodule, Solitary|Multiple Pulmonary Nodules
DEVICE: Chest tomosynthesis and X-ray
Multi-reader, multi-case Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) methodology., The primary objective of this study is to determine if the use of VolumeRAD tomosynthesis increases the accuracy of the detection of lung nodules between 3mm and 20mm in diameter when compared to conventional PA and lateral chest radiography alone., Post accrual of 210 participants
Actionability classification accuracy of all modalities, Multipe reader, multiple case reader study
Digital tomosynthesis is a form of limited angle tomography that creates a series of section images using a conventional x-ray tube and generator, a digital detector, and appropriate reconstruction software. It creates section images from a series of projection images acquired as the x-ray tube moves along a prescribed path. Because tomosynthesis can minimize the visual presence of overlying anatomy - the ribs, for example - it has the potential to improve the detection of lesions such as pulmonary nodules when compared with conventional chest radiography.

The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the use of VolumeRAD tomosynthesis, in addition to CxR, increases physician accuracy in the detection of lung nodules between 3mm and 20mm in diameter when compared to conventional posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral (LAT) chest radiography (CxR). This aim will be addressed by measuring free-response performance of experienced (with VolumeRAD), blinded expert readers' detection performance. Specifically, we will compare detection performance, as measured by the area under the alternative free response receiver operating characteristic (AFROC) curve, among readers viewing PA and LAT chest X-rays versus VolumeRAD tomosynthesis. The nodule will be the unit of analysis.
