Rationale: Fitter patients have better surgical outcomes. Poor physical fitness measured objectively using cardiopulmonary exercise testing has been associated with increased LOS, increased morbidity and mortality in many patient cohorts undergoing major cancer surgery. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have detrimental effects on physical fitness, which may in turn have a detrimental effect on the patients' ability to withstand surgery. Research suggests psychological factors including depression and self-efficacy (confidence to manage cancer-related problems) prior to surgery predict recovery trajectories in health-related quality of life up to 2 years after major surgery for colorectal cancer.

The aim is to investigate whether SRETP (Prehabilitation) ± psychological support prior to and during cancer treatment before major elective surgery reduces LOS, increases survival and improves their ability to self manage. Additionally, we aim to see if this intervention can bring about long-term behavioural change in relation to physical activity.

Trial Design: Phase III: A pragmatic factorial design randomised controlled to assess the effectiveness of a prehabilitation programme delivered prior to cancer treatments and/or major cancer surgery in patients undergoing elective intra-cavity major cancer surgery in Wessex.

Sample size: 1560

Intervention:

1. An in-hospital transition to a community based Structured Responsive Exercise-Training Programme (SRETP) ± psychological support (delivered in community/ council gyms or Cancer Support Centers). The intervention/s will be delivered before surgery. Patients receiving neoadjuvant cancer treatments prior to surgery will receive the intervention during and after these treatments.
2. Control: Standard care with extra monitoring
