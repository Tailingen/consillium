Segmentectomy for Ground Glass-dominant Invasive Lung Cancer (ECTOP-1012)
This is a clinical trial from Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Project (ECTOP), numbered as ECTOP-1012. The goal of this clinical trial is to confirm the theraputic effect of segmentectomy for ground glass-dominant invasive lung cancer with size of 2-3cm. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The 5-year disease-free survival of patients having ground glass-dominant invasive lung cancer with size of 2-3cm;
* The post-operative lung function tests after receiving segmentectomy. Participants will receive segmentectomy as the surgical procedure.

PROCEDURE: Segmentectomy
5-year disease-free survival, The event is defined as the tumor recurrence or the death due to any causes., 5 years
Lung function test, FEV1/FVC, Half year and one year after surgical resection|5-year overall survival, The event is defined as death due to any causes or last follow-up., 5 years|The site of tumor recurrence and metastasis, Outpatient follow-up was conducted regularly after surgery, and the recurrence or metastasis site and time will be recorded., From date of surgery to the last follow-up or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Segmentectomy completion rate, Proportion of patients who complete planned segmentectomy., From the beginning of the surgery to the end of the surgery.|Radical segmentectomy (R0 resection) completion rate, According to the postoperative pathology report of the patients, the proportion of patients with no residual tumor after radical segmentectomy accounted for all patients who underwent segmentectomy., From surgery to the release of the final pathology report, an average of two weeks.|Surgery-related complications, such as air leak, atrial fibrillation, intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage, postoperative infection, bronchopleural fistula, etc, From surgery to patient discharge or 30 days after surgery.
