Comparison of cVATS Segmentectomy Versus Lobectomy for Lung Adenocarcinoma in Situ and With Microinvasion
This is a Prospective, open-label, parallel, multi-center, Phase III randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy versus Lobectomy in treating patients with Lung adenocarcinoma in situ or with microinvasion.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage I|Lung Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: patients undergo cVATS segmentectomy|PROCEDURE: Patients undergo cVATS lobectomy
Relapse-free survival, Compare the relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with lung adenocarcinoma in situ or microinvasion undergoing cVATS segmentectomy vs lobectomy., From date of randomization until the date of first documented relapse or metastasis, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
5-year survival rate, Compare the 5-year survival rate of patients undergoing cVATS segmentectomy vs lobectomy, participants are followed until death or up to 5 years|postoperative complication, Compare the postoperative complication rate of patients undergoing cVATS segmentectomy vs lobectomy, 0 to 3 months postoperatively|pulmonary function, to evaluate the pulmonary function as measured by expiratory flow rate of the two groups 6 months postoperatively, 6 months after surgery|Quality of Life, To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of these patients, as measured by questionnaire of FACT-L (4th edition) and LCSS (Lung Cancer Symptom Scale), 0 to 6 months postoperative
Lobectomy has long been considered the standard procedure for early-stage lung cancer, and minimally invasive techniques have been demonstrated to be associated with superior outcomes compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy. the us of segmentectomy is under investigation for selected patients with small tumors, and the use of minimally invasive strategies is applicable as well.

This nationwide, multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study of cVATS (complete Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) segmentectomy versus Lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Lung adenocarcinoma in situ or with microinvasion, is aiming to evaluate the relapse free survival and 5 year overall survival (OS) rate of two types of surgery. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo cVATS lobectomy.
* Arm II: Patients undergo cVATS segmentectomy.

Patients will be followed up every 3 months within the first year, and annually for 5 years postoperatively.
