Sleep Apnea and Lung Cancer
cases of locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (diagnosed by PET/CT scan and histopathological confirmation) will be screened for sleep disorders by Epworth sleepiness scale then confirmed by full night polysomnographic study. Blood sample to detect some genetic determinants will be withdrawn
