A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of BCMA-GPRC5D CAR-T in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Who Received Three or More Lines of Therapy
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bispecific BCMA-GPRC5D Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received three or more lines of therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + BCMA-GPRC5D CAR-T Cells
Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome are graded by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria. Other therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), within 2 years after infusion

B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has yielded satisfactory clinical outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). However, BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells cannot achieve a favorable response in patients with dim or negative BCMA expression on the tumor surface at baseline or relapse. G protein-coupled receptor, class C, group 5, member D (GPRC5D) is highly distributed on MM cells and proves to be a promising target for MM. In normal tissues, it is restrictedly expressed in hair follicle, rendering it a safe target for CAR-T cell therapy as well. To construct a bispecific BCMA-GPRC5D CAR structure would help mitigate the antigen escape and elevates the clinical efficacy.

This is an investigational study. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-GPRC5D CAR-T cells in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM disease.
