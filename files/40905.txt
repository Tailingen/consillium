SP Thoracic IDE Study
To confirm the safety and performance of the da Vinci SP Surgical System, Instruments and Accessories in pulmonary lobectomy, and in thymectomy procedures.
Primary Lung Cancer|Benign Lung Disease|Thymoma|Myasthenia Gravis
DEVICE: Robotic-Assisted Surgery
Rate of Conversion, Performance defined as the ability to complete the planned da Vinci SP-assisted pulmonary lobectomy and thymectomy procedures without conversion to an alternate approach, Intra-operative period|Adverse Event Rate, Safety defined as the incidence of all intra-operative and post-operative adverse events that occur through the 30-day follow-up period., Intra-operative through the 30 days follow-up period
Primary performance:

The primary endpoint will be assessed as the ability to complete the planned da Vinci SP-assisted thoracic procedure without conversion to an alternate approach. Conversion to an alternate approach comprises undocking of the da Vinci SP to complete the planned procedures using other methods, such as open, VATS, or multiport robotic (da Vinci SI or X/Xi)

Primary Safety:

The primary safety endpoint will be assessed as the incidence of all intra-operative and post-operative adverse events that occur through the 30-day follow-up period.
