Aer-O-Scope Validation of Cecal Intubation, The number of subjects for which cecal intubation will be achieved using the Aer-O-Scope Disposable Colonoscope, 30 minutes
This will be a prospective single-center non-blinded clinical investigation. Each subject will undergo a colonoscopy to the cecum with the Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System. All pathologies found will be removed. No control group is necessary as the main objective is to reach the cecum. Either the cecum is intubated or it is not. This is true for all colonoscopy procedures.

Up to the first ten (10) cases for each physician will be system operation training cases.

The primary endpoint of cecal intubation was chosen as this measure is the first quality objective when evaluating colonoscopy quality indicators.
