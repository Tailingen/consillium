NBI Versus Indigo Carmine During Colonoscopy in Lynch Syndrome
This study compares two colonoscopy techniques (with Narrow Band Imaging versus with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy) in patients having Lynch Syndrome
Lynch Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy
Number of adenomas and / or adenocarcinoma detected during each procedure (NBI vs Indigo carmine), The adenoma detection rate (number of adenoma and/or adenocarcinoma) of NBI and the additional adenoma detection rate of indigo carmine., procedure time
All neoplastic lesions detected during colonoscopy, Collect the number, size, location, endoscopic (Paris Classification) and anatomo-pathologic aspect (adenoma, hyperplastic polyp, adenocarcinoma) of all detected lesions with their respective prevalence., procedure time|Cost of each procedure (NBI vs Indigo carmine), Evaluate the cost of each procedure including therapy., Procedure time|Duration of each procedure (NBI vs Indigo carmine), Evaluate the duration of each procedure (with and without endoscopic therapy)., Procedure time|Number of subject with adverse events as mesure of safety., Followed a month post colonoscopy to evaluate the occurrence of undesirable events, One month after colonoscopy
Chromoendoscopy using indigo carmine dye is recommended every 1 to 2 years in patients having Lynch Syndrome (LS). However, it is a time-consuming procedure, requiring a prior learning and has an additional cost, the reason why it is not yet systematically practiced in all endoscopy centers. The "Narrow Band Imaging" (NBI) is a recent virtual chromoendoscopy technique using optical filters at the light source of the endoscope to highlight the vascular structures of the mucosa by pressing a button. NBI is currently used to better characterize dysplasia lesions in the esophageal, gastric, and colon mucosa. A new generation (3rd generation) of NBI is currently available on some endoscopes, it can deliver more brightness and contrast, and could allow for better detection of flat lesions. Until today, no study has directly compared colonic chromoendoscopy with Indigo carmine to virtual chromoendoscopy with NBI (3rd generation) in LS patients. The hypothesis that this research aims to verify is that the new generation NBI system might do at least as well as indigo carmine in colonic adenoma detection in LS. This study aims to compare colonoscopy with virtual chromoendoscopy using 3rd generation NBI system to chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine in LS patients, in a back-to-back, prospective non inferiority design, in which all patients will have both techniques in the following order: NBI first followed by Indigo carmine.
