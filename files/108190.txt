Safety and Immunogenicity of 9-valent Human Papillomavirus (9vHPV) Vaccine Coadministered With Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA)-1273 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) Vaccine (V503-076)
The purpose of this study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine, where the first dose is administered concomitantly with a first dose of a 2-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus nonconcomitant administration of 9vHPV and mRNA-1273 vaccines in boys and girls 9 to 11 years of age.

Geometric Mean Titers of Anti-Human Papillomavirus Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 will be measured with a competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA). Titers are reported in milli Merck Units/mL., 4 weeks post vaccination 2|Geometric Mean Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Specific Binding Antibodies, Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein measured by electrochemiluminescence (ECL), 4 weeks post vaccination 2|Percentage of Participants with at Least 1 Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Solicited AEs are predefined local (at the injection site) for which the participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant in their vaccine report card (VRC)., Up to Day 7 post vaccination|Percentage of Participants with at Least 1 Solicited Systemic AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Solicited AEs are predefined systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant in their VRC., Up to Day 7 post vaccination|Percentage of Participants with at Least 1 Serious Adverse Event, A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one that results in death, is life threatening, or requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event that may require medical intervention., Up to ~Month 9|Percentage of Participants with at Least 1 Vaccine-Related SAE, An SAE is defined as one that results in death, is life threatening, or requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event that may require medical intervention. An SAE that is judged by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine is a vaccine-related SAE., Up to ~Month 9
Percentage of Participants Who Seroconvert to Each of the 9vHPV Vaccine Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 Following Administration of a 2-Dose Regimen of 9vHPV Vaccine, Serum antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 will be measured with a competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA). Percentage of participants who seroconverted will be assessed., 4 weeks post vaccination 2|Percentage of Participants Who Experience Seroresponse Following Administration of a 2-Dose Regimen of mRNA-1273 Vaccine, Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein measured by ECL assay. Percentage of participants who experience seroresponse will be assessed., 4 weeks post vaccination 2
