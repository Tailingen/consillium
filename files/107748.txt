The Feasibility and Advantages of Painless Indwelling Catheter in Uniportal VATS Lobectomy of Lung Cancer
This study is a prospective cohort study.The main study content is the feasibility and advantages of painless indwelling catheter in perioperative period of uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in lobectomy of lung cancer,divided into exposed and non-exposed groups.The exposed group was painless indwelled urethral catheter, the non-exposed group was indwelled urethral catheter routinely.
Urethral Catheter; Complications
PROCEDURE: painless indwelling catheter|PROCEDURE: indwelling catheter
Urine retention rate, Urine retention rate, 10 days
Urinary tract infection, The two groups of patients were each examined for middle urine after extubation. Refer to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the 2006 Hospital Infection Diagnostic Criteria (Trial): If the urinary leukocyte male ≥ 5 / high power field, female ≥ 10 / high power field, accompanied or not accompanied by urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, etc. Symptoms of urinary tract irritation; or pain in the lower abdomen, pain in the kidney area, with or without fever., 10 days|Postoperative bedtime, The time from the patient's postoperative pushback to the first bedtime, 2 days|Postoperative hospital stay, Postoperative hospital stay, 15 days|The total cost of hospitalization, The total cost of hospitalization, 15 days|Postoperative pain level, Using visual analogue scale/score (VAS), the degree of discomfort (pain and urinary sensation) is represented by 11 numbers from 0 to 10, with 0 being painless and no urine, and 10 being the most painful. (or) The sense of urinary sensation is strong, so that the patient can choose the number according to the feeling of self, indicating the degree. 0 degree: 0 points, no discomfort; I degree (mild): 1 to 3 points, with slight pain and/or urinary sensation, can tolerate; II degree (moderate): 4 to 7 points, patient pain And/or urinary sensation and affect sleep, can tolerate; III degree (severe): 8 to 10 points, the patient has progressively strong pain and/or urinary sensation, pain is unbearable, affecting appetite, affecting sleep., 3 days
This study is a prospective cohort study.The main study content is the feasibility and advantages of painless indwelling catheter in perioperative period of uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in radical resection of lung cancer,divided into exposed and non-exposed groups,divided into exposed and non-exposed groups.Communicating with the surgeon and patients who meet the inclusion criteria, decide whether to enter the exposed or non-exposed group.The exposed group was painless indwelled urethral catheter, the non-exposed group was indwelled urethral catheter routinely.By collecting personal information of two groups of patients and the corresponding observation indicators to analyze whether the painless indwelling urethral catheters in lobectomy of lung cancer is more beneficial than the indwelled urethral catheter routinely in lobectomy of lung cancer, and it is safe and feasible.
