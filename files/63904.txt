Clinical Trial of Electroacupuncture Stimulation on Prevention and Treatment of Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity
The clinical trail of electroacupuncture combined with oxaliplatin regimen on gastrointestinal carcinoma.This trail is randomized controled.Patients are diagnosed gastrointestinal cancer based on pathology or cell biology.They are randomized into 2 groups:both groups receive Oxaliplatin regimen.The treatment group receives electroacupuncture in addition to the chemotherapy.The control group only receive the same chemotherapy with the treatment group.Both group have the same adjuvant therapy.
Neurotoxicity|Gastrointestinal Neoplasms
OTHER: electro-acupuncture
Levi sensory nerve toxicity classification standard, Scoring scale, every cycle of chemotherapy (measure 3 cycles, each cycle is 21 days), up to 3 months]
The quality of life questionnaire(QLQ)-C30, Scoring scale, every cycle of chemotherapy (measure 3 cycles, each cycle is 21 days), up to 3 months]
