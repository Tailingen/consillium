AI Derived Biomarker to Select Neoadjuvant Treatment for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
To collect samples and information from patients who will be undergoing standard of care neoadjuvant treatment with either FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel.

The information collected will be used to determine if there are any "biomarkers" in your blood or tumor tissue that, when compared to your response to the neoadjuvant treatment, could be used to choose the best treatment option for future patients with similar biomarkers.

Retrospective prediction of pCR in resectable patients, Pathologic response is based on the American College of Pathology Criteria. The AI classified treatment is based on the best representative slide analyzed by the Valar Labs AI algorithm for V-FFX (is Folfirinox recommended) and V-GNP (is GEM/NAB-Paclitaxel recommended, Up to 2 years|Retrospective prediction of pCR in borderline resectable patients, Pathologic response is based on the American College of Pathology Criteria.
