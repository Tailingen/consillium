Transdiagnostic Intervention to Reduce Internalized Health-Related Stigma
Stigma due to health conditions increases disease burden and adversely impacts health. The internalization of health-related stigma is associated with impaired mental health and quality of life. The current project will test the effects of a novel, transdiagnostic, group counseling intervention, and peer support, to determine the optimal method for helping patients cope with health-related stigma, reducing its internalization, and enhancing patient quality of life.

Participants also rate (1-7) how likely they would be to recommend the program to others and the extent to which they learned new things, changed their attitudes about themselves, and the program helped with managing their health conditions. Participants also rate how much they learned and used specific skills from the program; these item responses are averaged on a 1-7 scale for learned skills and on a 1-5 scale for used skills. Higher scores indicate greater treatment acceptability., Week 12|Treatment Acceptability ratings at Week 26, To assess treatment acceptability, participants in the two active treatment groups (not the waitlist control group) rate from 1-7 how acceptable and helpful the program was, how much they liked the program, and how satisfied they were; scores for these 4 items are averaged.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test in a sample of 195 patients with high levels of internalized health-related stigma the effects of a novel transdiagnostic intervention designed to help patients cope with this stigma and to reduce its internalization. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: (1) a group-based counseling intervention designed to target internalized health-related stigma, delivered virtually (i.e., via telehealth); (2) a general peer support group conducted via telehealth without a targeted stigma intervention; or (3) a waitlist control group. The counseling and peer support conditions will provide 12 weekly group sessions, followed by 2 every other week sessions and 2 monthly sessions (16 sessions total over the course of 26 weeks, or 6 months). Participants across all conditions will complete outcome assessment visits at baseline/randomization, week 12, and week 26. The waitlist control group will receive 12 weeks of the group counseling intervention (condition #1) after completing the week 26 assessment. The primary trial outcome will be the change in internalized stigma from baseline to week 12 (following the most intensive part of the intervention). Change in internalized stigma from baseline to week 26 will be a secondary outcome to determine lasting effects of the intervention in a "maintenance" period with less frequent intervention. Other secondary outcomes will include depression, anxiety, stress, coping, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
