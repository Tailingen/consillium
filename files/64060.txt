A Study of LP-168 in Participants with Relapse or Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study of oral LP-168 in patients with CLL/SLL and NHL who have failed or are intolerant to standard of care.
B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: LP-168 tablet
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Phase 1a, Up to 24 Months|Recommended dose for Phase2 (RP2D), Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 24 Months|To evaluate the safety of LP-168 by assessing incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events as determined by CTCAE v5.0, Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 24 Months
Overall Response Rate, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of LP-168 based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator and IRC., Up to 24 Months|Progression Free Survival, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of LP-168 based on Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Investigator and IRC, Up to 24 Months|Duration of Response, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of LP-168 based on Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the Investigator and IRC., Up to 24 Months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) As Assessed By Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of LP-168, Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 48 hours post dose|PK As Assessed By Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To The Time Of The Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t) Of LP-168, Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 48 hours post dose|PK As Assessed By Time To Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) Of LP-168, Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 48 hours post dose|PK As Assessed By Terminal Half-life (t1/2) Of LP-168, Phase Ia/Ib, Up to 48 hours post dose
This study includes 2 parts: phase 1a (LP-168 monotherapy dose escalation) and phase 1b (LP-168 dose expansion). In phase 1a, patients will be enrolled using an 3+3 design. The starting dose of LP-168 in oral tablet form is 100 mg/day (e.g., 100 mg once daily \[QD\]). Once the MTD and/or RP2D is identified in phase 1a dose escalation, enrollment will continue to phase 1b dose expansion. Cycle length will be 28 days.
