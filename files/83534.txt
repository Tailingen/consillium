A Open-Label, Multiple Ascending Dose Study of DS-3078a, an Oral TORC1/2 Kinase Inhibitor, in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
DS-3078a will be evaluated as a single agent in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas refractory to standard treatment or for which no standard treatment is available.

This is a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-3078a to assess safety and tolerability, identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and tentative recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas. The study will include 2 parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.
