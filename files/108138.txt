Capivasertib+Paclitaxel as First Line Treatment for Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic TNBC
Phase III Study of Capivasertib + Paclitaxel versus Placebo + Paclitaxel as First line Treatment for Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Capivasertib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), The time from date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause up to approximately 42 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival by investigator assessment (in accordance with RECIST 1.1), The time from date of randomization to the date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier, up to approximately 42 months|Investigator assessment of PFS2, PFS2 - time from randomisation to second progression or death, Time from randomization to second progression or death due to any cause up to approximately 42 months|Response Rate (ORR), Response Rate (ORR) - percentage of patients with at least one investigator-assessed visit response of complete or partial response (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1), Up to approximately 42 months|Safety and tolerability of drugs by assessment of AEs/SAEs, Graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI CTCAE), Up to approximately 42 months|Minimum plasma concentration(Cmin), plasma concentration1-2 hours post-dose (C1-2h) and 4 hours post-dose (C4h) during months 1 and 2, Plasma PK parameters derived from a population model as data permits, During months 1 and 2|EORTC QLQ BR23(European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire breast cancer specific module), The self-administered instrument includes 23-items and yields 5 multi-item scores (body image, sexual functioning, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, and systemic therapy side effects). Items are scored on a 4-point verbal rating scale: "Not at All," "A Little," "Quite a Bit," and "Very Much". Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores indicate better unctioning, better HRQoL, or greater level of symptom., approximately up to 42 months|The EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items), 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), and global health status/QoL scale, along with 5 individual item symptom scores (appetite loss, dyspnoea, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhoea. The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual (Fayers et al. 2001). Higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales/scores represent greater symptom severity., approximately up to 42 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) - time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1) or death in the absence of disease progression., Up to approximately 42 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - number of patients with complete or partial response or with stable disease maintained â‰¥24 weeks (as assessed by the investigator, using RECIST 1.1) divided by the number of patients in the analysis, Up to approximately 42 months
