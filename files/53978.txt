Clinical Outcomes of the Endoscopic Resection of Premalignant and Malignant Gastrointestinal Lesions
To evaluate clinical outcome for patients receiving treatment of suspected premalignant and malignant gastrointestinal lesions at Interventional Endoscopy Services. The primary outcome is curative endoscopic resection. Secondary outcomes include resection technique utilized, rates of en bloc resection and adverse event rates, including infection, bleeding, perforation and death, and one-year survival rates.
