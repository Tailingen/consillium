Continuation Study of Entinostat in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The objectives of this study are to explore different dosing levels and schedules of entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors, in terms of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), impact on immune correlatives, and efficacy

Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) resulting in the permanent discontinuation of study drug, and deaths occurring within the reporting period required for the study, Each treatment cycle is 21 days. All events will be collected from informed consent through 90 days post-last dose or through 30 days after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy|Changes from baseline in laboratory results, Baseline through 90 day safety follow-up visit|Changes from baseline in vital signs, Baseline through 90 day safety follow-up visit|Changes from baseline in ECG results, Baseline through 90 day safety follow-up visit

This is a Phase 1, open-label, single center, randomized study to assess the safety and tolerability of 3 different dose regimens of entinostat in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors who previously completed Study SNDX-275-0140 (NCT02897778). Up to 30 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three arms. In the event that greater than or equal to 2 out of the first 6 patients randomized experience a dose-limiting toxicity, the next patient randomized to that Arm will receive treatment at a reduced starting dose as outlined in the protocol.
