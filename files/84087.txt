Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Patient-Derived Xenografts
The investigators will establish a platform at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to generate novel models of estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, which will be used for research studies to develop novel treatment strategies and dissect signaling pathways underlying drug sensitivity and resistance.
