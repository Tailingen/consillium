Prospective Randomized Study Comparing One or Two High Dose Chemotherapy Regimen Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
First randomization:

After inclusion Use of Daunorubicin (arm D) or Idarubicin (arm I) as anthracyclin during all courses of chemotherapy (induction, consolidation courses before ASCT)

Second randomization:

After achieving 1st CR: all patients received non intensive consolidation course Familial HLA typing required for all patients

Patients with HLA-identical sibling:

Patients with very good prognostic factors (CBF leukemias, WBC \< 30 giga/l at diagnosis, 1st CR after one induction course) = arm C: no allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 1st CR; received 2 more courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy All others patients received an allogeneic transplant For patients aged less than 51 = arm M: upfront myeloablative conditioning regimen For patients aged over 51 and less than 61= arm m: intensive chemotherapy consolidation course.
