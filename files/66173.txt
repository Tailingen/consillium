Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy Followed by Chemotherapy in Patients With Endometrioid Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival of patients with surgically staged, Stage I-II papillary serous, clear cell, or endometrioid carcinomas with high-intermediate risk factors treated by vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed by chemotherapy.
Endometrial Cancer|Papillary Serous|Clear Cell Endometrial Cancer
RADIATION: Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy
Number of Patients With Progression-free Survival at 2 Years, 2 years
Number of Patients With at Least One Toxicity Related to Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy Followed by Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Chemotherapy, 2 years
All patients must have undergone complete surgical staging including bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. All patients will receive radiation therapy. Treatment will be delivered either by LDR or HDR brachytherapy. The treatment plan must be started at the time of enrollment. The vaginal brachytherapy should be started within 4 weeks of surgery (within 2 weeks of enrollment), in order to avoid delays in initiation of systemic therapy, which should start on post-operative day 21. The dose will be prescribed to the vaginal (mucosal) surface as defined at the surface of the applicators. Following vaginal cuff radiation therapy, all patients will receive chemotherapy.
