Dyspnea and Cardiotoxicity in Multiple Myeloma Patients Who Receive Carfilzomib
This study will explore why some multiple myeloma patients who receive carfilzomib (an anti-cancer medication) experience shortness of breath while others do not. The purpose of this research is to gather information on the effectiveness of the EndoPAT device, which is FDA-approved to assess the health of a patient's blood vessels. These assessments will help doctors leading the study determine the reasons why patients may develop shortness of breath (dyspnea) when being treated with carfilzomib and ways to better prevent this shortness of breath.

Endothelial Function and Dyspnea Associations in Multiple Myeloma Patients, The association between baseline endothelial function and dyspnea in myeloma patients treated with carfilzomib. These associations will be assessed by comparing endothelial function within two cohorts: patients with abnormal baseline endothelial function, and patients with normal baseline endothelial function. Baseline endothelial function will be measured using EndoPat, an FDA-approved device used for health tests. Dyspnea rates will be assessed by participant-reported outcomes using the FACIT Dyspnea-10 Raw Dyspnea Score and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V5., 2 months
Cardiovascular Toxicities Associated with Changes in Carfilzomib-Induced Endothelial Function, The association between changes in carfilzomib-induced endothelial function and frequency of cardiovascular toxicities stratified by patients with abnormal and normal baseline endothelial function.Cardiovascular toxicities in this study will be defined as new or worsening symptomatic heart failure, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias and thromboembolic events that will be measured per CTCAE V5., 2 months|The Affects of Carfilzomib Dose/Dosing Schedule on the Incidence of Dyspnea, The affects of carfilzomib dose/dosing schedule on how often participants experience dyspnea (shortness of breath) will be assessed by participant reported outcomes using the FACIT Dyspnea-10 (raw dyspnea score) and data collected on adverse events (side effects) using CTCAE V5., 2 months|Changes in Cardiovascular Physiology and Risk Factors Associated with Endothelial Function, To determine whether changes in endothelial function are associated with cardiovascular physiological changes and cardiovascular risk factors within participants receiving carfilzomib. These associations will be measured by: hemodynamics (using the average 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure reported by participants after treatment using home blood pressure monitoring), echocardiography using echocardiogram, and data collected on patient's vascular and cardiovascular health at baseline., 2 months
