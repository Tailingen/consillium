Summary of safety, The number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events, physical exam findings, vital signs, laboratory tests, ECG parameters and echocardiograph, Though study completion, an average of 24 months|To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if reached or maximum administered dose (MAD) and two or more recommended doses for dose expansion (RDEs) of BL-M07D1, Determine the highest BL-M07D1 dose level at which subjects do not experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period and highest BL-M07D1 dose administered in the event and MTD cannot be defined., 21 Days
BL-M07D1-ST-101 is a global, multi-center, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BL-M07D1 in participants with HER2 expressing advanced malignant solid tumors.

This study will be conducted in three parts (dose escalation, dose finding and dose expansion). Dosing will be conducted on Day 1 of a continuous 21-day treatment cycle. .
