Study of KN026 Combined With KN046 in Patients With Locally Advanced HER2-positive Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, phase II，multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KN026 in combination with KN046 in subjects with HER2-positive solid tumors.
HER2-positive Solid Tumors
DRUG: KN026 combination

Progression free survival (PFS) rates, Progression free survival (PFS) rates, 6 months and 12 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate, CBR calculated as the proportion of subjects with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD ≥24 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) rates, 6 months and 12 months
KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockade.KN046 is a PD-L1 - CTLA-4 bispecific antibody. The study composes of two stages. The first stage plans to enroll HER2-positive solid tumors. All subjects will be treated with KN026 at 30 mg/kg Q3W in combination with KN046 at 5 mg/kg Q3W at the first stage.A SMC meeting will decide whether to proceed to the nest stage.
