To Determine the Safety of Regorafenib, Hydroxychloroquine, and Entinostat Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to find the best dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when given in combination with regorafenib and entinostat.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: hydroxychloroquine|DRUG: entinostat|DRUG: regorafenib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Hydroxychloroquine and Entinostat in Combination With Regorafenib, Participants were evaluable for toxicity if they have taken one dose of HCQ and one dose of entinostat. To be considered for evaluability in a Phase I cohort in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, patients should have completed \> 85% of HCQ doses, and at least 3 of 4 entinostat doses. The MTD will be defined as a) the dose producing DLT in 1 out of 6 patients, or b) the dose level below the dose which produced DLT in ≥ 2 out of 3 patients, or in ≥ 2 out of 6 patients. DLTs will be defined by toxicity occurring during the first 4 weeks of this study., 18 months
This was a 3+3 phase I trial of HCQ and entinostat with regorafenib in patients with metastatic CRC. The primary objective was safety and the secondary objective was clinical efficacy. The trial was intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial, but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2.
