Coenzyme Q10 and Chemotherapeutic Toxicity in Breast Cancer Patients
investigating the potential effect of Coenzyme Q10 in ameliorating and preventing the development of paclitaxel chemotherapeutic toxicity in breast cancer patients
Breast Cancer|Chemotherapeutic Toxicity
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Coenzyme Q10 200mg twice daily
Clinical assessment of the possible effect of COQ10 on some of the expected paclitaxel adverse events using grading system provided by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 (V5), The primary endpoint is assessing the effect of coenzyme Q10 on the severity grades of the following adverse events : fatigue, sleep disturbance, peripheral neuropathy, nausea , vomiting , mucositis, Anemia , febrile neutropenia and pruritis.using the severity grades of common terminology criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) versi√≥n 5.The grades as follow

* Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
* Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)
* Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL.
* Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
* Grade 5 Death

grades are documented at baseline and weekly over 3 months., 3 months|The possible impact of COQ10 on peripheral neuropathy affecting patients' quality of life using Neurotoxicity-12 item questionnaire score (Ntx-12) from Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group (FACT/GOG-Ntx-12), The questionnaire is comprised of statements intended to measure the possible impact of COQ10 on peripheral sensory neuropathy symptoms interfering with patients' lives, which includes numbness or tingling in hands or feet, discomfort in hands or feet, joint pain, general weakness, trouble hearing, ringing or buzzing in ears, trouble with buttons, trouble feeling shape of objects in hands, trouble with walking, and pain in hands or feet when exposed to cold temperatures. At each cycle, each patient is instructed to choose severity of discomfort he feels with (0) indicating not at all; (1), a little bit; (2), somewhat; (3), quite a bit; and (4), very much. The sum of the score is obtained, This sum ranges from 0 to 48. The higher the score, the more severe is the neuropathy and a worse QOL, 3 months
1. Ethical committee approval is obtained from ethics committee of Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University.
2. All participants should agree to take part in this clinical study and will provide informed consent.
3. Forty female patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are candidates for will be recruited from Damanhour oncology center.
4. All enrolled patients will be randomly assigned into two arms:

   * Control arm (n=20): will receive 80 mg/m2 of paclitaxel chemotherapy weekly for 4 cycles (12 weeks) after receiving 4 cycles of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) protocol
   * Treatment arm (n=20): will receive the same regimen as control arm in addition to Coenzyme Q10 400 mg daily (200 mg twice daily).
5. All patients will be submitted to:

   * Full patient history and clinical examination.
   * Routine follow up before and after each chemotherapy cycle (complete blood picture, liver function tests, renal function tests).
   * Assessing the effect of coenzyme Q10 on the following: fatigue, sleep disturbance, peripheral neuropathy, nausea , vomiting , mucositis, Anemia , febrile neutropenia and pruritis using common terminology criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.
   * Assessing of the patient's QoL by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTx) subscale
