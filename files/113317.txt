TreAtments and outComes in paTients With prImary CutAneous Lymphoma
In order to further improve the diagnosis and treatment level of primary cutaneous lymphoma in China, the National Clinical Center for Skin and Immune Diseases established a standardized diagnosis and treatment center for primary cutaneous lymphoma to systematically and effectively understand the current treatment status of patients with primary cutaneous lymphoma, as well as the efficacy and safety of various treatment methods during practices, so as to further improve the diagnosis and treatment level of primary cutaneous lymphoma and help patients with primary cutaneous lymphoma.

Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs) are defined as non-Hodgkin lymphomas presenting in the skin with no evidence of extracutaneous disease at the time of diagnosis. Primary cutaneous lymphomas include a heterogeneous group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCLs). The different types of PCLs have highly characteristic clinical and histologic features, often a completely different clinical behavior and prognosis, and require a different type of treatment. Various studied in terms of the treatment and outcome of patients with different types of PCLs has been conducted in recent years. While the data of Chinese patients with PCLs are limited. Considering the different proportion of PCLs and limited treatment modalities in China, a nationwide multi-center prospective study is designed to summarize the current treatment status and outcome of patients.
