Safety and Efficacy of Oral Etoposide Combined With Antirotinib and Envollizumab in Elderly Patients With Lung Cancer
This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of etoposide capsules combined with anrotinib and Envollizumab in elderly patients with extensive small cell lung cancer.This is a single-center, single-arm exploratory clinical study. 30 patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer are scheduled to be enrolled. Treatment regimen is etoposide capsule 100mg PO qd\*7d, antirotinib 12mg PO qd\*14d, Emvolizumab 300mg/ IH Q3W, every 21 days, until disease progression or intolerable adverse reactions or death.
Progression Free Survival(PFS)
DRUG: Toposide capsules combined with anrotinib and Emvolizumab group
PFS (Progression-Free-Survival), The time from randomization to tumor progression or death.The efficacy of this study was determined according to Recist version 1.1 criteria., 30 months
OS (Overall survival time), The time of death from all causes for all patients from the date of randomization.The efficacy of this study was determined according to Recist version 1.1 criteria., 30 months|ORR (Objective response rate), Defined as complete response and partial response (CR+PR).The efficacy of this study was determined according to Recist version 1.1 criteria., 30 months|QOL (Quality of Life) assessed by the QLQ-C30 scale, It mainly refers to the state assessment of individual physiological, psychological and social functions, namely, health quality. The quality of life was assessed by the QLQ-C30 scale, 30 months|The Adverse Events, AEs are any adverse medical events that occur in a subject or clinical subject and is not necessarily causally related to the treatment. Safety assessment in this study was conducted by the investigator in accordance with the definition of NCI-CTC version 3.0., 30 months
The primary objective of this study was to explore the safety and median PFS of etoposide capsules combined with anrotinib and Envollizumab as first-line treatment in elderly patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer (as assessed by the investigators according to RECIST 1.1 criteria).The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the OS, ORR, and QOL of etoposide capsules combined with Emvolizumab and anrotinib as first-line treatment in elderly patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer.Exploratory aims are to explore predictive or prognostic biomarkers (tissue and/or plasma) associated with therapeutic response or resistance to disease; Analysis of potential biomarkers in biopsy tissue samples and blood samples after disease progression to explore possible mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. To provide a better treatment plan for elderly patients with extensive small cell lung cancer.
