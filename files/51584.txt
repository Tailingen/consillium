Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Two Supportive Cancer Care Delivery Models for Adults With Cancer
This cluster-randomized comparative effectiveness trial compares a technology-based supportive cancer care (SCC) approach with a redesigned team-based supportive cancer care (SCC) approach.
End of Life|Cancer
OTHER: Receive technology-based supportive cancer care|BEHAVIORAL: Receive redesigned team-based supportive cancer care

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Greater intervention effects on health-related quality of life

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Greater intervention effects on patient activation II. Greater satisfaction with care and decision-making III. Greater documentation of goals of care and symptoms IV. To lower acute care V. Greater palliative care and hospice

OUTLINE: Sites are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive educational materials to assist with advance care planning and symptom management through a technology-based supportive cancer care weekly during months 1-4 and every other week during months 5-12.

ARM B: Patients are paired with a lay health worker who will discuss the same educational materials from ARM A either in person or by telephone discussions weekly during months 1-4 and every other week during months 5-12.

All participants complete a baseline interview upon enrollment during the initial consent phone contact and then a survey at 3-, 6-and 12-months post enrollment.
