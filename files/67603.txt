Feasibility of Obtaining and Characterizing Circulating Tumorigenic Cells in Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples and study cancer cells found in these blood samples from patients with pancreatic cancer. Prior research has discovered that tumor cells can be collected from the blood of patients with pancreatic and other cancers.

The physicians have developed techniques for isolating and analyzing cancer cells using a simple blood test. They will study how these cells relate to how chemotherapy works. They hope to use this information to guide choices of treatment for patients in the future.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Blood draw
isolating and enriching circulating tumorigenic cells, A 10 mL blood sample will be drawn from participants prior to starting chemotherapy treatment. circulating tumorigenic cells from the peripheral blood of eligible pancreatic cancer patients. During the 1 year following enrollment, in the setting of disease progression, a subsequent 10 mL blood sample may be drawn from participants prior to changing chemotherapy treatment., 1 year
successful gene expression profiling, of these circulating tumorigenic cells. For each blood sample collected, CTCs will be isolated, expanded, RNA extracted, gene expresion analysis performed and treatment profile sensitivity performed., 1 year
