Prognostic Analysis of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With/Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced NPC Patients
This is a randomized,controlled,prospective phase III clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate acute toxicity and efficacy of concurrent cisplatin chemoradiation with or without capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy in Local Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma at High Risk of Distant Metastasis.Exploring an Individualized comprehensive treatment plan which is reasonable,effective,low toxicity and fitting with Modern radiotherapy techniques for Local Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma at High Risk of Distant Metastasis.

DRUG: IMRT combine with cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy|DRUG: IMRT combine with cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy plus capecitabine adjuvant chemotherapy
Distant metastasis-free survival, Defined as the time from date of recruitment to documented distant metastasis or death from any cause., Five year
Failure-free survival, Defined as the time from date of recruitment to documented relapse or death from any cause., Five year|Locoregional relapse-free survival, Defined as the time from date of recruitment to documented locoregional relapse or death from any cause., Five year|Overall survival, Defined as the time from date of recruitment to death from any cause., Five year|Acute toxicity, Acute toxicities were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) for chemotherapy-specific toxicities, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) radiation morbidity scoring criteria for radiotherapy-specific toxicities., three months after corresponding treatment|Late toxicity, Late toxicities were assessed annually using the RTOG radiation morbidity scoring criteria., Five year
