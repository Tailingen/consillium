To Explore the Protective Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination on Cancer Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2
For tumor patients, the virus antibody titer produced by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is often lower than that of normal people in a short period of time, but in the long run, it can significantly reduce the infection rate and fatality rate of the new coronavirus, and the adverse reactions are mild and there is no significant difference with normal people. However, there is still no real-world research data in China to prove the protective effect of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on patients with tumors infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To explore the protective effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected from cancer patients who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were previously vaccinated or unvaccinated. The SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM concentrations) were detected by micro-magnetic particle chemiluminescence method, and the differences were compared. The results of this real-world prospective cohort study can be used to guide the vaccination of cancer patients in clinical practice.
