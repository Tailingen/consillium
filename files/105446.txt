Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation and Subsequent Auto-Transplantation for Female Cancer Patients
Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation will be provided to cancer patients to allow them to have their fertility preserved.
Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Ovarian tissue freezing and subsequent auto-transplantation after thawing
Surgical complications, Surgical complications after ovarian tissue transplantation, 15 years
Pregnancy rate, Pregnancy rate after ovarian tissue transplantation, 15 years
This project hopes to provide Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation to patients who do not have adequate time for ovarian stimulation in oocyte or embryo freezing and in prepubertal girls where oocyte freezing is not possible. All the patients will have fertility preservation consultations with a fertility specialist in our unit to go through the details of ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation service and risks related to ovarian tissue cryopreservation procedures. After undergoing ovarian tissue collection via surgery, the collected ovarian tissue will be cryopreserved either by slow freezing or vitrification in our unit.
