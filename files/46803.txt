Fluzoparib Combined With Bevacizumab in PSROC Previously Treated With PARPi
There are more and more PARPi(PARP inhibitors) resistance for ovarian cancer patients after previous use of PARP inhibitors. Basic studies have found that there is synergistic effect of bevacizumab combined with PARPi. Therefore we designed the study to include 42 ovarian cancer patients who had PARPi for at least half a year and then relapsed (platinum-sensitive, previously 1-3 lines of chemotherapy). After getting complete remission or partial remission with chemotherapy containing platinum and bevacizumab, fluzopanib and bevacizumab were used for maintenance treatment. The progression-free survival, ORR, DCR, DoR, and safety were evaluated based on RECIST V1.1.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: fluzopanib and bevacizumab
PFS, progression-free survival was the maintenance time to progression or recurrence since the last platinum therapy based on RECIST v1.1, 5 years
OS, Overall survival, 5 years|ORR, Objective Response Rate, 5 years|DCR, Disease control rate, 5 years|DoR, Duration of remission, 5 years
saftey, The severity of adverse events was determined according to CTCAE V5.0 criteria. During the trial, the adverse event record form should be truthfully filled in, including the occurrence time, severity, correlation with study treatment, duration, measures taken and outcome of the adverse event, 5 years
Genetic testing of tissue samples before and after the maintenance therapy were also used to further explore the pattern of gene mutations and the subgroups who may benefit.
