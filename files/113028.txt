A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing the Adenoma Detection Yield of SC, AI and Combined AI and G-EYE®
This is a multicenter, 3-arm, randomized, open-label study. Subjects referred to colonoscopy for screening or surveillance will be randomized in a 2:5:5 into one of the following arms:

(i) Standard Colonoscopy (ii) Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™) (iii) Combined Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™) and G-EYE® Balloon Aided Colonoscopy
Colorectal (Colon or Rectal) Cancer|Adenoma
DEVICE: Standard Colonoscopy|DEVICE: Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™)|DEVICE: Combined Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™) and G-EYE® Balloon Aided Colonoscopy
Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC) (AI compared with AG), Adenoma detection yield, represented by Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC) of AI compared with APC of AG., Upon histology results (up to 30 days)
Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC) (SC compared with AG), Adenoma detection yield, represented by Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC) of SC compared with APC of AG, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)|Advanced Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (AAPC) (SC compared with AG), Advanced Adenoma detection yield, represented by Advanced Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (AAPC) of SC compared with AAPC of AG, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)
This is a multicenter, 3-arm, randomized, open-label study. Subjects referred to colonoscopy for screening or surveillance will be randomized in a 2:5:5 into one of the following arms:

(i) Standard Colonoscopy (ii) Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™) (iii) Combined Artificial Intelligence Aided Colonoscopy (GI Genius™) and G-EYE® Balloon Aided Colonoscopy Study aim is to compare the adenoma detection yield, expressed by Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC), of these 3 arms.
