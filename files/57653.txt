Adult Study: ABT-414 Alone or ABT-414 Plus Temozolomide vs. Lomustine or Temozolomide for Recurrent Glioblastoma Pediatric Study: Evaluation of ABT-414 in Children With High Grade Gliomas
This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) alone or with temozolomide versus temozolomide or lomustine alone in adult participants with recurrent glioblastoma. The study also included a substudy to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-414 in a pediatric population.

The study objectives were to assess whether depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) alone or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) improved overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, quality of life, neurological deterioration-free survival (NDFS), and steroid use compared to standard treatment with lomustine single agent or TMZ re-challenge in adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age with centrally-confirmed recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioblastoma. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of depatuxizumab mafodotin in children \<18 years of age was evaluated in a pediatric substudy. The EMEA-001732-PIP02-15 pediatric investigation plan was withdrawn on 07 July 2019 due to the discontinuation of the depatuxizumab mafodotin research program.
