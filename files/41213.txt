Combination Trial of Tipifarnib and Alpelisib in Adult Recurrent/ Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (R/M HNSCC)
This phase 1/2 combination trial of tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, and alpelisib, a PI3K inhibitor in participants with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whose tumors overexpress the HRAS protein and/or are PIK3CA-mutated and/or PIK3CA-amplified.
HNSCC
DRUG: Tipifarnib|DRUG: Alpelisib
To determine the recommended dose and regimen and evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of tipifarnib and alpelisib, Rate of DLT per dose level and Descriptive statistics of adverse events per the NCI CTCAE v 5.0, DLTs will be evaluated during the first 28 days (1 cycle) of combination therapy

Each cycle is 28 days.|AUC(tau) of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Area under the concentration-time curve during a dosage interval for single dose and multiple dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|AUC(0-infinity) of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity for single dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|CL/F of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Apparent total clearance of the drug after administration for single dose and multiple dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|Vd/F of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Apparent volume of distribution after administration for single dose and multiple dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|Half-life of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Time required for the amount of drug in the body to decrease by half for single dose and multiple dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|Accumulation ratio of tipifarnib and alpelisib when administered in combination, Ratio of accumulation of a drug after multiple doses compared to a single dose, Blood samples will be collected on day 1 and day 2 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and on day 1 of Cycle 3 through Cycle 6. Each cycle is 28 days.|Antitumor activity in terms of PFS and rate of PFS at 6 months, Median PFS and Proportion of participants alive and without progression at 6 months, Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) and rate of OS at 12 months, Median OS and Proportion of participants alive at 12 months, Up to approximately 3 years
