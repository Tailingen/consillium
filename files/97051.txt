Molecular Characterization of Penile Cancers in Developing Countries
This study explores penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) in Brazil, a rare cancer associated with factors like poor hygiene and HPV infection, using next-generation sequencing to investigate its genomic profiles in 24 deceased patients with advanced PSCC.
Penile Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Biomarker Profiling of Penile Carcinoma by NGS, The study employs state-of-the-art molecular analysis methods, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a targeted panel (FoundationONE CDx) that assesses 324 genes., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
This study focuses on penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC), a rare cancer that is more prevalent in underdeveloped regions such as Africa, Asia, and South America, with Brazil having one of the highest incidence rates due to socioeconomic factors. PSCC is primarily associated with risk factors like poor local hygiene, smoking history, phimosis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The research aims to understand the genomic profiles of PSCC and their correlation with clinical characteristics, particularly in circumcised vs. non-circumcised populations in Brazil. The study will employ next-generation sequencing (NGS) on tumor specimens from 23 deceased patients with advanced PSCC who received treatment in Brazilian cancer sites.
