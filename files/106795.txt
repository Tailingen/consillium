A Study of Novel Anti-cancer Agents in Patients With Previously Untreated NSCLC
This study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab and/or novel oncology therapies, with or without chemotherapy, for first-line Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Danvatirsen|DRUG: Oleclumab|DRUG: MEDI5752|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: AZD2936
Assessment of AEs by CTCAE v5.0, Assessment of safety and tolerability of each treatment arm, From informed consent until the safety follow-up visit 3 months after the last dose of study drug, or until the final data cut-off (DCO) date, whichever is earlier.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessment of the efficacy of each treatment arm according to RECIST 1.1. ORR: The percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed Investigator-assessed visit response of CR or PR, Tumor assessments every 6-9 weeks until week 48-54, then every 12 or 18 weeks, depending on treatment arm until the earliest of radiological progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or final DCO (approximately 4 months after last patient randomized).|Duration of Response (DoR), Assessment of the efficacy of each treatment arm according to RECIST 1.1. DoR: Time from date of first detection of objective response until the date of objective radiological disease progression, Tumor assessments every 6-9 weeks until week 48-54, then every 12 or 18 weeks, depending on treatment arm until the earliest of radiological progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or final DCO (approximately 4 months after last patient randomized).|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Assessment of the efficacy of each treatment arm according to RECIST 1.1. PFS: Time from date of treatment assignment until the date of objective radiological disease progression using RECIST 1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), Tumor assessments every 6-9 weeks until week 48-54, then every 12/18 weeks based on arm until progression, death, withdrawal or final DCO. Further PFS data will be collected until 6 months after last patient dosed or final DCO|Overall Survival (OS), OS: Time from date of treatment assignment until the date of death by any cause, OS data will be collected until death, 6 months after last patient dosed, or the final DCO date, whichever is earlier.|Blood concentration of durvalumab and novel oncology therapies, Drug concentration of durvalumab and novel oncology therapies, From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Cycle 6/7 Day 1 (21-28-day cycles) depending on arm, then every 3 cycles (except for Arms A5 & B5), at end of treatment (Arms A4 & B4, A5 & B5 only), and until 3 months following treatment discontinuation, or the final DCO date.|Frequency of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) for durvalumab and applicable novel oncology therapies, Investigation of the immunogenicity of durvalumab and each applicable novel oncology therapy in all applicable treatment arms, From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Cycle 6/7 Day 1 (21-28-day cycles) depending on arm, then every 3 or 6 cycles (except for arms A5&B5), at end of treatment (arms A4&B4, A5&B5 only), until 3/6 months after treatment discontinuation, or the final DCO date.
This is a Phase IB, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Durvalumab and/or Novel Oncology Therapies, With or Without Chemotherapy, for First-Line Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
