A Study of Atezolizumab (Anti-PD-L1 Antibody) as Adjuvant Therapy After Definitive Local Therapy in Patients With High-Risk Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab compared with placebo as adjuvant therapy after definitive local therapy in patients with high-risk locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)
Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Investigator-Assessed Event-Free Survival (INV-assessed EFS), EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence (per unequivocal radiographic evidence of local recurrence, new second primary SCCHN lesion, or development of distant metastasis), or disease progression \[per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)\] per assessment by investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SOD on study (including baseline). Participants without disease recurrence, progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization to the first documented disease recurrence, disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 5 years)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Data from participants who were alive at the time of the analysis was censored as of the last date they were known to be alive. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization to death from any cause (up to 5 years, 5 months)|Independent Review Facility (IRF) Assessed EFS, EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence (per unequivocal radiographic evidence of local recurrence, new second primary SCCHN lesion, or development of distant metastasis), or disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) per assessment by IRF, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SOD on study (including baseline). Participants without disease recurrence, progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization to the first documented disease recurrence, disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 5 years)|Percentage of Participants Event-Free for IRF-assessed EFS at 1, 2, 3, and 4 Years, EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence (per unequivocal radiographic evidence of local recurrence, new second primary SCCHN lesion, or development of distant metastasis), or disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) per assessment by IRF, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SOD on study (including baseline). Participants without disease recurrence, progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate percentage of participants who were event-free for EFS at 1, 2, 3 \& 4 years., From randomization to EFS event or date last known to be alive and event-free at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years|Percentage of Participants Event-Free for INV-assessed EFS at 1, 2, 3, and 4 Years, EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence (per unequivocal radiographic evidence of local recurrence, new second primary SCCHN lesion, or development of distant metastasis), or disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) per assessment by the investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SOD on study (including baseline). Participants without disease recurrence, progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate percentage of participants who were event-free for EFS at 1, 2, 3 \& 4 years., From randomization to EFS event or date last known to be alive and event-free at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years|Percentage of Participants Event-Free for OS at 2, 3, and 5 Years, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Data from participants who were alive at the time of the analysis was censored as of the last date they were known to be alive. Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate the percentage of participants who were event-free for OS at 2, 3 and 5 years., From randomization to OS event or date last known to be alive at 2, 3, and 5 Years|Change From Baseline in Physical Function (PF) as Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 scale consists of 30 questions that assess participant functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), symptoms (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life (QoL), and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Change in PF was assessed using the PF scale, where participant responses to 5 questions about daily activities (strenuous activities, long walks, short walks, bed/chair rest \& needing help with eating, dressing, washing themselves, or using the toilet) was scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Scores were linearly transformed on a scale of 0 to 100, with a high score indicating worst functioning., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 16 (Cycle length = 21 days); study discontinuation visit (up to 1 year); Follow-up approximately every 3 months until disease recurrence or progression (up to approximately 4.5 years)|Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 scale consists of 30 questions that assess participant functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), symptom (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life (QoL), and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Change in HRQoL was assessed using participant responses to questions regarding Global Health Status (Question 29: GHS; "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?") and QoL (Question 30: QoL; "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") were scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized. Scores range from 0-100. A higher score indicates a better outcome., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 16 (Cycle length = 21 days); study discontinuation visit (up to 1 year); Follow-up approximately every 3 months until disease recurrence or progression (up to approximately 4.5 years)|Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is untoward medical occurrence in participant administered a pharmaceutical product \& regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable \& unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom/disease temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product., From first dose of study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 1 year, 3 months)|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, Predose and 0.5 hours post dose on Cycle 1 Day 1; Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, and 16 (Cycle length=21 days); study discontinuation visit (up to 1 year)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to Atezolizumab, Number of participants positive for Treatment Emergent ADA is the number of post-baseline evaluable participants determined to have treatment induced ADA or treatment-enhanced ADA during the study period., Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 (Cycle length=21 days)
