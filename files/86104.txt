Efficacy and Safety Study of Sorafenib to Treat Advanced Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
The purpose of his study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sorafenib versus placebo in subjects with locally advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The primary study objective is to compare the Progression-free Survival (PFS) of the Sorafenib treatment group with the placebo treatment group in patients with advanced MTC.
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The proportion of patients with PFS in the Sorafenib group and the Placebo group will be compared by log rank test and Kaplan-Meier plot., from the date of randomisation until the date of radiological or biochemical progression or death. An average of 9 months is assumed.
Time to Progression (TPP), The average TTP in the Sorafenib group and the Placebo group will be compared., from the date of randomisation until the date of confirmed radiological or biochemical progression. An average of 9 months is assumed.
Overall Survival (OS), The proportion of surviving patients in the Sorafenib group and the Placebo group will be compared., from the date of randomisation until the date of death due to any cause. Final assessment at the end of study after approximately 36 months.
