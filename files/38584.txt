For subjects who were lost to follow-up before death, the last follow-up time is usually calculated as the time of death., Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up|Progression-free survival, It is defined as the time between the start date of enrollment and the date of imaging progression or all-cause death evaluated by the investigator., Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up|The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and severe adverse events (SAE), The definitions and severity grading of AE and SAE refer to the corresponding descriptions in the definition and evaluation section of AE. The incidence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with AE and SAE to the corresponding total population., Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up|The incidence and severity of ADR, severe adverse reactions (SADR), suspicious and unexpected severe adverse reactions (SUSAR), The definitions and severity grading of ADR, severe ADR, and SUSAR refer to the corresponding descriptions in the definition and evaluation section of AE. The incidence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with ADR, severe ADR, and SUSAR to the corresponding total population., Start of treatment until 2-year follow-up
