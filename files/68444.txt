Correlation Between RECIST, Morphologic Response by CT- Histopathologic Response in Hepatic Metastasis Secondary to Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to to evaluate the correlation of overall objective response according to RECIST v1.1. criteria evaluated by conventional imaging techniques, morphologic response by CT, and histopathologic response in patients with resectable hepatic metastasis secondary to colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab in combination with XELOX.
