OH2 Oncolytic Viral Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer
This phase Ib/II study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 in patients with locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed first-line standard treatment.

OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.
