Cell-free Circulating DNA in Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas
To evaluate the possibility of detecting cell-free circulating tumoral DNA in potentially aggressive primary cutaneous lymphomas, the investigator opted to search a representative tumor sample mutation in the blood of these patients, by digital PCR. Patients with mycosis fungoides, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma helper follicular phenotype and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type will be included and 4 blood samples will be collected during 12 months.

Primary cutaneous lymphomas represent the second extra nodal localization of lymphomas, and are constituted by T-cell and B-cell phenotype lymphomas. Mycosis fungoides, a T-cell epidermotropic lymphoma, is the most frequent. Its clinical behavior is usually indolent but some patients have an aggressive evolution. Among B-cell cutaneous lymphomas, primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT) is the most aggressive. Cytogenetic and molecular studies on these tumours led to a genetic characterization of these entities. Therefore, there is not any biologic marker that can help monitoring these lymphomas. In solid tumors, mutations exhibited by the tumour tissue has been detected in plasma of patients, assessing the possibility to detect cell-free circulating tumoral DNA in a blood sample, with correlations with clinical characteristics and metastatic outcome. The concept of liquid biopsies, allowing the detection of tumour mutation in plasma has been validated in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. That's why the purpose is to evaluate the possibility to detect cell-free circulating tumoral DNA in primary cutaneous lymphomas, using a highly sensitive method (digital PCR), combined with a next generation sequencing panel of the tumour sample.
