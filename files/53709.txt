Dovitinib Plus an Aromatase Inhibitor for Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is for women with confirmed hormone receptor positive HER-2 negative advanced breast cancer with evidence of disease resistance to an aromatase inhibitor.

The purpose of this study is to determine how well these medications work together and/or if they have any side effects in patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer who have demonstrated progression of disease after first line hormonal therapy.

This research is being done to determine if taking an already approved medicine (aromatase inhibitor) in combination with a new medication (dovitinib) results in better outcomes for patients with this disease.

Both dovitinib and an aromatase inhibitor are pills that will be taken at home.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dovitinib|DRUG: Aromatase Inhibitors
Clinical Benefit Rate, Complete response, partial response, or stable disease at 24 weeks from trial entry as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, 24 weeks
Recommended Phase 2 Dose, The dose of dovitinib at which 1 or less subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity when administered every day for 5 days followed by 2 days off schedule in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, 4 weeks|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing adverse events, 24 weeks|Pharmacodynamic Effects, Expression of pFGFR, pFRS2, pERK in tumor tissue and VEGF, bFGF, PLGF, sVEGFR1/2 and FGF23 levels in plasma, 24 weeks|Progression-free Survival, Length of time from study entry until progressive disease, 24 weeks
This is a Phase I/Phase II open-label single arm trial of dovitinib in combination with anastrozole 1 mg daily, exemestane 25 mg daily, or letrozole 2.5 mg daily. Study subjects will receive the aromatase inhibitor on which they had previously derived clinical benefit.
