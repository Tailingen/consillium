Improving Cardiac Secondary Prevention
The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing individuals with personalized information on cellular aging, including telomere length, will stimulate them to adhere to cardiac prevention strategies and improve exercise capacity.
Myocardial Infarction|Secondary Prevention
BEHAVIORAL: Education regarding telomere length
Exercise capacity based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Online VO2 maximum, after 6-month cardiac rehabilitation program
Adherence to supervised exercise sessions, Proportion of prescribed supervised on-site exercise sessions attended, 6 months|Activity assessment, Garmin recording, 6 months
Individuals who have sustained a heart attack are at considerable risk for future cardiac events. A cardiac rehabilitation and exercise program can reduce this risk but it remains a challenge to adopt optimum lifestyle changes. We will determine whether providing individuals with information on leukocyte telomere length, will motivate them to improve their exercise performance. We will test whether professionally conveying this information will stimulate an individual to adhere to proven cardiac prevention strategies, looking at the extent to which one's exercise capacity improves over time.
