Study of CAR-BCMA, a Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell (CAR-T) Therapy Directed Against BCMA in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
This is an open label, abbreviated (3+3) dose escalation study in subjects with RRMM, followed by an extension phase at the selected safe dose. The dose escalation stage will involve recruitment of 3 RRMM patients for 'low' dose (6 x 106 CAR-T cells/kg) CAR-T therapy. After 14 days of follow-up for each of the 3 subjects, the DSC will determine whether the next subject can be recruited.

After 14 days follow-up for the 3rd subject, DSC will review data for the 3rd subject and consider the data for the first 3 subjects. In the absence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the DSC may recommend recruitment of 3 subjects to be treated with the 'high' dose (9x106 CAR-T cells/kg) CAR-T therapy, with similar staggering. In case of DLTs in one of the 3 low dose subjects, the DSC may recommend to recruit an additional 3 low dose subjects (6 in total). If there are no additional DLTs in these 3 patients the low dose may be recommended by the DSC for the extension stage. However, further DLTs may prompt the DSC to recommend to modify the protocol, or to stop the study. In case of DLTs in one of the first 3 high dose subjects, the DSC may recommend to recruit an additional 3 high dose subjects.If there are no additional DLTs in these 3 patients, the high dose may be recommended by the DSC for the study extension stage. However, further DLTs may prompt the DSC to recommend continuation to the extension stage with the low dose, or to modify the protocol, or to stop the study.

After completion of two months follow-up for the 6th subject in the low or high dose cohort (as applicable), and review of all the data for all subjects, following DSC recommendations, the Stage 2 extension phase of the study may recruit additional subjects, up to a maximum of 75 subjects for Stages 1 and 2, combined.

DSC will review study data during the extension stage follow-up after 5 years to determine if additional safety follow-up is required.
