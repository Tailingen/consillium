Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With HER2-mutated Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants who had disease recurrence or progression during/after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy (second line or later) that must have contained a platinum-based chemotherapy drug.

DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan
Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response Rate by Blinded Independent Central Review Following Intravenous Administration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), was assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., 9 months after the last participant is randomized to data cut off, up to approximately 21 months

CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., 9 months after the last participant is randomized or later to data cut off, up to approximately 35 months|Progression-free Survival Following Intravenous Administration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization until first objective radiographic tumor progression or death from any cause, based on blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigator assessment., 9 months after the last participant is randomized or later to data cut off, up to approximately 35 months|Overall Survival Following Intravenous Administration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Tumors, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization until death from any cause., 9 months after the last participant is randomized or later to data cut off, up to approximately 35 months|The Percentage of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following Intravenous Administration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Tumors, 9 months after the last participant is randomized or later to data cut off, up to approximately 35 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Total Anti-HER2 Antibody, and Active Metabolite MAAA-1181a, Cycle 1 Day 1; Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1: pre- and post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8: 7 days post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: 14 days post-dose; Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1: pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Minimum Observed Concentration (Ctrough) for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Total Anti-HER2 Antibody, and Active Metabolite MAAA-1181a, Cycle 1 Day 1; Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1: pre- and post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8: 7 days post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: 14 days post-dose; Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1: pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Total Anti-HER2 Antibody, and Active Metabolite MAAA-1181a, Cycle 1 Day 1; Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1: pre- and post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8: 7 days post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: 14 days post-dose; Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1: pre-dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Following Intravenous Administration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Tumors, Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 4, and then every 4 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for Lung Cancer Trials (QLQ-LC13) Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions assessing global health-related quality of life, five aspects of subject functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and six single-items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores for functioning scales and global health status indicate a better level of functioning while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms. The QLQ-LC13 is a 13-item questionnaire designed to assess lung cancer-related symptoms and treatment side effects. The scales ranges from 1=not at all to 4=very much. The summation of scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent increasing symptoms levels.

This randomized, two-arm, phase 2, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) in participants with HER2-mutated metastatic NSCLC. Each participant is expected to receive approximately 14 months of trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment. The primary endpoint of the study will be confirmed objective response rate (blinded independent central review). Secondary endpoints will include, but not limited to, disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, objective response rate (investigator), overall survival, and safety.
