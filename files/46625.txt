An Open-Label Study of the Safety of an Anti-CD38 Antibody Drug Conjugate (STI-6129) in Patients With AL Amyloidosis
This is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation trial designed to identify the recommended phase 2 dose of STI-6129 by assessing the safety, preliminary efficacy, and immunogenicity in subjects with relapsed or refractory systemic AL Amyloidosis
Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis
BIOLOGICAL: STI-6129
Safety of STI-6129, Safety as assessed by incidence of adverse events (AEs), severe AEs (SAEs), DLTs, neurotoxicity and laboratory abnormalities using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 5), Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 24 months
Overall hematological response rate according to the 2012 Consensus Round Table response criteria, Proportion of subjects with Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), No Response (NR) and Progressive Disease (PD), Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 24 months|Organ response rates (cardiac, renal, hepatic, peripheral nervous system) according to the 2012 Consensus Round Table response criteria, Organ response rates (cardiac, renal, hepatic, peripheral nervous system) according to the 2012 Consensus Round Table response criteria, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 24 months|Correlation of treatment response (organ responses and hematological response) with disease severity based on the 2012 revised Mayo Clinic staging system for AL amyloidosis, Correlation of treatment response (organ responses and hematological response) with disease severity based on the 2012 revised Mayo Clinic staging system for AL amyloidosis, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 24 months|Plasma levels of the total antibody plus conjugated toxin (STI-6129) and the free toxin (Duostatin 5.2), Plasma levels of the total antibody plus conjugated toxin (STI-6129) and the free toxin (Duostatin 5.2) by ELISA and mass spectrophotometry assays, respectively, at pre-dose and various time points post-dose, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 24 months
This study is an open-label, dose-finding, to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of STI-6129 by assessing the safety, and pharmacokinetics for the treatment of RRAL which is defined as the development of disease progression during therapy with an anti-AL amyloidosis treatment regimen or within 60 days of the last dose of an anti-AL amyloidosis treatment regimen or the achievement of less than a PR after â‰¥ 2 cycles.

The trial is the dose-escalation study. A standard dose escalation 3+3 will be utilized to identify dose-limiting toxiticy (DLTs) and a safe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI-6129 in patients with R/R systemic AL amyloidosis. A total of 6 dosing cohorts are planned from 0.88 mg/kg to 3.68 mg/kg. Approximate dosing increments between cohorts are 1.33x up to the maximum planned dose level.
