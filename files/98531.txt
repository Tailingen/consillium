Docetaxel Plus Capecitabine in Newly Diagnosed Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
Purpose: The purpose of this clinical trial is to look at the chemotherapy combination of docetaxel and capecitabine in the treatment of newly diagnosed or locally advanced prostate cancer, and to determine if this treatment is an acceptable, effective and a safe treatment option. In addition, this clinical trial will evaluate how this treatment affects chemicals (enzymes), and other cancer related genetic changes in the tumor. Optional: This clinical trial will conduct extra imaging studies for research purposes including combined endorectal prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRSI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to evaluate prostate cancer and response to study treatment.

The percentage of patients who respond to treatment, To evaluate the response rate associated with capecitabine and docetaxel combination chemotherapy in selected patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. Response is defined as a reduction in the PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) by at least 50%., 6 months
