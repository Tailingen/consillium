Fludarabine and Total-Body Irradiation in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery
RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine together with total-body irradiation works in treating patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for metastatic kidney cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
Kidney Cancer
DRUG: cyclosporine|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: mycophenolate mofetil|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Response rate (complete and partial response) at 6 and 12 months after transplantation
Severity of graft-vs-host-disease by Glucksburg Scale after transplantation for up to 5 years|Incidence of graft rejection based on donor chimerims after transplantation for up to 5 years|Non-relapse mortality as assessed by Kaplan-Meier after transplantation for up to 5 years|Disease-free survival as assessed by Kaplan-Meier after transplantation for up to 5 years|Overall survival as assessed by Kaplan-Meier after transplantation for up to 5 years|Toxicity as measured by CTC AE v 3.0 100 days after transplantation
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising fludarabine and total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in terms of 6-month and 12-month response rate, in patients with unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

OUTLINE:

* Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2 and total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.
* Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT): After TBI, patients undergo AHSCT on day 0.
* Immunosuppression: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 56 followed by a taper until day 81. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-27 (if patient has a related donor) OR three times daily on days 0-29 and then twice daily on days 30-149 followed by additional tapering until day 180 (if patient has an unrelated donor).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
