Ascertainment of Saliva or Blood Samples For Genetic Epidemiology Studies of Cancer and Aging
The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about the roles of genes in cancers. Genes are short pieces of DNA which determine the inherited characteristics that distinguish one individual from another. This study will look at how some genes might raise or lower the chance some people may develop cancer. The sample collection will help generate the materials needed for this study.
Non-cancer Affected Volunteers
OTHER: Saliva or Blood samples
obtain saliva or blood from non-cancer volunteers, 60 years or older to carry out anonymous genetic epidemiology studies related to resistance to cancer in elderly., conclusion of the study
samples perform high density genomic scans & candid gene studies carriers specif BRCA found mutat who haven't been affect by breast cancer & old than 60 find genetic cofactor may modify a predispo breast ca confer by germline mutation in BRCA1 & BRCA2., conclusion of the study
This is a protocol to obtain saliva or blood samples from non-cancer affected volunteers aged 60 years or older, without a history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. These samples will be used in a genomic approach to elucidate novel pathways of cancer predisposition.
