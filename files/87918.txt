Evaluating in Vivo PARP-1 Expression With 18F-FluorThanatrace Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) in Breast Cancer
Up to 30 evaluable participants with known or suspected breast cancer (BIRADS 5 by imaging) will undergo FTT PET/CT imaging before primary surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy may choose to have a second FTT PET/CT scan after the start of therapy (1 days to 3 weeks). FTT PET/CT uptake will be correlated with pathology measures and treatment response, in subjects undergoing neoadjuvant therapy
