TN Induction and Adjuvant Therapy for Resectable Local Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Investigators target recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma that can be resected surgically: rT1, rT2 (tumor confined to the surface of the parapharyngeal space, greater than 0.5cm from the internal carotid artery), rT3 (confined to the floor of the sphenoid sinus, greater than 0.5cm from the internal carotid artery/cavernous sinus) (AJCC 8th stage), A single-arm, phase II clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of triplizumab combined with nituzumab in induction and adjuvant treatment of operable local recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The investigators focus on the 2-year PFS as the primary outcome.
