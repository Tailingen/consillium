Number of participants of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) with GAIA-102 (Phase I), DLT was evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 and is defided following events: 1. Grade 4 hemotoxicity or hemotoxicity requiring blood transfusion. 2. Grade 3 or higher non-hematoxicity, Cycle 1 (Cycle period is 28 days)|Frequency and severity of adverse events(Phase I), 2 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 6 months (Phase II), PFS rate at 6 months was defined as the rate of surviving participants who survived or were not determined as progressive at 6 months from the day of enrollment., Week 24
