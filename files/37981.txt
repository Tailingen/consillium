Feasibility of Interval Debulking Surgery by Laparoscopy for Peritoneal Carcinosis in Chemosensitive Patients
This prospective nonrandomized multicenter phase II study, will evaluate the possibility of performing a laparoscopic interval debulking after a minimum of 3 cycles of chemotherapy in highly chemo-sensitive patients with advanced ovarian, tubal cancer or primary peritoneal.
