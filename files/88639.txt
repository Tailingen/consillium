The Biomarker Exploratory Study in Prospective Multicenter Observational Study of Atezolizumab Combination Therapy in Lung Cancer (J-TAIL-2)
This study is implemented in association with the study "J-TAIL-2" ; prospective multicenter observational study of atezolizumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, UMIN study ID: UMIN000041263, to evaluate biomarkers for selection of appropriate patients in treatment with atezolizumab combination therapy.
