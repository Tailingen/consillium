A Phase 1 Study of CC-486 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Carboplatin or ABI-007 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and to define the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the Maximal Administered Dose (MAD) of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with carboplatin (CBDCA) or paclitaxel protein bound particles (ABI-007,ABX) in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

Number of participants with adverse events, An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity., Up to 3 years
Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in plasma (Cmax), Up to 30 days|AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Up to 30 days|Tmax, Time to maximum concentration (tmax);, Up to 30 days|T1/2, Terminal half-life (t1/2), Up to 30 days|CL/F, Apparent total body clearance (CL/F), Up to 30 days|Vz/F, Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F)., Up to 30 days|DNA Methylation, Change from baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) in DNA methylation (global and gene-specific assays) in whole blood and tumor tissue (as available in Part 1), Up to 30 days|DNMT1 protein levels, Reduction from baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 predose) in DNMT1 protein levels in tumor tissue (as available in Part 1), Up to 30 days|Tumor Response Rate, Response and progression were evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Treatment response includes both complete response and partial response.

* Complete response-disappearance of all lesions
* Partial response-30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline, Up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the start of disease progression or patient death, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as progression-free survival in responders, i.e. as the time between the start of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the start of progressive disease (PD) or patient death from any cause, whichever occurred first, Up to 3 years
