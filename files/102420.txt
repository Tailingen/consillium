Immunotherapy After Radiotherapy in Elderly ESCC
The incidence and mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are at the forefront in China.Most part of patients are elderly. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Most elderly patients cannot tolerate concurrent chemotherapy because of complications and other reasons. Immunotherapy has definite efficacy and low toxicity in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and the results combined with radiotherapy have also been preliminarily reported. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by AJCC V8 Stage
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Toripalimab
Progression-free survival (PFS), We aim to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of elderly patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were unable to accept concurrent chemotherapy and received sequential treatment with Triptolide injection after radiotherapy alone., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence ., 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) to treatment according to RECIST v1.1., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) was determined from date of initial response to PD according to RECIST v1.1., 2 years|Time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM), Time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) according to RECIST v1.1., 2 years
This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase â…¡ clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy alone followed by sequential injection of Toripalimab in elderly patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who could not accept concurrent chemotherapy.
