Lymph Node Metastases and Arterial Ligation in Rectal Cancer Surgery
Lymph node status is of major prognostic importance in non-metastatic rectal cancer. For oncological reasons, central arterial ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) is suggested. However, there is no conclusive evidence presented for this procedure.

This study aimed at investigating the localisation of lymph node metastases and the role of central versus peripheral arterial ligation of in rectal cancer specimens.
Lymph Node Metastases
Lymph node metastases in rectal cancer, Analyses of number and location of lymph node metastases in rectal cancer, 2012-2016
Prospective population-based study of specimens from patients that underwent surgical resection for rectal cancer in VÃ¤stmanland County, Sweden. Specimens were divided in 3 sections (A-C) and the total amount of lymph nodes and the location of lymph node metastases were analysed.

Multivariate analysis was used to explore the relationship between lymph node counts and age, gender, BMI, preoperative oncological treatment, type of surgery, tumour stage, vessel and specimen length.
