Treatment With Olverembatinib in CML-CP Patients Who Failed to at Least Two Previously Administered Second-generation TKIs.
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olverembatinib(HQP1351) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) who are resistant and/or intolerant to at least two second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The efficacy of olverembatinib is determined by evaluating the major molecular responses(MMR) at the and of 12 months.
