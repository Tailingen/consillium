MG4101 Plus Rituximab Including Lymphodepletion in Patient With r/r NHL B-cell Origin
To determine the efficacy and safety of combined therapy of determined MG4101 dose and Rituximab.
Relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: MG4101(allogeneic Natural Killer cell)|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Phase I - Maximum Tolerated Dose of the dose of MG4101 in combination with Rituximab, Dose-Limiting Toxicity assessment, 28 days|Phase II - Objective Response Rate, central review by Positron Emission Tomograph-CT, up to 3 years
Phase I - Objective Response Rate, investigator review by Positron Emission Tomograph-CT, 1 years|Phase II - Complete Response, Complete Response Rate, up to 3 years|Phase II -Partial Response, Partial Response rate, up to 3 years|Phase II - Overall Survival, every 12 weeks after End Of Treatment, up to 3 years|Phase II - Time To Progression, every 12 weeks after End Of Treatment, up to 3 years|Phase II - Time to Response, every 12 weeks after End Of Treatment, up to 3 years
This trial will consist of 3 parts; Phase 1 Maximum Tolerated Dose, Phase 1 extended cohort and Phase 2a.

For Phase 1, those who have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) of B-cell Origin of any subtype will be considered eligible for enrolment. Each cycle last approximately 28 days.

Once the dose of MG4101 is determined from Phase 1, Phase 2a will commence whereby two subgroups of patients will be enrolled and will similarly receive up to 6 cycles of treatment with the recommended Phase 2a dose of MG4101. The 2 subgroups are patients with indolent and aggressive NHL of B-cell origin respectively.
