Study of Anti-5T4 CAR-NK Cell Therapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an interventional, single arm, open-label, investigator-initiated trial (IIT) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, initial efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CAR-NK Cells
Number of Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate the safety and tolerability of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells, From day 1 to day 90 after the last dose
Objective response rate (ORR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Overall survival (OS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Disease control rate (DCR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of anti-5T4 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Cytokine release, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the cytokine (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, hsCRP) concentration (pg/mL), Up to 1 year|Lymphocyte subtype, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to analyze the lymphocyte subtypes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56), Up to 1 year
The treatment cycle in this study is 21 days. The administration of CAR-NK cell will be performed on day 1 and day 3 of each cycle. Subjects will be treated continuously until the criteria for termination of treatment are met. In this study, the dose escalation design is adopted. The first administration dose in the first cycle is 3.0×10\^9 cells. If no adverse events were observed, the second administration dose in the first cycle would be 4.0×10\^9 cells, and each administration dose in the second cycle and thereafter would be 4.0×10\^9 cells.
