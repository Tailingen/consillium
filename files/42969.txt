(HARMONY) Study of BLU-701 in EGFR-mutant NSCLC
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of BLU-701 as monotherapy or in combination with either osimertinib or platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with EGFRm NSCLC.

The study was planned to include an initial Phase 1 portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BLU-701 as monotherapy (Part 1A; initially in a once daily (QD) regimen with the option to evaluate twice daily (BID) dosing if supported by emerging PK and safety data), as well as additional dose-escalation portions to determine the RP2D of BLU-701 in combination with osimertinib (Part 1B) or in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Part 1C). A Phase 2 part was planned to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLU-701 as monotherapy at RP2D (Part 2A). Phase 1 Part 1 A was initiated; however, the study was terminated prior to establishing BLU-701 MTD and/or RP2D.
