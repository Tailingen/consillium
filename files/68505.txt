PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test the feasibility and acceptability of an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) driven Survivorship Care Planning (SCP) intervention for colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survivors.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Development of the infrastructure and strategy for a larger comparative intervention study.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo Survivorship Care Planning comprising disease surveillance, management of potential long-term and late effects, psycho-social-spiritual issues, and healthy living recommendations.
