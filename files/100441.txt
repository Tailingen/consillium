HRQOL in Locally Advanced Thyroid Carcinoma
The purpose of this study was to explore the changes of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with locally advanced thyroid cancer (LATC) receiving TKI drugs (anlotinib, lenvatinib, etc.).

Surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment for thyroid cancer. However, some patients present with locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, and they are not eligible for radical resection. Another patients still had the risk of recurrence after surgery, endocrine therapy and iodine-131 treatment. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been proved to be effective in thyroid cancer patients. However, it was still unclear whether TKI drugs had influence on the HRQOL of LATC patients. The purpose of this study was to explore the changes of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with locally advanced thyroid cancer (LATC) receiving TKI drugs (anlotinib, lenvatinib, etc.).Participants enroll the study after informed consent, and quality of life will be assessed using quality of life questionnaires EORTC QLQ C30, and EORTC THY 47 before surgery, and 1,3,6 and 12 months after treatment.
