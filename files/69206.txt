Study to Gather Information How Often Venous Thromboembolism Occurs in Prostate Cancer Patients in Sweden and How This Condition is Treated With Blood Thinners
Patients with cancer are at a significantly increased risk of experiencing a venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is defined by a blood clot in the leg or lower extremity (deep vein thrombosis) or a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and is a leading cause of condition of being diseased and death among cancer patients. The goal of the study is to gather information how often venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in prostate cancer patients in Sweden and how this condition is treated with blood thinners.
