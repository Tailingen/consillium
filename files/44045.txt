Adjuvant Radiotherapy in High Risk Locally Advanced DTC
This study is a phase III randomized controlled clinical trial on the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in high-risk locally advanced differentiated thyroid cancer. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the experimental group (adjuvant radiotherapy+RAI) or the control group (RAI), with LRFS as the primary endpoint of the study.
Thyroid Cancer
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|OTHER: radioiodine treatment
Local-regional Recurrence Free Survival （LRFS）, The time from surgery to the occurrence of local-regional tumor recurrence based on the RECIST 1.1. The definition of local areas includes thyroid area, cervical I-VII lymph nodes, and retropharyngeal lymph nodes., 5 years after surgery
Local-regional Recurrence Rate，LRR, The percentage of patients with local-regional recurrence in the total number of patients., 5 years after surgery|Progression Free Survival，PFS, The time from surgery to tumor progression, including local recurrence and distant metastasis., 5 years after surgery|Overall Survival，OS, The time from surgery to patient death., 5 years after surgery|Adverse Events，AE, The name of AE (based on NCI-CTCAE V5.0 criteria), severity, duration, and correlation with radiotherapy;, 5 years after surgery|Quality of Life as assessed by QLQ-H&N35, Patients in the experimental group were evaluated for QoL within 1 week before the start of radiotherapy, 1 week after the end of radiotherapy, 3 months after the end of radiotherapy, and 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. The control group patients were evaluated for QoL at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after surgery. The QoL evaluation scale adopts the EORTC Quality of Life Measurement Scale QLQ-H\&N35 (V1.0) ., 5 years after surgery|Quality of Life as assessed by QLQ-C30, Patients in the experimental group were evaluated for QoL within 1 week before the start of radiotherapy, 1 week after the end of radiotherapy, 3 months after the end of radiotherapy, and 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. The control group patients were evaluated for QoL at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after surgery. The QoL evaluation scale adopts the EORTC Quality of Life Measurement Scale QLQ-C30 (V3.0) Chinese version., 5 years after surgery
