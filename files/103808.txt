Safety and Efficacy of IBI389 Single Agent, and in Combination With Sintilimab, in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of IBI389 as a single agent, and in combination with sintilimab, and (or) chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: IBI 308 injection|DRUG: IBI 389 Injection
Number of subjects with AEs and SAEs, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI389 alone or in combination with Sintilimab \[Adverse events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) \], up to 2 years after enrollment|Percentage of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI389 alone or in combination with Sintilimab., up to 28 Days following first dose
Pharmacokinetics: AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration., up to 2 years after enrollment|Cmax, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of the drug after administration, up to 2 years after enrollment|Immunogenicity: Percentage of ADA positive subjects, Immunogenicity: Number of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) positive subjects will be counted and percentage of ADA positive subjects will be calculated to evaluate immunogenicity of IBI389., up to 2 years after enrollment|Preliminary anti-tumor activity of IBI389 (Objective Response Rate), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors., up to 2 years after enrollment
The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Ia) and a dose expansion phase (Ib). Phase Ia is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for IBI389 as a single agent, and in combination with sintilimab. Phase (Ib) is a multi-cohort trial of CLDN18.2 positive solid tumors to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of IBI389 in combination with sintilimab and (or) chemotherapy or IBI389 monotherapy.
