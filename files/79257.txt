HLA-Mismatched Unrelated Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation With Reduced Dose Post Transplantation Cyclophosphamide GvHD Prophylaxis
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of Reduced Dose Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with hematologic malignancies after receiving an HLA-Mismatched Unrelated Donor (MMUD) . The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Does a reduced dose of PTCy reduce the occurrence of infections in the first 100 days after transplant?
* Does a reduced dose of PTCy maintain the same level of protection against Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) as the standard dose of PTCy?
