This multicenter, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tarceva (erlotinib) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer and an ECOG performance status of 0-1. Eligible participants receiving Tarceva according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and local label will be followed for the duration of their treatment.
Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib 150 mg
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from initial dose of erlotinib to progression or death from any cause., Approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Overall response was defined, based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) v 1.1, as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR). CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of all target lesions., Approximately 3 years|Proportions of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs, and AEs of Special Interest (AESIs), An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.
