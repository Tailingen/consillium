Second-Line Adjuvant Therapy With Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Versus Oxaliplatin Plus Folinic Acid and Fluorouracil for Gemcitabine-Refractory Pancreatic Cancer After Curative Resection
The purpose of this study is to investigate the activity and safety of second-line adjuvant therapy with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) versus oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and fluorouracil (OFF) for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer after curative resection.
Stage ⅠA Pancreatic Cancer|Stage ⅠB Pancreatic Cancer|Stage ⅡA Pancreatic Cancer|Stage ⅡB Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: oxaliplatin|DRUG: folinic acid|DRUG: fluorouracil
Overall survival, To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of second-line adjuvant therapy with AG versus OFF in terms of overall survival for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer after curative resection. Outpatient visit, phone interview, From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause, assessed 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of two regimens in terms of objective response rate. Computed tomography (CT) scan, Complete Remission% + Partial Remission %, assessed 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).|Time to Remission, To evaluate the time to remission of patients treated with the two regimens. Computed tomography (CT) scan, From date of enrollment until the date of remission, assessed 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).|Progression-Free Survival, To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with the two regimens. Computed tomography (CT) scan, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression, assessed 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).|The Levels of Tumor Biomarkers in Serum, To evaluate the levels of tumor biomarkers in serum of patients treated with the two regimens, including Carbohydrate Antigen (CA)19-9、CA125、CA153、CA242、CA72-4、CA50、CEA、AFP . Outpatient visit, laboratory findings, 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).|Number of grade 3 and 4 toxicities according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0, To evaluate the occurrence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; version 4.0) in patients treated with the two regimens. The toxicity profile includes but not limits neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis (acute or chronic, including ketoacidosis), which will be summarized as the percentage of patients by type and grade according to treatment group. Outpatient visit, laboratory findings., 1 week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months.|Quality of life, To evaluate the quality of life score of patients treated with the two regimens. Outpatient visit, phone interview, 2 cycles during the therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months; Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days for AG regimen and 42 days for OFF regimen).
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of second-line adjuvant therapy with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) versus oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and fluorouracil (OFF) in terms of overall survival for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer after curative resection.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of two regimens in terms of objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1
* To evaluate the time to remission of patients treated with the two regimens.
* To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with the two regimens.
* To evaluate the levels of tumor biomarkers in serum of patients treated with the two regimens, including Carbohydrate Antigen (CA)19-9、CA125、CA153、CA242、CA72-4、CA50、CEA、AFP.
* To evaluate the occurrence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 in patients treated with the two regimens.
* To evaluate the quality of life score of patients treated with the two regimens.

Detailed Description of Arms:

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arm AG or Arm OFF). Arm AG: Firstly, patients receive nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m\^2 (iv, 30 minutes) on days 1, 8, and 15 for 3 weeks, followed by one week without treatment. Secondly, patients receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m\^2 (iv, 30 minutes) on days 1, 8, and 15 for 3 weeks, followed by one week without treatment. Treatment repeats until there is disease progression or recurrence.

Arm OFF: Patients receive oxaliplatin 85 mg/m\^2 (iv, 2 hours) on days 8 and 22 with 42 days as a cycle. Patients receive folinic acid 200 mg/m\^2 (iv) and fluorouracil 2000 mg/m\^2 (iv, 24 hours) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without treatment. Oxaliplatin is given before folinic acid and fluorouracil when the three drugs are given on the same days. Treatment repeats until there is disease progression or recurrence.
