A Study of Photon and Proton Chemoradiotherapy As Definitive or Neoadjuvant Therapy in Non-Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This study will observe side effects for patients who receive a 3-week course of radiation and chemotherapy for pancreas cancer. Blood samples will be collected before and after treatment to assess pancreas cancer DNA levels and its impact on outcomes.
