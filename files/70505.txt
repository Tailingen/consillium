DRUG: PNT2258
To determine the safety of PNT2258 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Safety and tolerability of PNT2258 and the determination of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the recommended Phase 2 dose, Ongoing
Pharmacokinetic profile of PNT2258, Ongoing
This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PNT2258 in patients with advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy exists. Patients will receive PNT2258 as an intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days (Days 1-5) of every 21-day cycle (3 weeks). At first, patients will be treated in single patient cohorts following an accelerated titration design and evaluated for toxicities. After the accelerated portion ends, patients will be treated in cohorts of at least 3 patients at each dose level and evaluated for treatment-related toxicities.
