Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Cisplatin in Solid Tumor
The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of cisplatin, 80 mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).
Solid Tumors
DRUG: NGR-hTNF|DRUG: Cisplatin
To verify the safety of escalating doses of NGRhTNF (from 0.2 to 1.6 Âµg/m^2) in combination with cisplatin (80 mg/m^2) every 3 weeks, To recommend a dose regimen of NGR-hTNF + Cisplatin for future phase II trials
To document the preliminary antitumor activity of the combination in terms of objective response rate according to RECIST criteria, every six weeks|To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the combination of NGR-hTNF and cisplatin, During the study|To measure plasma levels of sTNFRs and anti-NGR-hTNF antibodies, During the study
This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned.

Patients, with advanced or metastatic solid tumor not amenable of standard therapy will be enrolled.
