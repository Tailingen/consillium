Fraction Dose Escalation of Split-course Hypofractionated Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Following Induction Chemo-immunotherapy in Unresectable Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma: a Phase I Study.
This Phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated fraction dose (MTD) for split-course hypo-CCRT following induction chemo-immunotherapy in LA-ESCC patients, to clarify the dosimetric advantage of split-course hypo-CCRT, and to investigate the treatment-related toxicities and quality of life of the new regimen.
