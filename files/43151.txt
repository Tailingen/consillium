A Clinical Study of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of BCD-263 and Opdivo® as Monotherapy in Subjects With Advanced Melanoma of the Skin
The aim of the study BCD-263-1 is to prove the comparability of the pharmacokinetics and similarity of the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic profiles of BCD-263 and Opdivo following intravenous administration to subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma of the skin. The study will have randomized, double-blind design with parallel assignment.

Following screening, subjects will be randomized to receive either BCD-263 or Opdivo in a 1:1 ratio and enter the main study period.

During the main study period, subjects will receive therapy with BCD-263 or Opdivo, which will be administered intravenously until disease progression or signs of unacceptable toxicity develop (whichever occurs earlier).

At Week 25, after completion of all scheduled procedures subjects in both groups will continue to receive open-label BCD-263 for up to a total of 2 years of therapy, or disease progression, or signs of unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first).

Following discontinuation of the study therapy, the subjects will enter a follow-up period, during which data on overall survival will be collected through telephone contacts.
