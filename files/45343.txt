Halaven Patient Registry (Metastatic Breast Cancer, MBC)
Since the first marketing authorization in the world in November 2010 granted by US FDA, Halaven has been approved for clinical use in more than 40 countries worldwide, including many Asian countries, e.g. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. According to two large global phase III study reports of Halaven, very few Asian patients participated in these studies. In a phase II study of Halaven with metastatic breast cancer, the clinical efficacy and toxicity were reported only in 80 Japanese patients. Halaven has been granted its marketing authorization in Singapore since February 2011. However, most of other Asian countries including India have had the approval and launched from middle year of 2013 or in early 2014. Limited information of Halaven using in Asian patients are available except several case experience exchange presented by individual medical centers or as personal experience in the past. Some clinical concerns related to Halaven use are raised by clinicians during their clinical practice, such as how Halaven works on Asian patients, which type of patient obtains better clinical benefit from Halaven, and what are the main treatment related toxicities in Asian which may differ from Westerners due to potential ethnic diversity. Further understanding of Halaven related clinical benefit and toxicity in Asian patients through collecting clinical experience among Asian countries becomes necessary and may provide better information to anticipate these concerns.

The proposed "Halaven Patient Registry" (called the "Registry") will be a patient population-based registry to collect therapeutic related information from patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with Halaven that was given as a clinical decision by patient's treating physician based on clinical status of a patient and proper indication of Halaven and to gain a better understanding of the use of Halaven in such Asian patients.
