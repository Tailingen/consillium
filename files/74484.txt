Study to Assess AFM24 in Combination with Atezolizumab in Selected Advanced/Metastatic EGFR-expressing Cancers
AFM24-102 is a Phase 1/2a open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose escalation, and expansion study evaluating AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with selected EGRF-expressing advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.

There will be 2 parts in this study: a dose escalation phase (phase 1) and an expansion phase (phase 2a). Patients will qualify to receive the investigational drugs (AFM24 + atezolizumab) in the dose escalation phase or the expansion phase only if they are deemed eligible following the safety lead-in phase. Seven days before the planned first combination treatment, patients will receive a single dose of AFM24 and will be observed for any adverse events for 1 week.

The aim of the dose escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab.

The dose escalation phase will be followed by the expansion phase once the MTD/RP2D of AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab has been determined. The expansion phase of the study is intended to collect preliminary evidence of efficacy and to further confirm the safety of AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab.

The tumor types planned to be studied in the AFM24/atezolizumab combination study will be:

* Non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR-WT), with disease progression after chemotherapy and PD1/PD-L1 targeted therapy
* Gastric/GEJ cancer if intolerant to or with disease progression after standard platinum-based chemotherapy
* Pancreatic/hepatocellular/biliary tract cancer with disease progression after standard of care (SOC) therapy or if there is no appropriate SOC available for their condition
* Advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring a targetable EGFR kinase domain mutation with disease progression on or after received â‰¥1 prior lines of treatment for advanced disease, including a Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR mutations
