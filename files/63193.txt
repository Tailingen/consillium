A Clinical Study of Zilovertamab Vedotin (MK-2140) Plus Rituximab Plus Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, and Prednisone (R-CHP) Versus Polatuzumab Vedotin Plus R-CHP in People With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) (MK-2140-011/waveLINE-011)
Researchers are looking for ways to treat germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL). DLBCL is a fast-growing blood cancer that affects B-cells. GCB is a type of DLBCL that affects young B-cells that are still maturing.

The goal of this study is to learn if more people who receive zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140) and R-CHP have the cancer respond (go away) than those who receive polatuzumab vedotin and R-CHP.

Complete Response Rate (CRR) at End of Treatment (EOT) per Lugano Response Criteria, CRR at EOT is defined as the percentage of participants who experience complete response (CR) per Lugano response criteria as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) at end of treatment. CR is complete metabolic (no/minimal FDG uptake) and radiologic response (target lesions regress to â‰¤1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter of a lesion) and no new lesions. Participants with missing data or who discontinue treatment or study prior to reaching EOT will be considered non-responders and included in the total number of participants., Up to approximately 31 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Lugano Response Criteria, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per Lugano response criteria by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 51 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 87 months|Event-free Survival (EFS) per Lugano Response Criteria, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progressive disease per Lugano response criteria by BICR, death due to any cause, initiation of a new anti-caner therapy, or a positive biopsy for residual disease. The EFS for all participants will be presented., Up to approximately 51 months|Duration of CR, For participants who demonstrate CR at EOT per Lugano response criteria by BICR, duration of complete response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR at or before EOT until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 51 months|Number of participants who experience one or more adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 9 months|Number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 6 months|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality Of Life (HRQoL) on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) Trial Outcome Index (TOI), The FACT-Lym is a 42-item questionnaire designed to measure HRQoL and cancer-specific symptoms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Subscales include FACT-General (FACT-G), FACT-Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI), FACT-Lym total score (FACT-Lym TS), and the Lymphoma subscale (Lym S). The Lym S has a single domain consisting of 15 items specific to lymphoma burden with a score ranging from 0 to 60. FACT-G has 4 well-being domains, physical (7 items), social/family (7), emotional (6), and functional (7), with scores ranging from 0 to 108. FACT-TOI combines FACT-G's physical and functional domains with Lym S, with scores ranging from 0 to 116. FACT-Lym TS combines FACT-G with Lym S, with scores ranging from 0 to 168. The scoring of FACT-Lym is on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4, with 0= not at all, 1= a little bit, 2= somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. The higher the score the better the quality of life., Baseline and up to Week 25|Change From Baseline in HRQoL on FACT-Lym Total Score, The FACT-Lym is a 42-item questionnaire designed to measure HRQoL and cancer-specific symptoms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Subscales include FACT-General (FACT-G), FACT-Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI), FACT-Lym total score (FACT-Lym TS), and the Lymphoma subscale (Lym S).

The higher the score the better the quality of life., Baseline and up to Week 25|Change From Baseline in HRQoL on FACT-Lym Physical Well-being (PWB) (Items General Physical [GP]1 through GP7), The FACT-Lym is a 42-item questionnaire designed to measure HRQoL and cancer-specific symptoms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Subscales include FACT-General (FACT-G), FACT-Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI), FACT-Lym total score (FACT-Lym TS), and the Lymphoma subscale (Lym S).

It is an 11-item questionnaire designed to measure the neurotoxicity subscale. The scoring of FACT/GOG-NTX is on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4, with 0= not at all, 1= a little bit, 2= somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. To produce a Neurotoxicity Subscale score (range 0-44), the sum of the item scores are multiplied by the number of items in the subscale, then divided by the number of items answered., Baseline and up to Week 25
