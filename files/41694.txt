A Study of CAR T-Cells in Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancy
This study is a single-center, open-label clinical trial of single-dose of CAR T-cells in subjects with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy.
Relapsed/refractory Lymphoma|Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19-CAR T-cells, or anti-CD30-CAR T-cells, or anti-CD20/CD30-CAR T-cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Evaluate safety and tolerability of CAR T-cells, Proportion of subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), 28 days after infusion of CAR T-cells|Evaluate the feasibility of administration of CAR T-cells, The proportion of subjects for whom the desired dose of CAR T-cells can be successfully manufactured, 12 months
Adverse events, Will be assessed using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0. AEs will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity, time of onset, duration, probable association with the study treatment and reversibility or outcome., 12 months|Incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, Will be assessed using ASTCT Criteria., 12 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of CAR T-cells, Test Copy number of CAR in peripheral blood, 28 days after CAR T infusion, after which the evaluation is at the discretion of investigator|Preliminary anti-tumor effect, Efficacy evaluation will be based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines version 1. 2022 (ALL), or Lugano criteria (Lymphoma), 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) defined as proportion of subjects achieving partial response or better, 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival（PFS） defined as the time from the date of CAR T infusion to the first assessment of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 1 year after CAR-T infusion|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival defined as the time from the date of CAR T infusion of the subject to death due to any cause, Up to 15 years after CAR-T infusion|Evaluate host immunogenicity to CAR T-cells, Incidence of anti-scFv antibodies, 12 months|Evaluate toxicology of CAR T-cells, Levels of cytokines in serum, including IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 28 days after CAR T infusion, after which the evaluation is at the discretion of investigator
The study will enroll subjects with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy, including lymphoma and leukemia. Subjects will receive a single infusion of CAR T-cells after screening, PBMC collection, and lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Toxicity will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0) from the National Cancer Institute. Safety of CAR T-cell therapy will be evaluated through laboratory tests, including 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital sign checks, and physical examination etc. Additionally, blood samples will be collected to study cellular pharmacokinetics and explore the effects of cell therapy on ferritin, C-reactive protein, and relevant cytokines.
