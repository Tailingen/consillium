BMT-06: Study of Intensity Modulated Total Marrow Irradiation (IM-TMI)
Pre-transplant conditioning will include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 6Gy. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis will include cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on Day +3 and 4 along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil

This is a single arm phase II clinical trial. Patients will receive a standard conditioning regimen with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Flu/Cy/TBI) prior to haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition the pre-transplant conditioning will include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 6Gy. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis will include cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on Day +3 and 4 along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.
