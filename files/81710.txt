To Study the Feasibility and Quality of Life of Medial Group Retropharyngeal Node Sparing in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is an randomized, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether medial group retropharyngeal node （MRLN） sparing could reduce the incidence of radiation-caused dysphagia and improve patients' quality of life without compromising survival rate.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: medial group retropharyngeal node（MRLN） sparing
Local replase-free survival rate, Local failure-free survival is calculated from randomization to the first local failure, 3 Year
Incidence of acute and late toxicity, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1 year|Incidence of out-field recurrence rate, Number of participants with out-field recurrence, 3 Year|Dysphagia related quality of life, Quality of life (QOL) as assessed by EORTC quality of life questionnaire(QLQ)-HN35, 1 year|Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause, 3 Year
In this study, patients with non-keratinizing stage T1-4 N0-3 M0 NPC(UICC/AJCC 8th edition), except for patients with MRLN metastasis, are randomly assigned to receive MRLN sparing or prophylactic irradiation . Patients in MRLN sparing group will not routinely receive MRLN irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr; while patients in MRLN prophylactic irradiation group will always receive MRLN irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr. Our primary endpoint is local relapse-free survival (LRFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), incidence of out-field recurrence rate, toxic effects, and quality of life (QOL).All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
