Ibrutinib and Lenalidomide With Dose Adjusted EPOCH-R in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

OS will be measured from the time of first study drug administration until the date of death using Kaplan-Meier methodology., From initial dose date until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 1 year after the last subject received the first dose, up to 36 months at the most.|Duration of Response (DOR), Part 2: DOR will be measured from the time by which the measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until the first date by which recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., From initial response date until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 1 year after the last subject received the first dose.
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized multicenter study conducted in 2 parts. Part 1, will determine the MTD of the combination of ibrutinib, lenalidomide and DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with DLBCL.

Ibrutinib will be administered at a fixed dose of 560 mg and lenalidomide will be dose-escalated. DA-EPOCH-R will be given at standard doses.

For Part 2, the MTD determined in Part 1 will be the dose used for all subjects. If no MTD is identified, then subjects in Part 2 will be treated with the maximum administered doses (MAD, treatment doses from dose Level 4).

The primary objective for Part 2 is to determine the ORR of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R in subjects with ABC DLBCL as analyzed by gene expression profiling when treated at recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
