Pilot Breast-Dedicated PET Camera With 1 Millimeter Spatial Resolution
This is a research study of a novel, "breast-dedicated" positron emission tomography (PET) camera with 1 millimeter spatial resolution. The main goal of the study is for the personnel to understand practical and logistical issues with using the camera in the clinic
Breast Cancer
DRUG: 18F-FDG|DEVICE: Breast-dedicated PET camera
Image quality with the breast-dedicated PET camera, Feasibility of the pilot breast-dedicated PET camera will be assessed on the basis of whether acceptable images are obtained. Images will be assessed and graded as 1 of 3 quality ratings: excellent, good, and poor. The outcome will be reported as the number of images that are excellent, good, and poor, a number without dispersion., 1 day
Primary Objective To obtain initial experience using the novel, breast-dedicated PET camera design in the breast imaging clinic.

Secondary Objectives To understand, given the 10-fold higher sensitivity of this novel camera, how low we can go with administered tracer dose, and, given the \>100-fold better volumetric spatial resolution, understand the achievable image quality.
