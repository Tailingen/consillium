Comparison of Stationary Breast Tomosynthesis and 2-D Digital Mammography in Patients With Known Breast Lesions
The goal of the study is to compare the radiologist confidence level in evaluating patients with known breast lesions using a carbon nanotube x-ray based stationary breast tomosynthesis imaging device. The comparison will be made against conventional mammography acquired as a part of a standard clinical workup. One hundred patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy will be recruited for the study. A reader study will be performed to evaluate the ROC characteristics of the system.
Breast Neoplasms
DEVICE: Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Scanner
Receiver Operative Curve (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) (percentage), Receiver Operative Curve (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis of the stationary breast tomosynthesis (SDBT) system for the the characterization of suspicious breast lesions in comparison to x-ray mammography., approximately 18 months
Reader preference - arbitrary units, To evaluate radiologists confidence in evaluating specific lesion characteristics in suspicious breast lesions. Readers will be scored from -3 to +3., approximately 18 months
