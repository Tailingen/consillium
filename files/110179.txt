Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) for Selected Patients With Early Breast Cancer
This study investigates the feasibility and safety of delivering radiation therapy only to part of the breast, (the tumor bed and selected areas) rather than the whole breast, for patients with early stage breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
RADIATION: Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI)
Feasibility of PBI Directed External Radiotherapy as Measured by Percentage of Participants Achieving a Dosimetrically Satisfactory Treatment Plan, -The study will be deemed infeasible if more than 4 patients cannot be given treatment because her tumor is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan cannot be devised for her., Within 1 year of protocol registration|Feasibility of PBI Directed External Radiotherapy as Measured by Development of Histological Fat Necrosis or Other Grade 4 Skin or Grade 4 Subcutaneous Toxicity, or Requires Surgery for the Skin/Subcutaneous Toxicity, -The study will be deemed infeasible if more than 4 patients develop histological fat necrosis or other grade 4 skin or grade 4 subcutaneous toxicity, or requires surgery for her skin or subcutaneous toxicity, Within 1 year of protocol registration
Incidence and Severity of Cutaneous Toxicity, * Uses RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme
* Grade 0 = none
* Grade 1 = slight atrophy; pigmentation change; some hair loss
* Grade 2 = patch atrophy; moderate telangiectasia; total hair loss
* Grade 3 = marked atrophy; gross telangiectasia
* Grade 4 = ulceration
* Worst cutaneous toxicity grade is noted, Up to 5 years|Incidence of Breast Fibrosis, Up to 5 years|Incidence of Fat Necrosis, -Fat necrosis typically causes a painless mass located superficially in the breast, accompanied by retraction or dimpling of the overlying skin. The skin may be thickened clinically and radiologically. Fat necrosis is firm and relatively circumscribed on palpation. Mammography usually reveals a spiculated, often poorly defined mass that may contain punctate or large, irregular calcifications. Attachment to the skin, dimpling, and thickening of the skin are often evident. Less frequently, the lesion consists of a circumscribed, oil-filled, partly calcified cyst. Early in its development, fat necrosis has the appearance of hemorrhage in indurated fat. After several weeks, the affected area becomes demarcated, forming a distinct yellow-gray and focally reddish tumor. Cystic degeneration may develop in the center of such a lesion, resulting in a cavity that contains oily fluid or necrotic fat., Up to 5 years|Cosmetic Outcome, * Excellent: little or no observable change
* Good: minimal but identifiable changes
* Fair: significant results of radiotherapy noted
* Poor: severe normal tissue sequelae, Up to 5 years|Local Control Rate, -Local control rate for this study is the number of participants who remained free of disease in their breast., Up to 5 years|Regional Control Rate, -Regional control rate for this study is the number of participants who remained free from disease in the regional lymph nodes. The regional lymph nodes are the axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and internal mammary lymph node beds, Up to 5 years|Distant Control Rate, -Distant control rate for this study is the number of participants who remained free of cancer at distant sites which is defined as all parts of the body that are not the ipsilateral breast or ipsilateral regional lymph nodes., Up to 5 years
