Apatinib Combined With S-1 as Maintenance Therapy for HER-2 Negatived Gastric Cancer
Apatinib is a novel drug which was produced by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co.Ltd in China. It is approved in advanced gastric cancer（GC）. The investigators just want to design such kind of trail to prove its effect when combined with S-1 as maintenance in advanced HER-2 negatived GC treated with 4 cycles chemotherapy and valued as SD. Investigators will evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
HER-2 Negatived Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib and S-1
progression-free survival, From date of registration until the date of disease progresssion or death resulting from any cause., Patients will be followed for an average period of 1 year
overall survival, From date of registration until the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up visit., Patients will be followed for an average period of 1 year
1-year survival rate, Percentage of patients alive at 1 year., 12 months|Safety and tolerability as measured by number and grade of toxicity events, Overall Safety Profile by CTCAE V4.1, 12 months
GC is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Most patients are diagnosed with unresectable advanced or metastatic stage disease losing the radical surgery opportunity. Till now there is no novel targeted drug which can increase the OS for advanced GC patients except HER-2 positive patients.

Approximate 30 patients with unresectable GC treated with 4 cycles chemotherapy and valued as stable disease will be enrolled in this study,The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and security of apatinib and S-1 as maintenance therapy.
