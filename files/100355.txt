Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant for Children With Myeloid Hematological Malignancies
In this study, the investigators will use busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy) backbone with the addition of fludarabine as the preparative Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) regimen. As an attempt to improve engraftment rate and reduce infections, the investigators are going to incorporate fludarabine in the conditioning regimen. The use of a BuCy backbone has been widely used and comparable to total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (Cy/TBI) regimen.

Encouraging data on adding fludarabine to the SCT regimen have been reported. A fludarabine-based, conditioning regimen, with adequate immunosuppressive activity could conceivably allow engraftment of stem cells from alternative donors in hematologic malignancies patients with acceptable engraftment rates and low transplant-related mortality. Regimen-related toxicity is believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD. Therefore this approach may also lead to reduced GVHD, as some investigators have suggested.

In an attempt to decrease the rate of viral infection and reactivation, the investigators will avoid ATG (Thymoglobulin) / Campath (anti-CD52), and instead administer Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). The addition of fludarabine should compensate any increase risk of graft failure with the removal of the ATG/Campath. The investigators anticipate that the removal of ATG/Campath will facilitate immune reconstitution more efficiently after receiving a UCBT.

The following will be given as the conditioning regimen for the transplant:

BUSULFAN: Busulfan (intravenous BUSULFEX) dosing will be as follows: patients \<12 kg: 1.1 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 16 doses total; patients \>12 kg: 0.8 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 16 doses. Administration and pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed as per standard practice. Anticonvulsants will be given in accordance with standard Blood and Marrow Transplant Program recommendations.

CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE: Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/dose) will be given IV on Days -5, - 4, -3, and -2 over 1 hour. The total dose to be given over 4 days is 200 mg/kg. Mesna will be given in accordance with standard Blood and Marrow Transplant.

FLUDARABINE: Fludarabine will be given IV daily over 1 hour for 3 days. Dosing will be as follows: for patients â‰¤ 10 kg: 1.3 mg/kg; for patients \> 10 kg: 40 mg/m2. Preparation, administration and monitoring will be according to standard practice procedure

POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:

* CSA will begin on Day -3. For children \< 40 kg, the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 2 hours every 12 hours. Dose adjustments will be made to maintain levels above 200 ng/mL. Levels will be done on Day 0 and then as clinical indicated. CSA will be tapered per institutional SOP. Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has a normal gastrointestinal transit time, CSA will be converted to an oral form.
* MMF will begin on Day 0 at a dose of 15 mg/Kg IV or orally TID, and will be discontinued on Day +45 unless GVHD is present.

CNS Disease: Patients with CNS relapse or primary CNS disease that is symptomatic or associated to radiological changes will receive additional irradiation to the craniospinal axis.

SUPPORTIVE CARE:

* Supportive care will be provided as per standard practice of the Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant program at the Texas Children's Hospital, including all prophylactic and therapeutic clinical care issues. These practices may be modified if necessary for any individual patient in order to provide optimum care for that particular patient.
* IVIG: Intravenous immunoglobulin (500 mg/kg per dose) will be given monthly until discontinuation of GVHD therapy and documentation of antibody production.
* CB-CTLs: Patients enrolled in this protocol may also be eligible for infusion of CB-derived multivirus-specific CTL to provide virus-specific immune reconstitution and treatment of viral infections after CBT.
