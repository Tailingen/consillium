DFS, Disease free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented recurrence, metastasis or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
OS, Overall Survival, From randomization to death of any cause,assessed up to 60 months|LRFS, Local recurrence free survival, From randomization to local recurrence or death,assessed up to 24 months|DMFS, Distant metastasis free survival, From randomization to distant metastasis or death, assessed up to 24 months|1-and 2-year DFS rate, one- and two-year disease free survival, end of 1st year, end of 2nd year|1-and 2-year OS rate, one- and two-year overall survival rate, end of 1st year, end of 2nd year
This study is an open-label, multicentered, evaluator-blinded , randomized clinical trial.

Patients with early-stage recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma were randomized into the control group and the experimental group. Patients in the control group would go through observation and follow-up after recurrent endoscopic surgery, while patients in the experimental group would be treated with adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A total of 176 subjects are required, with 88 patients in the control group and 88 patients in the experimental group.
