Exploratory, Phase I,Open Label,Non-randomized Study of [F18]CP-18 PET in Normal and Breast Cancer Subjects
This trial will be the first trial for the IP, \[F-18\]CP-18, and will be conducted as an exploratory Phase I trial designed to collect information as this IP is administered and evaluated for the first time in humans. The trial will evaluate safety, biodistribution and dosimetry data in normal subjects and the trial will evaluate safety, biodistribution and tumor to background imaging data, and correlate image data with caspase 3 activity level on a surgical specimen analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the cancer subjects. All study results will be evaluated and analyzed in order to consider the design for future clinical trials. The information collected under this exploratory, Phase I study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management of the subject.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: [F18]CP-18 Injection
To collect biodistribution, dosimetry and metabolite profile of [F-18]CP-18 from normal subjects, Visit 2 and Visit 3
To collect pre-dose and post-dose parameters of vital signs, ECG and CBC and clinical chemistry data along with monitoring any adverse events of the IP from normal and cancer subjects., Visit 2 and Visit 3
The Sponsor intends to conduct this exploratory investigation of \[F-18\]CP-18 in human subjects. In this study of \[F-18\]CP-18, it is intended to assess its biodistribution, PET scan resolution, signal to background ratio in tumor, and any adverse events. This exploratory Phase I study will be used to obtain the necessary safety and dosimetry data in normal subjects and to collect drug biodistribution data, and tumor to background imaging data in breast cancer subjects. The information collected from this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management of the subject.
