DN-101 in Combination With Docetaxel in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer (AIPC) (AIPC Study of Calcitriol Enhancing Taxotere [ASCENT-2])
The primary objective of this study is:

* To evaluate the effect of DN-101 in combination with docetaxel (ASCENT regimen) on survival in metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* To determine the effect of the ASCENT regimen on the rate of thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* To determine the effect of the ASCENT regimen on prevention of skeletal-related events (fractures)
* A Separate sub-study will be conducted at selected study sites in North America to determine the population PK of DN-101.
