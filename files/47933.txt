Discovering Novel Cancer Treatment Options Using a Comprehensive NGS-based Liquid Molecular Testing Panel in the Community Setting ("DINOSAur II")
To prospectively identify cancer patients whose tumors express specific molecular markers targeted by therapeutic agents from a comprehensive l i q u i d molecular test, for the purpose of selecting the most clinically appropriate treatment in a pragmatic two arm trial.
Stage III Solid Tumors|Stage IV Solid Tumors
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Comprehensive liquid molecular panel test|OTHER: EORTC QLQ-30
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30), The EORTC Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) includes six clearly distinguishable functioning scales that have been thoroughly tested and validated on an international level and that are available in 110 different language versions. The scaling of items is 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much), 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent). The higher the score the better the quality of life., 2 years
