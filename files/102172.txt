Amivantamab, Lazertinib, and Pemetrexed for First-line Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancers With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations
This is a phase II, single-arm, multicenter trial, conducted through Latin American Coorperative Oncology Group (LACOG). Treatment-naïve patients with recurrent/metastatic NSCLCs harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R point mutations will be enrolled. At baseline, an archival or (optional) new tissue sample will be obtained for biomarker evaluation, as well as liquid biopsies. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancers
DRUG: Amivantamab|DRUG: Lazertinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed 500 mg
To evaluate the 18-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate, To evaluate the 18-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of amivantamab, lazertinib, carboplatin and pemetrexed for first-line treatment of recurrent / metastatic non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with EGFR mutations., 18 months
Overall progression-free survival, 18 months|Overall response rate, Defined as the proportion of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., 18 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of participant's death due to any cause., 18 months|Progression-free survival After First Subsequent Therapy (PFS 2), The PFS 2 is defined as the time from enrollment until the date of second objective disease progression, after initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, based on investigator assessment (after that used for PFS) or death, whichever comes first., 18 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and toxicity assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety includes adverse events in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events (AE). The rate of any grade of adverse events as well as the rate of adverse events grade ≥3 according to the CTCAE version 5 will be evaluated. Adverse events of special interest of Amivantamab and Lazertinib will be based on the definitions given in the protocol of each one., 18 months|Performance status at progression-free survival 1 and progression-free survival 2, 18 months|Compliance, Includes number of patients whose treatment had to be reduced, delayed, or permanently discontinued, grouped by reason. The reason for termination includes aspects of efficacy (e.g. termination due to tumor progression), safety (e.g. termination due to adverse events) and compliance (e.g. termination due to patient's withdrawal of consent)., 18 months|Post-progression therapies, Description of therapies after disease progression., 18 months|Patient reported outcomes, Defined as the change from baseline of disease-related symptoms and quality of life based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core cancer instrument and supplemental lung cancer module., 18 months|Intracranial Progression-Free Survival, Intracranial PFS is defined as the time from enrollment until the date of objective intracranial disease progression or death, whichever comes first, using RECIST v1.1., 18 months
This study aims to test the hypothesis that delivery of maximum therapy consisting of lazertinib plus amivantamab plus chemotherapy as frontline treatment in patients with recurrent/metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 or exon 21 mutations will be feasible, safe, and will improve PFS compared to historical controls. If successful, this study may allow for the estimation of efficacy and toxicity of a three drug regimen of amivantamab, lazertinib, and pemetrexed and may support further evaluation of maximum therapy against osimertinib single agent, lazertinib single agent, osimertinib plus chemotherapy, and/or lazertinib plus amivantamab.
