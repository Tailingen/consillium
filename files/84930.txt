Quantitative MRI in Assessing Disease in Patients With Brain Tumors
This pilot clinical trial studies quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla in assessing disease in patients with tumors that have spread to the brain (brain metastases). In addition to routine care brain imaging of the brain, this study will include advanced multiparametric MRI sequences to measure vascular, cellular, and molecular properties of the tumor. Performing extra scans during MRI provides more information about the metastases and may better predict treatment response.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To correlate pre-treatment measures of biophysical parameters in metastases-obtained using advanced, quantitative MRI techniques in patients receiving standard-of-care (SOC) therapy for 1-4 brain metastases-with treatment-induced changes in lesion size, time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo hybrid 3 Tesla MRI examination that includes standard MRI sequences, diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), and combined dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI/dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI at baseline.
