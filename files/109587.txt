Number and Severity of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Following Treatment With Escalating Doses of HPN424, Assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of HPN424 in successive cohorts of patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study was terminated early, therefore the primary goal of the final data analysis was to look at dosing schedule rather than individual dose levels. The results displayed are shown broken out by dosing schedules and no analysis of specific dose levels was performed. This analysis is as outlined in the final Statistical Analysis Plan., 21 days
