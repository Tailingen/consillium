HEM-iSMART-A: Decitabine / Venetoclax and Navitoclax in Pediatric Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hematological Malignancies
HEM-iSMART is a master protocol which investigates multiple investigational medicinal products in children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) ALL and LBL. Sub-protocol A is a phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Decitabine / Venetoclax and Navitoclax in children and AYA with R/R pediatric ALL/LBL
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, in Relapse|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (Precursor B-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia) Recurrent|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (Precursor T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia) Recurrent|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (Precursor B-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia) Refractory|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (Precursor T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia) Refractory
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Navitoclax|DRUG: intrathecal chemotherapy
Phase I: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Defined as the highest dose level tested at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during course 1 with at least 2 patients experiencing DLT at the next higher dose., 3 years|Phase II: Best overall response rate (ORR), For patients with leukemia: CR and MRD response after 1 cycle of treatment. This includes determination of CR, CRp, CRi and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate in patients suffering from overt morphological relapse of T-ALL at time of enrolment (morphological disease (M2/M3)), and the MRD negativity rate in those that entered with high-MRD levels but in morphological CR. These results will together be presented as a composite endpoint Overall Response rate (ORR). MRD negativity will be defined as â‰¤1x10-4 as generated by multi-parameter flow cytometry.

For patients with lymphoma: Response in LBL patients is defined as CR, PR, minor response (MR) as defined in International pediatric NHL response criteria. In case of bone-marrow involvement MRD will be taken into account., 6 years
Overall survival (OS), Defined as time from C1D1 until death of any cause., 7 years|Event-free survival (EFS), Defined as time from C1D1 to the first event (subsequent relapse after CR (including molecular reappearance), death of any cause, failure to achieve remission (CR, CRp or CRi), or secondary malignancy)., 7 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), Estimate of the risk, that a patient will develop a relapse over a specified period of time., 7 years|Number of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after the experimental therapy., The rate of those proceeding to subsequent allogenic HSCT, 7 years|Cumulative overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the CR, CRp, CRi and MRD negativity rates after more than 1 cycle of treatment, 7 years|Rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 7 years|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Estimation of decitabine, venetoclax and navitoclax Cmax, 6 years
HEM-iSMART is a master protocol with sub-protocols. The overarching objective is that introducing targeted therapy using a biomarker driven approach for treatment stratification may improve the outcome of children with R/R acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) It is characterized by a shared framework that allows for the investigation of multiple IMPs and generate pivotal safety and efficacy evidence within the sub-protocols to establish and define the benefits and risks of new treatments for children with R/R leukemia.

Sub-protocol A within HEM-iSMART, is a phase I/II, multicenter, international, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of decitabine, venetoclax and navitoclax in children, adolescents and young with R/R ALL and LBL. The epigenetic approach may improve outcome for patients whose tumor lack molecular alterations.
