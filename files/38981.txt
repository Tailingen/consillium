A Pharmacodynamic Study of AV-299 (Formerly SCH 900105) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Who Have Liver Metastases
A pharmacodynamic study to evaluate the effect of AV-299 on exploratory pharmacodynamic markers in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have liver metastases.

To evaluate safety and tolerability of AV-299 administered IV in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have liver metastases.
