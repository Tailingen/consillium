PTCy and Ruxolitinib vs PTCy, Tacrolimus and MMF in MUD and Haploidentical HSCT
This is multicenter investigator-initiated randomized open-label phase II clinical trial to compare prophylaxis of graft versus host disease treated with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil versus ruxolitinib after post-transplant cyclophosphamide.

In total 128 patients will be included in the study. After inclusion into the study and performing of transplantation patients will be randomized in 1:1 proportion in two arms (64 patients per arm): arm A will include patients who will be treated with cyclophosphamide and ruxolitinib for GVHD prophylaxis; arm B will include patients who will be treated with cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. After the end of the treatment patients will be followed-up during two years.
