Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes MDA-TIL in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, or Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
This phase II trial studies how well autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL works in treating patients with ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL, made by collecting and growing specialized white blood cells (called T-cells) from a patient's tumor, may help to stimulate the immune system in different ways to stop tumor cells from growing.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants With Ovarian Cancer (OVCA), PDAC (Pancreatic Cancer), and Colorectal Cancers (CRC) According to RECIST v1.1 in Subjects With Ovarian Cancer (OVCA), PDAC (Pancreatic Cancer), and Colorectal Cancers (CRC), The ORR is derived as the sum of the number of patients with a confirmed CR or partial response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the All-Treated analysis set x 100%., Through 4 years
Number of Participants With Stable Disease, Participants will be evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks for response., 6 weeks, 12 weeks|Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS), 44.8 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate efficacy using objective response rate (ORR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in subjects with ovarian cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and colorectal cancers.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) within and across cohorts. II. Determine the duration of response (DOR). III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). IV. Further characterize the safety profile of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) across multiple tumor types.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Establish duration of TIL persistence. II. Compare the molecular and immunological features of tumors before and after TIL therapy.

III. Prospectively evaluate the existing immunotherapy response criteria (immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[irRECIST\]) as the best response assessment tool for TIL therapy among a diverse group of solid tumors.

IV. Investigate TIL attributes (CD8 %, CD27 and CD28 expression) and correlation with response to therapy.

V. Assess tumor marker (CA19-9; CA-125) response in patients who produce this tumor marker.

VI. Assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

OUTLINE:

LYMPHODEPLETION REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6, and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL IV over 45 minutes on day 0. Patients then receive IL-2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 18, at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.
