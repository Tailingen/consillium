Study Comparing Lymphoseek® vs. Albumin Nanocolloid in Head and Neck, Melanoma and Breast Cancer
Comparison of the concordance of albumin nanocolloid and Lymphoseek® in the detection of lymph nodes of primary and secondary stage drainage by performing two lymphogammagrams
Head Cancer|Neck Cancer|Melanoma|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lymphoseek|DRUG: Nanocoll
Nodal Concordance: proportion of lymph nodes identified by 99mTc-tilmanocept vs nanocolloidal human serum albumin by lymphoscintigraphies, number and diameter in millimeters of nodes affected identified by 99mTc-tilmanocept vs nanocolloidal, for at least 48 consecutive hours
Time frame to ascertain the sentinel nodes, 1 week|Concordance among early and delayed images obtained withLymphoseek® or with albumianocolloid and the SPECT/CT images., 1 week|Number of sentinel nodes and secondary nodes depicted, 1 week|Tracer retention in injection site, 1 week|Safety and tolerability of 99mTctilmanocept (Lymphoseek®), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by Lymphoseek® or with albuminanocolloid, 1 week
