A Phase 1 Study of AJ1-11095 in Patients With Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (PPV-MF), or Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (PET-MF) Who Have Been Failed by a Type I JAK2 Inhibitor (JAK2i)
AJX-101 is a first-in-human (FIH), phase 1, non-randomized, multi-center, open-label clinical trial designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), clinical activity and changes in biomarkers of an orally administered type II JAK2 inhibitor, AJ1-11095, in subjects with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated with at least one type I JAK2 inhibitor.

Number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v 5.0., Treatment Emergent AEs will be assessed during routine study visits and compared to Baseline to continuously evaluate safety and tolerability of AJ1-11095., Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Protocol-defined potential DLTs will be assessed by the Safety Review Committee at routine intervals., Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AJ1-11095, Safety evaluations will occur consistently for each patient and across patients to assess MTD or RP2D. See description of safety evaluations described in outcomes 1 and 2 mentioned above., Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year
To assess clinical response to AJ1-11095 evaluated by the Total Symptom Score (TSS)., Number and proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥50% from Baseline in Total TSS as well as time to TSS response and duration of TSS response using the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) v4.0. The TSS is a 7 question assessment form with lower scores indicating better outcomes., Baseline through Week 24|To assess clinical response to AJ1-11095 evaluated by spleen volume assessments., Spleen volume reduction (SVR) of ≥35% from Baseline measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)., Baseline through Week 24|To assess clinical response to AJ1-11095 evaluated by spleen length assessments., Proportion of subjects with ≥50% reduction in length of spleen assessed by palpation., Baseline through Week 24|To assess clinical response to AJ1-11095 evaluated through spleen size improvement., Time to spleen size improvement response measured by patient and across all patients., Baseline through Week 24|To evaluate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of AJ1-11095, AUC time curve from 0 to 24 hrs post dose and percent difference between intervals will be evaluated., Pre dose and post dose Cycle 1 (Day 1, and Day 2 (24hrs post), Day 8, 15, 22, and Cycle 2 (Day 1 and 24 hrs post).|To evaluate the Cmax of AJ1-11095, The maximum observed plasma concentration will be evaluated., Pre dose and post dose Cycle 1 (Day 1, and Day 2 (24hrs post), Day 8, 15, 22, and Cycle 2 (Day 1 and 24 hrs post).|To evaluate the Tmax of AJ1-11095, The duration of time taken to reach Cmax will be evaluated., Pre dose and post dose Cycle 1 (Day 1, and Day 2 (24hrs post), Day 8, 15, 22, and Cycle 2 (Day 1 and 24 hrs post).|To evaluate the half-life of AJ1-11095, The depletion of AJ1-00195 in the body will be observed over time., Pre dose and post dose Cycle 1 (Day 1, and Day 2 (24hrs post), Day 8, 15, 22, and Cycle 2 (Day 1 and 24 hrs post).
This is a phase 1, non-randomized, open-label study utilizing a 3+3 sequential dose escalation design followed by an expansion phase. The primary objective will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AJ1-11095, and establish a Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or inform the establishment of a candidate Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D may be the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or may be a dose below the MTD. The candidate RP2D will be based on AE pattern, PK and biomarker information, in addition to all available safety and efficacy data. Expansion cohorts will be enrolled to gather additional safety and efficacy information and to further refine input for future RP2D discussions. Eligible participants will have PMF, PPV-MF or PET-MF and will have either have relapsed after a response, or be refractory to, at least one prior type I JAK2 inhibitor therapy, either administered as monotherapy or in combination with another drug.
