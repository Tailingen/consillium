Hypofractionation With Simultaneous Integrated Boost vs. Standard Fractionation in Early Breast Cancer
Hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible.

Investigators initiated this multicenter two-armed phase III prospective trial to analyse the non-inferiority of hypofractionation with simultaneous integrated boost in patients with early breast cancer in comparison to standard fractionation.

Progression free survival, any local or regional recurrence or distant metastasis or death, 3 to 6 years
Time to occurence of local recurrence, ipsilateral in-breast recurrence, 3 to 6 years|Overall survival, death, 3 to 6 years|Safety and side effects (Number of Patients with Adverse Events), Number of Patients with Adverse Events, 3 to 6 years|Acute and chronic toxicity (NCI-CTCAE), All dimensions of NCI-CTCAE, 1 day, 7 days, end of radiation (last day of radiation and closing visite), 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months, 42 months, 48 months, 54 months, 60 months, 66 months, 72 months|Cosmetic results (NCI-CTCAE), NCI-CTCAE, 1 day, end of radiation (last day of radiation and closing visite), 3 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, 72 months
Control Arm:

Conventionaly fractionated radiotherapy of the breast 28 × 1.8 Gy = 50.4 Gy followed by a tumor bed boost sequentially 5 to 8 × 2.0 Gy = 10.0 Gy to 16.0 Gy, total dose 60.4 Gy to 66.4 Gy.

or Conventionaly fractionated radiotherapy of the breast 28 × 1.8 Gy = 50.4 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost to the tumor bed, total dose 28 × 0.3 Gy or 0.45 Gy= 8.4 Gy or 12,6 Gy, total dose 58,8 Gy to 63.0 Gy.

or Hypofractionated radiotherapy of the breast 16 × 2.66 Gy = 42.56 Gy followed by a tumor bed boost sequentially 5 to 8 × 2.0 Gy = 10.0 Gy to 16.0 Gy, total dose 52.56 Gy to 58.56 Gy.

Experimental Arm:

Hypofractionated radiotherapy of the breast 16 × 2.50 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost to the tumor bed, total dose within the boost volume 16 × 3.00 Gy.
