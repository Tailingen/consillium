Study of Relationship Between UGT1A1 Gene Polymorphism and Toxicity and Efficacy of Irinotecan in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the correlation between uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1(UGT1A1) gene polymorphisms and the side effect and efficacy of irinotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Carcinoma of Lung
DRUG: Irinotecan
Side effect of chemotherapy, myelosuppression,diarrhea, within the first 30 days (plus or minus 3 days) after chemotherapy
response rate of chemotherapy, tumor assessments after two cycles of chemotherapy,an expected average of 6 weeks
In multiple studies of metastatic colorectal cancer,uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1(UGT1A1) gene polymorphisms and its correlation with irinotecan-associated side effects have been confirmed.Data from several studies indicated an improved clinical outcome of patients who had received an irinotecan-based regimen.In order to find out the correlation between UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and the side effect and efficacy of irinotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer,we designed this study.
