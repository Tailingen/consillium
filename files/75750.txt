DS-8201a in Pre-treated HER2 Breast Cancer That Cannot be Surgically Removed or Has Spread [DESTINY-Breast02]
This study will compare DS 8201a to standard treatment.

Participants must have HER2 breast cancer that has been treated before.

Their cancer:

* cannot be removed by an operation
* has spread to other parts of the body
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Participants With HER2-positive, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Participants Previously Treated With Trastuzumab Emtansine, Progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause., Baseline up to 46 months postdose
Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With HER2-positive, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Participants Previously Treated With Trastuzumab Emtansine, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If there is no death reported for a subject before the data cutoff for OS analysis, OS will be censored at the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive., Baseline up to 46 months postdose|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants With HER2-positive, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Participants Previously Treated With Trastuzumab Emtansine, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), assessed by BICR and investigator assessment based on RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Confirmed ORR based on BICR and Investigator Assessment is reported., Baseline up to 46 months postdose|Duration of Response (DoR) Based on BICR in Participants With HER2-positive, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Participants Previously Treated With Trastuzumab Emtansine, Duration of Response (DoR) was defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. DoR in participants with confirmed CR/PR based on BICR and investigator assessment is reported., Baseline up to 46 months postdose|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Investigator Assessment in Participants With HER2-positive, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Participants Previously Treated With Trastuzumab Emtansine, Progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause., Up to 46 months
The study is designed to compare DS 8201a versus standard of care (investigator's choice) in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with T-DM1.
