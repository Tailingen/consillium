Fatigue Prevalence, Severity, and State of Treatment in Germany
Fatigue is a major concern during and after cancer therapy with severe impact on quality of life. Yet, sound comparable data on fatigue prevalence, severity, and impact on daily life across different tumor entities is lacking. Furthermore, little is known about the current state of screening, counselling and treatment of fatigue.

Thus, the FiX-Study aims to assess such data to identify patient groups with especial need for an improved fatigue management and treatment.

A minimum of n=3000 patients about equally distributed about the 16 most common tumor entities shall be recruited between year 1 and 2 after primary cancer diagnosis via the cancer registry Baden-Württemberg. Data on fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA12, BFI), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), depression and anxiety (PAQ-4), and information about screening and treatment of fatigue will be assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Clinical data regarding tumor and treatment characteristics will be derived from the cancer registry.

This trial is imbedded in a larger research agenda on fatigue and will provide the basis for the development of an individually-tailored fatigue program.
