Volumetric Changes in Large Cystic Lesions Using Active Decompression and Distraction Sugosteogenesis vs Passive Decompression
Null hypothesis active decompression and distraction sugosteogenesis is not faster than passive decompression in volume reduction of large cystic lesions
Odontogenic Cysts
DEVICE: Active decompression
Volume change, Percentage of volume changes over time, 2weeks/one and 6 months
