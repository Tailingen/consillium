Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease that accounts for 1% of all cancers and 10% of all haematological malignancies, most patients with MM develop resistance to existing therapies at the time of disease recurrence.

Belantamab mafodotin is a new humanized antibody-drug conjugate (IgG1) that is under development for the treatment of MM and has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and positive clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MMRR) heavily pretreated.

The objective of this retro-prospective observational study is: to evaluate clinical efficacy as the percentage of patients who have achieved a clinical benefit (minimum or best response), ORR, DoR, PFS, OS; evaluate the safety profile of patients treated with Belantamab Mafodotin as monotherapy in clinical practice.

All patients included in this analysis were treated or are still receiving Belantamab Mafodotin monotherapy under the compassionate use programs (nominal program-NPP and the extended access program-EAP).
