BGB-21447 (Bcl-2 Inhibitor) Combinations for Adults With Hormone-Receptor Positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BGB-21447 (a B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 inhibitor, Bcl-2i) in combination with fulvestrant, with or without BGB-43395 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor, CDK4i), in adults with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.

Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory assessments, and AEs that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after the last dose; up to approximately 6 months|Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDFE) of BGB-21447 in combination with fulvestrant and in combination with fulvestrant and BGB-43395, RDFE of BGB-21447 in combination with fulvestrant and in combination with fulvestrant and BGB-43395 will be determined based upon the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD)., Approximately 6 to 9 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response until the first documentation of progression or death, whichever comes first, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1., Approximately 12 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first CR or PR, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1., Approximately 12 months|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BGB-21447, BGB-43395, and BGB-43395 metabolite, Up to approximately 2 months|Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of BGB-21447, BGB-43395, and BGB-43395 metabolite, Up to approximately 2 months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of BGB-21447, BGB-43395, and BGB-43395 metabolite, Up to approximately 2 months|Apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of BGB-21447, BGB-43395, and BGB-43395 metabolite, Up to approximately 2 months|Food Effect Substudy: AUC of BGB-21447 under fasted and fed state, Up to approximately 2 months|Food Effect Substudy: Cmax of BGB-21447 under fasted and fed state, Up to approximately 2 months
This new study will check how safe and helpful a potential anticancer drug called BGB-21447 (Bcl-2i) is. This drug will be tested in combination with fulvestrant, with or without BGB-43395 (CDK4i), in adults with metastatic breast cancer.

HR+/HER2- tumors account for approximately 70% of all breast cancers and are responsible for most breast cancer-related deaths. While CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have improved outcomes for patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, patients eventually develop progressive disease on these therapies and require new treatments.

BGB-21447 is an oral drug that is highly potent and selectively stops a protein called B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Bcl-2 proteins are often overexpressed in some cancers (like HR+ breast cancer) by keeping the cancer cells from dying. By disrupting this pathway, antitumor effects can be achieved.

BGB-43395 is an oral drug that selectively stops a protein called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). CDK4 is a type of protein that regulates cell growth and division in your body. CDK4 inhibition is believed to have antitumor effects.

Fulvestrant is a treatment that blocks estrogen receptors and reduces estrogen production. Fulvestrant has been approved to treat hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer to help stop the cancer cells from growing.

This combination might be a good way to fight cancer, aiming to give patients the best possible treatment. The study is designed to see if this combination is safe and works well.
