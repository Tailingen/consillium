High-frequency Ultrasound for Intraoperative Lymph Node Assessment in Gynecological Cancer: From Surgery to Radiomics
Lymph node assessment is crucial in gynecological cancers (ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar), as nodal involvement significantly impacts prognosis and treatment. Despite high morbidity, systematic lymphadenectomy has been widely used for staging and treatment planning. However, in most cases, lymph nodes are free from metastasis, making the procedure unnecessary and exposing patients to severe complications such as lymphedema and infections.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation has emerged as a less invasive alternative, reducing unnecessary lymphadenectomies. However, SLN techniques face challenges, including detection failures, inaccurate frozen section analysis, and imaging limitations like false negatives in FDG PET/CT scans. The need for improved intraoperative imaging techniques is emphasized to enhance lymph node assessment, minimize surgical risks, and better tailor treatment approaches.
Gynecologic Cancer
Evaluation of HFUS Accuracy in Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Gynecological Cancer, The aim of this prospective trial is to report the sensivity, specificity, NPV, PPV and accuracy of HFUS in the metastasis detection (macro, micro and ITCs) from fresh, unstained ex vivo/in vivo lymph node samples., Days 20
Minimum Size Detection Limit of HFUS Imaging, To assess the lowest size detectable with the adopted imaging technique, 2 minutes|Development of a Radiomic Algorithm for Lymph Node Assessment, To develop a radiomic algorithm for the assesment of the lymphn node status, 6 months
