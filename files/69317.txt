Study of Longitudinal Plasma PD-L1 Testing With Immunotherapy in Lung Cancer
This is a prospective pilot study to assess dynamic changes of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) PD-L1 expression in patients with lung cancer undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based therapy. Results will be correlated with radiographic assessment of immunotherapy treatment response and plasma NGS ctDNA.
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Circulogene liquid biopsy testing
Correlation of plasma cfRNA PD-L1 by qPCR expression* with ICI treatment and response., Circulogene ImmunoClear Assay, up to 24 months
Correlation of plasma cfRNA PD-L1 expression* results with any available tissue PD-L1 protein expression., Circulogene ImmunoClear Assay, up to 24 months
