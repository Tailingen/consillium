A Registry Study of NanoKnife IRE for Stage 3 Pancreatic Cancer
This multicenter, observational study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the NanoKnife System when used for the ablation of Stage 3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage 3 PC). Eligible patients will be recruited over a 36-month period and participating institutions will enroll and provide data on consecutive patients that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each patient will be followed up for the duration of the study or until death. The study will include two (2) cohorts: patients who received standard of care (SOC) and received irreversible electroporation (IRE) \[IRE cohort\], and patients who were treated with SOC and did not receive IRE \[SOC cohort\].
Stage III Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: SOC|DEVICE: NanoKnife System
Overall Survival, To evaluate the effectiveness of the NanoKnife System when used for the ablation of Stage 3 PC in real world treatment settings, by testing the hypothesis that IRE with the NanoKnife System improves overall survival (OS), Time (in months) from time of enrollment to the date of death for any reason, assessed up to 24 months.
