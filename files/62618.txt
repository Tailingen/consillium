Chidamide, Venetoclax, and Azacitidine for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of chidamide combined with venetoclax and azacitidine in the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not suitable for intensive chemotherapy.
AML|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: azacitidine
Composite complete remission rate, Composite complete remission rate after 2 cycles of treatment \[Complete remission, CR) + complete remission with incomplete blood count (CR with incomplete blood count recovery, CRi); CR + CRi \], 2 months
Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR), including complete remission (Complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count (CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), morphological leukemia free state (MLFS), and partial remission (PR) as a percentage of the total number of patients participating in the efficacy analysis., 24months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death. Subjects who have not died will be censored on the last date they are known to be alive ., 24months|MRD response rate, Minimal residual disease (MRD)rate: defined as less than 0.1% remaining blasts per white blood cell, as measured by bone marrow examination. Other thresholds can also be explored and correlated with efficacy results. Subjects who are randomized but not assessed for MRD will be considered MRD response rate non-responders. The proportion of subjects achieving an MRD response (CR + CRi) was calculated., 24months
