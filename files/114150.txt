A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Tislelizumab in Combination With Golidocitinib and Selinexor for the Treatment of R/R NKTCL
This open-label, multicenter Ib/II phase clinical trial investigates the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of tislezumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody), golidocitinib (JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor), and selinexor (selective inhibitor of nuclear export, XPO1 antagonist) in patients with relapsed/refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (R/R ENKTL) progressing after ≥1 line of L-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

This phase Ib/II open-label, multicenter clinical trial addresses the critical unmet need in relapsed/refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (R/R ENKTL), an aggressive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype characterized by extranodal predominance, angiocentric growth patterns, and geographic prevalence in Asian and Latin American populations. Despite incorporation of L-asparaginase-based regimens into first-line therapy, approximately 30-40% of patients experience primary refractory disease or relapse, with median overall survival (OS) of \<6 months in PD-1 inhibitor-resistant cohorts and limited sustained responses to salvage therapies, highlighting the imperative for novel mechanism-driven combinations. The investigational triplet regimen-comprising tislelizumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody), golidocitinib (JAK1/STAT3 inhibitor), and selinexor (XPO1 antagonist)-was rationally designed to exploit synergistic mechanisms targeting ENKTL pathogenesis: PD-1 blockade reverses T-cell exhaustion, JAK/STAT3 inhibition disrupts constitutive oncogenic signaling (e.g., STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation), and XPO1 antagonism promotes nuclear retention of tumor suppressors (p53, IkBα) while destabilizing EBV latency proteins. Part 1 (Phase Ib) employs dose escalation across combinatorial cohorts to establish the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), prioritizing safety and tolerability through rigorous assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), while Part 2 (Phase II) evaluates preliminary efficacy in a dedicated anti-PD-1-refractory population, focusing on objective response rate (ORR) by Lugano 2014 criteria as the primary endpoint. The trial specifically targets patients with histologically confirmed ENKTL per WHO classification and radiographically confirmed progression post-L-asparaginase-containing therapy and failed to prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, excluding those with prior exposure to JAK or XPO1 inhibitors to isolate the novel therapeutic effect. By integrating PD-1 pathway modulation with simultaneous disruption of STAT3-driven survival signals and viral oncoprotein dependencies, this combination strategy aims to discover the potential therapeutic paradigms for R/R ENKTL, particularly in populations failing contemporary immunochemotherapy approaches.
