Study Comparing AlloVax™ to Chemotherapy in Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head & Neck
Phase II, Randomized, Non-Inferiority Study Comparing an Individualized Cancer Vaccine (AlloVax™) to Chemotherapy in Subjects with R/M SCCHN .
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck
BIOLOGICAL: AlloVax™|DRUG: Cisplatin
Safety and tolerability (vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory profile, adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.0 and dose limiting toxicity (DLT)), Whether AlloVax™ is less toxic than chemotherapy. will be evaluated on the basis of the following parameters: vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory profile, adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.0 and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 119 days|Overall Survival, Whether AlloVax™ is not inferior to the active chemotherapy control (from time of randomization). Subjects are followed for survival during the trial and as long as they are alive after the last study treatment through follow-up, 119 days
Health related Quality of Life (HRQoL), QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H\&N35 questionnaires, 119 days
RECIST, Response and correlation with pathology assessment, 119 days|Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), Response and correlation with pathology assessment, 119 days|Immune response in the treatment arm, Correlation of OS with immune response, 119 days
All accrued subjects will be randomized 2:1 to AlloVax™ (CRCL + AlloStim™) immunotherapy vs. standard chemotherapy. AlloVax™ is an experimental individualized therapeutic vaccine shown to be active in this study population.

The standard chemotherapy arm (Arm 1) will receive up to six three-week cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin on day 0 of the 3-week cycle at dose 80-100 mg/m2 IV followed by 1000 mg/m2 IV flurouracil (5FU) on days 1-4 of the cycle.

The immunotherapy arm (Arm 2) will receive immunotherapy (AlloVax™) twice a week for 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks for an additional 12 weeks.

The study is designed and powered to determine if AlloVax™ is not inferior to the active chemotherapy control.
