Molecular Basis of Langerhans and Non-Langerhans Cell Histiocytic Neoplasms and Castleman Disease
The purpose of this study is to use agnostic genomic evaluation using whole exome sequencing (WES) of a variety of rare hematologic diseases grouped under rare blood diseases and its variants to further elucidate the understanding of the chemistry of these disorders and identify potential actionable mutations that can be targeted with therapies in the context of clinical trials.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Genetic testing
Proportion of genomic analyses yielding genetic aberrations, Proportion of genomic analyses yielding actionable genetic aberrations. "Actionable" is defined as a mutation linked to an approved therapy in the particular disease under study or another disease, a known or suspected contraindication to a given therapy, or a clinical trial linked to the alteration, Up to 12 months from last participant accrued

The study team will examine genetic changes, also known as mutations, in the DNA of participants' blood, or if applicable, bone marrow specimen. These types of tests are increasingly used by doctors to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and make decisions during care. This study seeks to understand how many patients will benefit from this testing, and in what ways. The results of this portion of the study are placed in the individual's medical record and are communicated back to each participant.
