A Phase II Study on Dose Optimization of Fruquintinib in Elderly mCRC Patients Refractory to Standard Treatment（DOFEMCRC）
A Phase II study on dose optimization of fruquintinib in elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients refractory to standard treatment.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib
PFS, Progression-free survival is determined from the date of treatment to PD or death from any cause, about a year
Safety and tolerability, Version 5.0 and AEs leading to dose interruption or discontinuation., about a year|ORR, Objective Response Rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version. 1.1, about a year|DCR, Disease Control Rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version. 1.1, about a year|OS, OS is the time interval from the start of treatment to death due to any reason or lost of follow-up, about a year|Correlation between geriatric assessment and efficacy and safety, Statistical results obtained by analyzing the patient's geriatric assessment against efficacy and safety, about a year
This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, phase II study. In this study, the low-dose initial dose incremental optimization scheme was used in the first cycle in patients ≥65 years old who need to receive fruquintinib. The aim is to observe the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fruquintinib in elderly patients with mCRC refractory to standard treatment. The correlation between the efficacy, toxicity and geriatric evaluation of fruquintinib will also be analysed.
