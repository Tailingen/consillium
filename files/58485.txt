Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to define whether 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a higher rate of complete cytoreductive surgery compared with 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by surgery
Percentage of patients who obtain a complete cytoreduction (no macroscopic residual tumor) at surgery , as a comparative outcome measure of 3 vs 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, The primary objective of this study is to define whether 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a higher rate of complete cytoreductive surgery compared with 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with bulky stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer, within 6 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy
Percentage of patients with grade 3-5 perioperative toxicity (according to CTCAE), as a measure of safety, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a lower rate of perioperative grade 3-5 toxicities. The surgical adverse events are defined as:

* intraoperative, which occur during surgical procedure
* perioperative , which occur from day 1 to day 7 after surgery
* postoperative, which occur from day 8 to 30 days after surgery

Adverse events list for surgical procedures:

Postoperative death (\<30 days); Hemorrhage/bleeding intraoperative or postoperative requiring at least transfusion of 2 units of non-autologous red blood cells; Vascular events: thrombosis/embolism, disabling or life-threatening vessel injury-artery or vein, symptomatic or life-threatening visceral arterial ischemia; Infections requiring IV antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral interventions or at risk for life-threatening consequences; Gastrointestinal fistula; Urinary fistula; Lymphocele, requiring medical or operative intervention., within 30 days after surgery|Percentage of patients with pathological complete response, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with higher rate of pathological complete response.

Complete pathological response is defined as the absence of cancer cells in surgical specimens, and very good partial remission is defined as the persistence of only small clusters (\< 1 cm) or individual cancer cells and no macroscopic residual after surgery. Partial pathological remission is defined as a tumor burden reduction between 30 and 90% at surgery, while stable disease is defined as no tumour burden reduction or reduction lower than 30% at surgery, compared with initial diagnostic laparoscopy. Only patients with complete and very good partial remissions are considered as pathological responders, while all the other cases are considered as pathological non-responders., after surgery, up to 1 month after surgery|Rate of progression-free survival, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival., from date of randomization until the date of disease progression or second cancer or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed for 10 years after the end of chemotherapy|Health related quality of life, To compare the quality of life in the two treatment groups, from baseline to safety follow-up visit (30-34 days after surgery)|Rate of radiological responses, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a higher rate of radiological responses (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria)., at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, before surgery|Rate of decrease of CA125 levels during NACT, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a greater decrease of CA125 levels., from cycle 1 of chemotherapy to safety follow-up visit (30-34 days after surgery)|Rate of overall survival, To determine whether a longer duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with longer overall survival., from date of randomization until date of death due to any cause, assessed until 10 years after the end of chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to define whether 6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a higher rate of complete cytoreductive surgery compared with 3 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.
