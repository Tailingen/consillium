A Phase Ⅱ Clinical Trial of Camrelizumab for Adjuvant Treatment of Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 for adjuvant treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: SHR-1210
RFS(relapse free survival), Recurrence free survival of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with SHR-1210, up to 1 year|DFS（disease-free survival）, Disease-free survival of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with SHR-1210, up to 1 year
OS（overall survival rate）, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause; Overall survival rate of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with SHR-1210, At time of surgery
Exploratory analysis of biomarkers for predicting efficacy, The relationship between PD-L1 dynamic expression, ctDNA sequencing and therapeutic effect was evaluated, At time of surgery
Although esophagectomy is still the standard treatment for patients with localized esophageal cancer, the long-term therapeutic effect is not satisfactory.About 50% of patients experienced relapse in the first year after treatment. The 5-year survival rate of esophageal cancer patients treated by surgery is still less than 30%. Although the effect of preoperative treatment is relatively clear, the effect of postoperative treatment, especially postoperative chemotherapy, is still controversial and no consensus has been reached.The basic reason is that the postoperative trauma of esophageal cancer is large, and the patients' tolerance to chemotherapy is poor. The efficacy of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in metastatic ESCC has been recognized.We plan to conduct a phase II multicenter, single arm, open phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humanized anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 in adjuvant treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
