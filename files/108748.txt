A Platform Study of Novel Immunotherapy Combinations in Participants With Previously Untreated, Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PDy) of novel immunotherapy combinations compared with immunotherapy monotherapy in participants with Programmed death ligand-1 (PD L-1) high (Tumor cells \[TC\]/ Tumor proportion score \[TPS\] \>= 50%), previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Drug name mentioned as Belrestotug, GSK4428859A, and EOS884448 are all interchangeable for the same compound. In the rest of the document, the drug will be referred to as Belrestotug.

AESI are any Adverse Event (AE) (serious or non-serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment and include infusion related reaction and immune-related adverse event (irAEs) from the date of enrollment to 90 days after last dose of study treatment., Up to 5 years|Number of participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment assessed by the investigator based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 from the date of enrollment to 90 days after last dose of study treatment., Up to 5 years|Number of participants with TEAEs or SAEs leading to dose modifications (including dose delay and study intervention discontinuation), Up to 5 years|Number of participants with positive antidrug antibodies (ADA) against belrestotug, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays., Up to 24 months|Number of participants with positive ADA against dostarlimab, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays., Up to 24 months|Number of participants with positive ADA against Nelistotug, Serum samples will be collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays., Up to 24 months|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) for belrestotug, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of belrestotug., Up to 24 months|Cmax for dostarlimab, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of dostarlimab., Up to 24 months|Cmax for Nelistotug, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of Nelistotug., Up to 24 months|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) for belrestotug, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of belrestotug., Up to 24 months|Cmin for dostarlimab, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of dostarlimab., Up to 24 months|Cmin for Nelistotug, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of Nelistotug., Up to 24 months
