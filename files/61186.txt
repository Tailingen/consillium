Investigating the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) on the Treatment of Subjects With CRPC
Studies objectives:

To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ACC given in combination with ZA or with Denosumab as compared to placebo given with ZA or with Denosumab as outline below:

* Safety and Tolerability:
* Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs
* Safety laboratory measurements
* Hypercalcemic and hypercalciuric episodes
* Treatment withdrawal due to AEs and overall

Efficacy:

* Skeletal Related Events (SREs)
* Measurable and evaluable disease progression
* Progression Free Survival (PFS)
* Pain assessment via the VAS scale
Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Metastasis
DRUG: Amorphous calcium carbonate|OTHER: Placebo
Changes in the number of Skeletal Related Events (SREs), Bone scan will take place at baseline and week 12
Time from randomization to onset of first SRE., Bone scan will be made on baseline and week 12|Proportion of subjects (%) with SREs., Bone scan will take place at baseline and week 12|Proportion of subjects (%) with evidence of measureable and evaluable disease progression or SREs., Bone scan will take place at baseline and week 12|Progression Free Survival (PFS)., CT or MRI will be assessed on screening and week 12|Number of subjects that are receiving radiation as a rescue treatment, An assessment will take place at week 2,4,6,8,10,12 16,20 and 24|Frequency and incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Safety assessment will take place at week 2,4,6,8,10,12 16,20 and 24|Frequency and incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)., Safety assessment will take place at weeks 2,4,6,8,10,12 16,20 and 24|Proportion of subjects (%) with hypercalcemic DLTs., Safety assessment will be made at weeks 2,4,6,8,10,12 16,20 and 24|Proportion of subjects (%) with any DLTs., Safety assessment will take place at weeks 2,4,6,8,10,12 16,20 and 24|Number of hypercalciuric events., Urine calcium levels will be examined by urine tests, taking place at weeks 4,8,12,16,20 and 24
