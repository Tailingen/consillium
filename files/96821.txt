Evaluating an Alternative Clinical Genetics Cancer Care Delivery Model: A Pilot Study of Patient Outcomes
This study will evaluate patients' experiences with having gynecologic or prostate medical oncologists and surgeons offer them genetic testing, and having genetic counselors return the test results to patients over the telephone. This is different from the usual approach to genetic testing, where gynecologic or prostate medical oncologists and surgeons refer their patients to a genetic counselor in order to have these tests done, and the genetic counselors return the test results to the patient in person or over the telephone. The investigators will only be evaluating this alternative way of providing genetic testing to ovarian or prostate cancer patients.
