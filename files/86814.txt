A Phase 1 Trial of CBL0137 in Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Advanced Solid Neoplasm
This is an open-label, multi-center, sequential groups, dose-escalation study of CBL0137 administered intravenously in participants with metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies.
Solid Tumors|Glioblastoma
DRUG: CBL0137
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), MTD is defined as dose level at which ≥6 participants have been treated and which is associated with a first-cycle DLT in ≤17% of the participants. Selection of RP2D from within the tolerated dose range will be based on evaluation of short- and long-term safety information together with findings relating to compliance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CBL0137. The secondary objectives are to describe the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse event profile of CBL0137, to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of CBL0137, to document any objective responses to CBL0137. This is a study of CBL0137 with a standard "3+3" design. Escalation will proceed to the MTD based on DLT in the 1st cycle in 1 of 6 participants in a cohort.
