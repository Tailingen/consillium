A Study of IBI310 for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and efficacy of single agent of IBI310, and in combination of sintilimab, in patients with advanced solid tumors(Ia) and advanced melanoma(Ib).
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: IBI310|DRUG: Sintilimab
AEs, Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events (AEs), up to 24 months after randomization
Pharmacokinetics：Cmax, Maximum concentration(Cmax) of the drug after administration, up to 24 months after randomization|pharmacodynamics:lipid parameters, Change from baseline in lipid parameters, up to 24 months after randomization|ADA, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies or neutralizing antibodies, up to 24 months after randomization|Pharmacokinetics：AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration, up to 24 months after randomization
Phase Ia study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose is 0.3 mg/kg, followed by 3 dose cohorts (1mg/kg, 2mg/kg and 3mg/kg). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period is 21 days. IBI310 treatment q3w, up to 3 cycles, will be provided to patients who complete DLT observation period.

Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by RECIST v1.1. Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity will be assessed throughout the study.

Phase Ib study will evaluate the tolerability and safety of IBI310 combined with Sintilimab in patients with advanced melanoma. Phase Ib of the study will begin after DLT observation is completed in certain dose cohorts.
