A Study of ZN-c3 in Participants With Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study of ZN-c3 monotherapy which consists of Dose Escalation, a Food Effect Cohort, and Dose Expansion.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ZN-c3
Dose Escalation, To investigate the safety and tolerability of single agent ZN-c3, including identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), based on the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in DLT-evaluable subjects., Through completion, average of 1 year|Food Effect Cohort, To characterize and compare the PK (Cmax.) of ZN-c3 following a single dose of ZN-c3 under fed and fasting conditions., Through completion, approx 6 months|Food Effect Cohort, To characterize and compare the PK (Tmax) of ZN-c3 following a single dose of ZN-c3 under fed and fasting conditions., Through completion, approximately 6 months|Food Effect Cohort, To characterize and compare the PK (AUC0-last,AUC0-âˆž) of ZN-c3 following a single dose of ZN-c3 under fed and fasting conditions., Through completion approximately 6 month|Food Effect Cohort, To characterize and compare the PK (T1/2) of ZN-c3 following a single dose of ZN-c3 under fed and fasting conditions., Through completion, approximately 6 mth|Dose Expansion, To investigate the clinical activity of WEE1 inhibition based on the objective response rate (ORR) as defined by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Through completion, approximately 43 month

This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of ZN-c3.

In Dose Escalation, the study will identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ZN-c3 monotherapy in solid tumors.

The Food Effect cohort sub-study will examine ZN-c3 PK after a single dose and determine the bioavailability of ZN-c3 under fed and fasted conditions.

In Dose Expansion, single agent ZN-c3 will be evaluated at the RP2D in subjects with recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma (USC) or subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies harboring biomarkers related to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage pathways.
