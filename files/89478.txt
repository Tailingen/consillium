Resource-Sparing Curative Treatment for Rectal Cancer
This is a prospective, multicentre, randomized clinical trial comparing two different neo-adjuvant radiation-based strategies prior to intended surgery for locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum.

This trial may establish the investigational therapy to be superior to, or at least not inferior to conventional treatment.
Rectal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Overall Survival, From commencement of radiation (day 1) to death or last follow-up up to 5 years.
Biological Effect and Tumour Biology, Maximum size of the tumor based on imaging and/or up to 3D measures reported by radiologists, comparing baseline and pre-surgical decision inverstigations

If definitive surgery is conducted:

* Proportion obtaining R0
* Proportion undergoing TME
* Status of the neurovascular and neural invasion(s)
* Nodal ratio
* Tumor sizes

CEA results, Prior to surgical decision in weeks 13-15 and 4 weeks after surgery|Quality of Life, From date of randomization till the end of follow-up (5 years)|Health-related Economics, Number of days in hospital

Number of surgical procedures

Number of days with stomas

Protocol required therapies, as actually administered

Adverse events that have significant cost implications (i.e. cost-drivers), From date of randomization till the end of follow-up (5 years)
This phase III randomised clinical trial compares the outcome of two different neo-adjuvant radiation based treatments for locally advanced rectal carcinoma. This encompasses patients at risk for a positive circumfrential resection margin (CRM+) on baseline assessment imaging and pateints identified as being with a T-descriptor T4 at baseline assessment.

The arms compared are as follows:

* The investigational arm: short chemo-radiation course(25Gy in 5 daily fractions over 1 week) +/- surgery.
* The conventional arm: protracted chemo-radiation course (50Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks combined with chemotherapy)+/- surgery.

The outcomes include four domains: overall survival, biological effect, quality of life and health-related economics.
