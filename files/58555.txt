CAncer TReatment INformed by the Molecular Tumor Board At Dartmouth
This is a single-arm Phase II study to measure the impact of Molecular Tumor Board treatment recommendations on treatment decision-making in clinical practice at the Dartmouth Cancer Center. Following tumor genetic profiling, subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects' cases will be evaluated by the Dartmouth Cancer Center Molecular Tumor Board, and treatment recommendations will be entered into the medical record as per standard procedure.

The primary endpoint is a survey response from the treating physician indicating how Molecular Tumor Board evaluation impacted treatment decisions. Secondary endpoints include: 1) Molecular Tumor Board treatment recommendation; 2) disease progression on line of therapy started after MTB recommendations were made. Surveys will be administered approximately 3 and 12 months after Molecular Tumor Board recommendations are made.
