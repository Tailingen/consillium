Mechanism Underlying the Link Between Hearing Loss and Cognition
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if hearing devices, like hearing aids and cochlear implants, affect social and cognitive function of older adults. The main questions the researchers want to answer are:

* How social are older adults with hearing loss before and after using hearing devices?
* How well do older adults with hearing loss think before and after using hearing devices?
* For older adults who have hearing loss and use hearing devices, do changes in social interaction explain changes in how well they think (cognitive function)?
* Do brainwaves (EEGs) in older adults with hearing loss change after using hearing devices?
* Are there differences in how social older adults with hearing loss are compared to older adults without hearing loss?

What Participants Will Do:

* Participants will take questionnaires for around 60 minutes. Questionnaires will ask participants about their background, health, hearing, and how social they are. Another set of questionnaires will check their thinking ability or cognition.
* Participants will wear an audio sensor for 2 weeks. The sensor will collect and store information about a participant's voice during conversations. Once the device has information about a participant's voice such as pitch and tone it will store this information and delete the audio recording. Words spoken during conversations will be deleted.
* (Optional) Participants can choose to participate in a 45-60-minute EEG (electroencephalogram) recording session. Participants will have sensors placed on top of their heads. Sensors will record the participants' brainwaves. Sounds will be played to see how participants' brainwaves change when they hear sounds.
Hearing Loss, Bilateral (Causes Other Than Tumors)
DEVICE: Hearing aid use
Cognitive test- MoCA, MoCA (MoCA-Basic if appropriate) score, Baseline and 4-month after hearing aid use
Cognitive Test- Digit Span Test, Cognitive Test- Digit Span Test, Baseline, 4-month after hearing aid use|Audio sensor- speech arousal, The audio sensor employs deep-learning-based multimodal speech pattern modeling of participants' own voice activities to extract speech arousal and speech activities. Speech arousal measures include the percentage of strong arousals, serving as a proxy of enhanced engagement in conversations., Baseline, 4-month after hearing aid use|Audio sensor- speech activity, The audio sensor employs deep-learning-based multimodal speech pattern modeling of participants' own voice activities to extract speech arousal and speech activities. Speech activity measures include the intersession time (the interval between speech sessions, representing the frequency of conversation engagement)., Baseline and 4-month after hearing aid use|EEG Measures, EEG Event Related Potentials (ERPs) are measures of cortical activities in response to auditory stimuli and provide information about cognitive processing, memory, and attention. Participants will complete auditory oddball tasks during EEG measurements and ERPs including P1, N1, P2, MMN, P3 will be recorded., Baseline, 4-month after hearing aid use|Auditory oddball task, Auditory oddball task discrimination sensitivity, Baseline and 4-mo after hearing aid use
