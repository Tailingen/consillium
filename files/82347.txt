EUS-RFA PANCARDINAL-1 Trial
The objectives of this study are to determine the feasibility, tolerability, and treatment effect of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus standard-of-care neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) will be performed before tumor resection surgery, with the goal of shrinking a tumor or stopping the spread of cancer so that surgery might be less invasive and more effective.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
DEVICE: Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)|DRUG: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC)
Number of participants who are able to complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus EUS-RFA and later undergo surgical tumor resection, From the time of EUS-RFA NAC intervention to the time of surgical tumor resection (about 5-6 months)
Radiographic treatment response as assessed by standard Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria, Using the RECIST criteria, treatment response is categorized as follows:

* Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD
* Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started
* Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, 2 months after the initiation of chemotherapy|Radiographic treatment response as assessed by standard Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria, Using the RECIST criteria, treatment response is categorized as follows:
