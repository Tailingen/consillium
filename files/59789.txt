A Study of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With Pegfilgrastim Supported by Haematopoietic Progenitor Cell Re-Infusion in Whole Blood
The purpose of this study is to provide dose-finding information regarding the efficacy and kinetics of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilisation by pegfilgrastim and to determine if carboplatin/paclitaxel can be delivered at a reduced cycle interval when supported by pegfilgrastim-mobilised PBPCs in whole blood.
