68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients
This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD in prostate cancer patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD
Standardized uptake value of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD in prostate cancer, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tracer in prostate cancer will be measured., 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients and patients will be followed and assessed., 1 week
Both GRPR and integrin αvβ3 are overexpressed in neoplastic cells of human prostate cancer. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide BBN-RGD was synthesized from bombesin(7-14) and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastasis prostate cancer.
