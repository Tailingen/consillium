Safety and Efficacy of Cyclophosphamide, Sorafenib, Bevacizumab, and Atezolizumab in Pediatric Solid Tumor Patients
This is a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety of combining intravenous (IV) atezolizumab and bevacizumab every three weeks, with daily oral cyclophosphamide and pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided sorafenib in children and adolescent and young adults (AYA) with relapsed or refractory solid malignancies (Part 1), and then evaluate the response rate of this combination in children, AYA with relapsed or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other rare solid malignancies (Part 2).

Primary Objectives Part 1

* To establish the safety associated with the administration of the combination of cyclophosphamide, PK-guided sorafenib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab in children and AYA with relapsed or refractory solid tumors
* To determine if sorafenib systemic exposure can be successfully targeted to an AUC between 20 and 55 hr·µg/mL by Day 21 of cycle 1 in 60% of evaluable patients, when given in combination with cyclophosphamide, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab in children and AYA with relapsed or refractory solid tumors

Part 2

* To evaluate the response rate (CR+PR) of the combination of cyclophosphamide, PK-guided sorafenib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab in children and AYA with relapsed or refractory HCC following two cycles of therapy
* To determine if the use of PK-guided sorafenib dosing to maintain a systemic exposure between 20 and 55 reduces the interpatient pharmacokinetic variability of sorafenib and the incidence of sorafenib- induced skin toxicities in children and AYA with relapsed or refractory HCC and other rare solid tumors

Parts 1 \& 2

* To determine if the combination of cyclophosphamide, PK-guided sorafenib and atezolizumab will result in increased intratumoral T-cell infiltration of CD8+C45RO+ cells between baseline and following two courses of therapy in pediatric children and AYA with relapsed or refractory solid tumors following two cycles of therapy

Part 1 (safety/tolerability): Children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors with biopsy accessible and evaluable disease will be treated with two courses of oral PK-guided sorafenib (starting area under the curve (AUC) target: 20-55 ug/ml/hr), oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg/m2/dose, daily (qd) x 21 days), IV bevacizumab (15 mg/kg/dose, every (q) 21 days) and IV atezolizumab (15 mg/kg \[max dose 1200 mg\] q 21 days). Tumor biopsies are required before starting treatment and after course two (Section 4.1). Biopsied tissue will be used for enrollment on MAST and to evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration. Sorafenib PK will be obtained and dose adjusted to target an AUC between 20 and 55 hr·µg/mL by Day 21 of C1. Tolerability will be defined after completion of Course 1. Part 2 will begin once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined.

Part 2 (efficacy): Children and AYA with relapsed or refractory HCC will be treated with two courses of oral cyclophosphamide and sorafenib with IV bevacizumab and atezolizumab based on the RP2D from Part 1. Tumor response will be assessed after two courses according to immunologic and imaging criteria (Section 4.1). Eligible patients with Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FL-HCC), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) or non-central nervous system (CNS) malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) will be enrolled on separate strata but target accrual will be determined by patients with HCC.
