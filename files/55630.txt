Shrinking Target Adaptive Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study aims to use a type of radiation (adaptive radiotherapy) to deliver curative-intent treatment to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors would otherwise be too large for standard curative treatment. The study will use adaptive radiotherapy to achieve these goals. Adaptive radiotherapy is a process whereby treatment plans are modified during the course of treatment due to patient and tumor variations (ie. weight loss or tumor shrinkage). This may allow for dose escalation, while limiting the side effects.
