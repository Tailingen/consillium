Effects of Avmacol® in the Oral Mucosa of Patients Following Curative Treatment for Tobacco-related Head and Neck Cancer
Avmacol is an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing broccoli seed and sprout extracts in tablet form, hypothesized to activate protective cellular pathways including detoxication. In this study, participants who have been curatively treatment for head and neck cancer, will take Avmacol twice a day for 3 months.

Change in NRF2 target gene expression, Quantitative changes in NRF2 target gene transcripts expression (i.e. NQO1 and GCLC) in oral mucosa (buccal cytobrush) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) according to a linear mixed model framework., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months
Change in NRF2 target proteins, Changes in NRF2 target proteins in buccal punch biopsies by immunoblotting., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Change in NRF2 target gene transcripts, Change in NRF2 target gene transcripts, between the two doses of Avmacol® by immunoblotting., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Change in NRF2-independent proteins, Change in NRF2 target gene transcripts, between the two doses of Avmacol® by immunoblotting., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Alterations of Avmacol® activity in PBMCs - NK cells, Changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) gene expression and flow cytometry patterns in NK cells., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Alterations of Avmacol® activity in PBMCs - T cells, Changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) gene expression and flow cytometry patterns in T cells., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Change in serum cytokine levels, Change in serum cytokine levels, as determined by multiplexed bead-based cytokine assays., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Measurement of serum albumin-bound SF, Measurement of urinary metabolites of SF using isotope dilution mass spectrometry., From baseline throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Safety profile in accordance with NCI CTCAE v.4, Patients will receive a diary for daily logging of adverse events. This will tabulated by Avmacol dose and type and grade of adverse events. The mean frequency and grade of events will be calculated by dose, and between-dose differences compared by means, Throughout treatment period, up to 4 months|Proportion of patients primary tumors harboring genomic alteration of NRF2 related genes, Genomic alterations in primary tumors will be characterized and the proportion determined by number of patients with NRF2 related genes per the total number of patients studied., At baseline
The broccoli seed preparation, Avmacol®, results in acute and/or sustained induction of NRF2 target gene transcripts in the oral mucosa of patients who have been curatively treated for a tobacco-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), including high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma. This study is not designed to examine the therapeutic or reparative effects of Avmacol® on premalignant lesions of the oral cavity.

We will systematically assess the clinical chemopreventive potential of Avmacol® administration to patients with tobacco-related HNSCC at high risk for second primary tumor by:

1. Conducting this phase 0 clinical study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic range of NRF2 pathway activation in the oral mucosa of HNSCC patients, in response to two tolerable and bioactive doses of Avmacol®;
2. Determining whether the level of NRF2 pathway activation achieved in human oral epithelium is chemopreventive in the NQO1 murine model of environmental carcinogenesis; and
3. Analyzing specimens from the Phase 0 trial to determine whether Avmacol® induces changes in alternative biomarkers of SF chemopreventive efficacy identified in the laboratory.
