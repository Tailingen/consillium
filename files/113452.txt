This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b study of RMC-6291 in combination with RMC-6236 in participants with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors, to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule (RP2DS) and provide a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of RMC-6291 in participants with KRASG12C tumors.

The study consists of two parts: Part 1 - Dose-Escalation and Part 2 Dose-Expansion.
