From January 2019 to December 2019, who underwent physical examination in Peking University Third Hospital were included in the study. The expression levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),α-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carbohydrate antigen-125 (CA-125), carbohydrate antigen 72-4(CA 72-4), carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), carbohydrate antigen 242(CA 242), squamous cell carcinoma antigen（SCC）, CYFRA21-1, total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA ) , free prostate-specific antigen(FPSA), neuron specific enolase(NSE) were detected by Electro chemistry luminescence method. The positive rates of TM were analyzed by descriptive statistical method Explore. The differences between different age and sex groups and the influencing factors were explored by statistic by Inferential statistical method.
