Tumor Response in Hypofractionated Radiotherapy
This study will follow-up different immune cell populations in the blood before, during and after high dose radiation therapy which should give new information of the efficacy of Local Hypofractionated Radiotherapy and a rationale for adjuvant immunotherapy.
Neoplasms
Percentage of immune cells, The primary endpoint is the change of the percentage of immune cells before, during and after radiotherapy, prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy;14(±2) days from the begining of RT; the day (±2) of the last radiotherapy sessions ;one month, 3 months after the last radiotherapy session
Local control, Local control of radiotherapy will be assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST)1.1, 3 months|Acute and Late toxicities, Acute and late toxicities will be assessed based on the common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 4.0 (CTCAEv4.0)., 3 months
* Patient information and collection of a signed informed consent form
* Clinical data collection
* Blood samples of 5 mL:

  1. after registration, prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy
  2. during radiotherapy sessions
  3. one month, 3 months after the last radiotherapy session
* Storage of the blood samples at ambient temperature
* Transportation of the samples to the Institute of Biology of Lille (IBL) - CNRS UMR8161 for analysis
* Destruction of the samples at the end of the analysis
