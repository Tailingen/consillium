GIC-102, Intravenous Allogeneic NK Cells, in Subjects With Advanced Solid Cancers and R/R Hematologic Malignancies
This is a first-in-human trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effects of GIC-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors, relapsed/refractory non-hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

This is a first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation and expansion phase 1/2a trial to determine the safety profile and identify the maximum tolerated dose of GIC-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors, relapsed/refractory non-hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

This study will comprise two phases.

* GIC-102 monotherapy dose escalation Phase
* GIC-102 monotherapy dose expansion phase

GIC-102 is an "off-the-shelf" allogeneic natural killer cells isolated from non-HLA-related healthy donor. Natural killer cells are innate immune cells that show strong cytolytic function against physiologically stressed cells such as tumor cells and virus infected cells.
