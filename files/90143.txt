Effect of Physical Therapy on Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema
The objective of this study is to investigate if Complete Decongestive Therapy is equally effective whether it includes manual lymphatic drainage or not in the treatment of lymphoedema among patients with breast cancer.
Lymphoedema|Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Physical TherapyA|PROCEDURE: Physical TherapyB
The percentage volume reduction of lymphoedema (%), 7 months
Differences in circumference of the arm (composite outcome measure), bodyweight, patient sensation of heaviness, patient sensation of tension, and quality of life, Circumference of the arm consists of 7 measurements but these will be converted to one outcome measure when estimating the difference between baseline and post intervention measurements, 7 months
Percentage volume reduction of lymphedema (%) from baseline to week 4. Percentage volume reduction of lymphedema (%) from week 4 to week 7, 7 months
Physical therapy treatment of patients with lymphoedema includes treatment based on the principles of 'Complete Decongestive Therapy' (CDT). CDT consists of following components; skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging and exercises. Regarding what type of treatment of treatments is most effective, the scientific evidence is sparse. Studies have focused on the time-consuming manual lymphatic drainage, but the scientific evidence is not consistent.

A randomized, single-blind, equivalence trial. A total of 160 breast cancer patients with lymphoedema will be recruited from 3 hospitals and randomised into one of two treatment groups: A: Complete Decongestive TherapyA (incl. manual drainage) or B: Complete Decongestive TherapyB (except manual lymphatic drainage
