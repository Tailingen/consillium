Canadian Profiling and Targeted Agent Utilization Trial (CAPTUR)
Cancer drugs which target the effects of abnormal gene changes are called 'targeted therapies'. This study, called PM.1 or CAPTUR, will include some targeted therapies that are currently available. The purpose of this study is to find out what are the effects on a patient and their cancer when they are given a targeted therapy drug that is specific to an abnormal gene change in their cancer.

Recent advances in laboratory technology have enabled the identification of changes in the genetic makeup of tumors that might be responsible for their malignant behavior such as uncontrolled growth and spread. Some of these changes can be 'druggable', i.e. there may be cancer medicines that can specifically act on the tumour's genetic abnormality. Several cancer centers and programs have initiated this type of molecular profiling across Canada, with the goal to identify 'druggable' changes in tumors to find matching therapy for patients. These include initiatives in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The CAnadian Profiling and Targeted agent Utilization tRial (CAPTUR) will test the activity of a list of commercially available targeted agents in patients who have undergone tumor profiling and have 'druggable' changes identified in their cancers.
