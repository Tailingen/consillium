Repurposing the Antipsychotic Drug Chlorpromazine as Adjuvant Therapeutic Agent for Resected Stage III Colon Cancer
chlorpromazine displays a series of remarkable bio-molecular effects in cancer cells, as inhibition of cell growth, nuclear aberrations, inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammilian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) axis, induction of cytotoxic autophagy, inhibition of glutamate and DRD2 receptors. This study will evaluate the addition of chlorpromazine to the first-line therapeutic protocol in colon cancer stage III.
