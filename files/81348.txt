Reirradiation With Pembrolizumab in Locoregional Inoperable Recurrence or Second Primary Squamous Cell CA of the Head and Neck

Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell of Head and Neck
RADIATION: Reirradiation|DRUG: MK-3475
Progression Free Survival, Number of months from the date of initiation of treatment to the date of progression of disease or death (whichever occurs first). Progressive disease, per RECIST 1.1, is defined as: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., Up to 36 months (after starting reirradiation and MK-3475)
Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of the patients who have either Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm, or, Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. The patient's best overall response rate defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression will be recorded, per RECIST 1.1., Up to 36 months (after initiation of treatment with reirradiation and MK-3475)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The percentage of patients that have achieved a complete response, partial response, and stable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm, Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, or Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Up to 36 months (after initiation of treatment with reirradiation and MK-3475)|Time to in Field Disease Progression, Number of months from initiation of treatment to progression of disease within the radiation field.Progressive disease, per RECIST 1.1, is defined as: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., Up to 36 months (after initiation of treatment with reirradiation and MK-3475)|Overall Survival (OS), Number of months from first treatment until death.

Each participant will undergo screening and then be treated with reirradiation with 1.2 Gy BID, 5 days a week (weeks 1-5). MK-3475 (generic name: pembrolizumab, trade name Keytruda®) will be given at 200mg intravenous every 3 weeks starting day one of reirradiation and will be continued in all participants until 3 months post completion of reirradiation, at which time a PET/CT will be done to evaluate response. Participants with progressive disease (PD) will be taken off MK-3475 and followed for survival. Participants that have a complete response (CR) will be followed clinically and radiographically, and if disease recurs may be eligible to be retreated with MK-3475 for up to one year. Participants with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) will continue treatment with MK-3475 for up to two years unless one of the following occurs:

* documented disease progression
* unacceptable adverse event(s)
* intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
* investigator decision to withdraw the subject
* withdrawal of consent
* pregnancy
* noncompliance
* administrative reasons (i.e. trial is closed prematurely).

Participants who have not progressed at completion of 24 months of therapy will be observed, but may be eligible for 1 year of retreatment with MK-3475 if they develop recurrence/progression and qualify for retreatment as detailed in the protocol,and if the trial is still ongoing.
