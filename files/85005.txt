Mirena® ± Metformin as Fertility-preserving Treatment for Young Asian Women With Early Endometrial Cancer
Primary objective To discover the efficacies of levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device (LNG-IUS, Mirena®), with or without metformin, as fertility-preserving treatment for grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium, cT1aN0M0 with presumed no myometrial invasion on image study (MRI preferred).

Secondary objectives

1. To discover the morphological and molecular change in the endometrium tumor before and after treatment
2. To discover the effectiveness of adding oral progestin to subjects who show no good response to assigned
3. To compare (1) the systemic effects, including body weight change, neuropsychiatric alternation, GI disturbance, skin disorder, change in serum metabolic and hepatic markers between the two study patient groups; (2) The rate of long-term success defined as (a) sustained remission of \>= 12 months starts from the histologic documentation of complete remission (b) rate of pregnancy and (c) alive baby delivery, based on time-to-event analysis.
4. Molecular markers and their expression before, during and after treatment, including progesterone B receptor, progesterone A receptor, estrogen receptor, Ki67, PTEN and its related markers, Bcl2 and its related markers and other developing markers. This is to discover prediction markers to medical treatment.
