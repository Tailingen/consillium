Safety and Tolerability of SH-1028 in Patients With Advanced Solid Cancer
This is a Phase 1, open-label study of SH-1028 with dose escalation cohorts in locally advanced solid cancer patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent or standard treatment.
Advanced Solid Cancer
DRUG: SH-1028
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Within the first 28 days of treatment|Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Within the first 28 days of treatment
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of SH-1028, 4 weeks|Elimination half-life(T1/2) of SH-1028, 4 weeks|Maximum (or peak) concentration of SH-1028, 4 weeks|Overall Response Rate, 12 months|Disease control rates（DCR）, 12 months
The study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of once-daily and orally (PO) administered SH-1028 tablets. The overall study design is shown in the flow chart below.
