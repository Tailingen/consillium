Feasibility Study of mFOLFOX6 in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
We performed a feasibility study of mFOLFOX6 in advanced colorectal cancer in Japan and to estimate the safety and efficacy of this regimen.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: l-Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Incidence and severity of adverse event
Determine the clinical response rate, disease-free survival(DFS), overall survival(OS)
A multicenter Open-label, single-arm feasibility study is conducted on patients with histological stage IV colorectal cancer given oxaliplatin, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The usefulness of this regimens as therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival rate (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event.
