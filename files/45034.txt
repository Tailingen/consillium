Colorectal Cancer Screening
OTHER: Community-Based (Intervention Arm)
To assess the feasibility and efficacy of conducting a community-based CRC screening intervention in increasing CRC screening rates, Evaluate feasibility and efficacy of conducting a community-based navigation program for CRC screening. In both arms of the study, we will examine the number of participants provided with health education about colorectal cancer, number of FITs distributed, and number of FITs returned. We will summarize the number of persons screened positive and negative, and determine the proportion of positive screening who are referred to clinical care, and at the Mile Square South Shore and Englewood sites through our community navigation program (intervention) and existing MSHC lay clinical navigation program. We will compare the FIT return rate and average return time at the South Shore and Englewood sites to determine if the rates and times are similar. We will also determine return rates and times for participants who screen positive and are navigated to return the MSHC for diagnostic testing, and make comparisons across the intervention and control arms, 3 years|Evaluate individual-level knowledge related to CRC screening and risk factors, Assess knowledge related to CRC screening and risk factors as measured by our short survey that participants will return with their FIT. We will summarize the frequency and percentage of respondents who have had a prior CRC screening, in addition to the frequency and percentage of respondents who select the correct answers on knowledge questions., 3 years|Characterize individual -level facilitators and barriers to engaging in CRC screening and related diagnostic tests and treatment when applicable, Evaluate facilitators and barriers people living in or near the South Shore communities experience related to CRC screening and related follow-up. We will summarize the respondent responses to survey questions about barriers and facilitators, 3 years
To address the multiple determinants of health that impact CRC screening in the South Shore community in the University of Illinois Cancer Center's catchment area by conducting an experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) tests dispensed by community stakeholders (community-dispensed) versus FIT tests dispensed using standard of care procedures by a clinic dispensed FIT test return rates. This study will follow American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for FIT testing, with the South Shore community area assigned to the intervention group (community-dispensed). CRC screening within the Mile Square Englewood Health Center, using standard of care, will serve as our control group to use for comparison (clinic-dispensed). The intervention will include a multifaceted approach to health education and community engagement focused on CRC led by a team of trusted health champions (community leaders, a barber, a hair salon, and community health workers) in the South Shore community area.
