FOLFOXIRI Plus Panitumumab in Metastatic RAS Wild-type, Left-sided Colorectal Cancer
This is a phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with histologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided RAS WT advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Efficacy/objective response rate, Evaluate the efficacy/objective response rate of the combination of FOLFOXIRI and panitumumab as first-line therapy for metastatic left-sided, RAS WT CRC., Through progression of disease, on average 6 months.
Evaluating progression free survival (PFS), The secondary efficacy endpoints include time to progression and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be calculated for time to progression and overall survival, and medians, along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals, will be reported., Through progression of disease, on average 6 months.|Evaluating overall survival (OS), The secondary efficacy endpoints include time to progression and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be calculated for time to progression and overall survival, and medians, along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals, will be reported., Through progression of disease, on average 6 months.|Evaluating toxicity of this regimen, Subjects will be evaluated for toxicity/safety profile using CTCAE v4, Through progression of disease, on average 6 months.|Evaluating radiographic tumor regression, Subjects will be evaluated for response according to the tumor response measured with RECIST v1.1a, Through progression of disease, on average 6 months.|Evaluating for the velocity of tumor response to this regimen, Exploratory objectives include measuring circulating tumor DNA to assess for clinical response and velocity of response., Patients will be followed until death or 5 years
This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of FOLFOXIRI and panitumumab as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic, left-sided, RAS WT CRC. The research hypothesis is that in this cohort of patients, the combination of triplet chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy will confer higher response rates and efficacy.
