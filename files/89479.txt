Nerve Function in Older Diabetic Patients Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy for Metastatic Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Learning about the side effects of chemotherapy may help plan treatment and may help patients live more comfortably.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying nerve function in older diabetic patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic solid tumors.
Neurotoxicity|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
PROCEDURE: management of therapy complications
Cutaneous sensation as measured by Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment|Gait and balance as measured by Tinetti Performance Oriented Assessment of Gait and Balance Instrument, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment|Vibration as measured by tuning fork, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment|Lower extremity muscle strength as measured by Dynamometer, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment|Blood pressure changes, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment|Glycemic control as measured by Glycosylated Hemoglobin Assay, baseline, every 3 weeks for 4 courses, and then 2 months after completion of study treatment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine changes in peripheral nerve function in older patients with diabetes and metastatic solid tumors treated with taxane or platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.
* Determine the extent to which age, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and level of glycemic control predict a differential pattern in outcome beyond the effect of the drugs in patients treated with these regimens.
* Develop a clinical assessment that would predict whether or not patients with diabetes mellitus are more or less susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy.

OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal study.

Patients undergo an interview and clinical evaluation to measure demographic data, cutaneous sensation, gait and balance, vibration, lower extremity muscle strength, orthostatic blood pressure, and glycemic control. Patients are evaluated at baseline, every 3 weeks during chemotherapy for up to 4 treatments, and at 2 months after completion of treatment.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
