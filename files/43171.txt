This study aims to estimate the effects of nutritional interventions on the improvement of nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) among gastrointestinal patients in Vietnam
Gastric Cancer|Colon Cancer
OTHER: Nutritional counseling
Change of nutritional status after 8 weeks, The Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used as the preeminent interdisciplinary patient assessment among patients with oncology. This tool includes (1) four patient-generated historical components (Weight History, Food Intake, Symptoms, Activities and Function); (2) the professional part (Diagnosis, Metabolic stress, and Physical Exam); (3) the Global Assessment (A = well-nourished, B = moderately malnourished, C = severely malnourished); (4) the total score, and nutritional triage recommendations. Changes in anthropometric indicators were also reported (weight, MUAC, muscle mass), Baseline and 8 weeks|Change of quality of life after 8 weeks: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) version 3.0, We utilized the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) version 3.0, which is an integrated and modular approach to holistically evaluate the QoL of patients with cancer.all dimensions of the tool will range from 0 to 100, in which a higher score presents a better level of functioning/the global health status or a worse level of symptoms., Baseline and 8 weeks
A quasi-experiment with intervention and control groups for pre- and post-intervention assessment was carried out at the Department of Oncology and Palliative Care - Medical University Hospital from 2016 to 2019. 60 gastrointestinal cancer patients were recruited in each group. At stage 1, we selected patients of the intervention group who met the inclusion criteria to receive nutritional counseling and diet at the hospital. At stage 2, we chose patients who were eligible but did not accept the nutritional counseling and diet at the hospital. Participants in both groups were paired together according to the following criteria: 1) Age group: \<40 years old, 40-65 years old and \>65 years old; 2) Gender: Male and female; 3) Types of cancer: stomach cancer and colon cancer; 4) Disease stages: stage 1-2 and stage 3-4.
