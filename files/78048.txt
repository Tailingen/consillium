99mTc-P137 SPECT/CT in Prostate Cancer
Purpose: This study will take prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as the targeting of radionuclide labeled molecular probe to explore the diagnostic efficacy of 99mTc-P137 radioactive probe in prostate cancer. Combining with SPECT/CT to optimize the imaging, image analysis and clinical diagnosis process of 99mTc-P137 probe, the aim of the study is to provide new methods and new means for the early detection, early diagnosis, accurate tumor staging, treatment decision and prognosis judgment of malignant tumor, and will provide scientific and clinical basis for the precise diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

Research objectives: To investigate the clinical translational application value of 99mTc-P137 molecular probe in accurate detection of prostate cancer lesions.

Research design: A prospective study design will be used in this study. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria of this study will be analyzed with 99mTc-P137 SPECT/CT imaging. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of 99mTc-P137 nuclear medicine imaging in accurate detection of prostate cancer lesions, clinical surgical specimens and pathological diagnosis will be used as the gold standard.

Study the population Indications: For patients with suspected prostate cancer who plan to undergo surgical resection or puncture biopsy after various examinations, the final pathological results can be obtained.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: SPECT/CT imaging with 99mTc-P137 nuclide probe
99mTc-P137 SPECT/CT imaging, Qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis (T/N ratio of tumor lesion and adjacent normal tissue, changes in uptake of lesion of interest before and after treatment, and early and late imaging), 2 hours after injection
Other imaging findings, CT, PET/CT, SPECT/CT and MRI will be used to evaluate the lesion scope, size and metastasis of the tumor, 7 days with the injection
