Early Adjuvant Diagnosis of Pulmonary Nodules Based on CTC.
The goal of this observational clinical trial is to evaluate the value of circulating tumor cell detection in the early diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodule. The main questions it aims to answer is: the sensitivity and specificity of peripheral blood circulating tumor cell detection in differentiating benign and malignant pulmonary nodules (â‰¤3cm). Participants will be asked provide 4mL of peripheral blood for the test.
Pulmonary Nodules, Solitary|Pulmonary Nodules, Multiple
sensitivity, the ability of peripheral blood CTC count detection to identify malignant pulmonary nodules when the real condition is malignancy, until the samples are collected and tested as planned, up to 72 months|specificity, the ability of peripheral blood CTC count detection to exclude malignant pulmonary nodules when the real condition is benign disease, until the samples are collected and tested as planned, up to 72 months
The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the value of circulating tumor cell detection in the early diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodule. Patients with clinical suspected malignant pulmonary nodules will be included in this trial. Peripheral blood of participants will be collected before surgery or biopsy. Clinical and imaging data of enrolled patients will also be collected. Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for differentiating benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. The sensitivity and specificity of CTC detection for diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules will be analyzed.
