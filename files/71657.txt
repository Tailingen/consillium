Efficacy of Tomosynthesis in the BIRADS 3 Population
There are three main objectives, centering on those patients targeted for surveillance imaging. The first objective is to compare image quality and specificity of breast tomosynthesis and conventional 2D mammography in a BIRADS 3 diagnostic population. The second objective is to compare image quality and ability to determine post-surgical and post-radiation changes from recurrence in a post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population having undergone conservation therapy (lumpectomy with or without radiation. The final objective is to compare image quality and the ability to determine chemoresponsiveness in a post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population, who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
