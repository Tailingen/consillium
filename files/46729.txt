Study of the Application of CPAP to Reduce Complications and Improve Lung Cancer Ablation Radiofrequency Treatment
The project aims to study whether the application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 4 cm water vapor is a safe method in pulmonary radiofrequency intervention (PRF) lung cancer under conscious sedation compared with placebo. And, assess whether CPAP prevents atelectasis formation and consequently reduces the potential complications of PRF and improves procedural success
Atelectasis|Lung Cancer
DEVICE: RESMED AUTOSET S9
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, Patients with any of the following complications

Pulmonary over-distention along intervention Pneumothorax along intervention Bronchial fistulas measures Computed tomography (CT)1, CT2 and CT3 Vomiting along intervention Decrease in MAP (mean arterial pressure) \> 20% measured in the intraoperative period

Assay of each of the previous complications, thirty days
Prevention of atelectasis., Atelectasic area Normal ventilation pulmonary area Hypoventilation pulmonary area Hyperventilation pulmonary area Bronchial wall injury distance, during surgery|Decrease associated complications with PFR. Measurement times: intraoperative, PACU (post-anesthesic care unit), hospital discharge, day 15 and day 30., Major complications (death, failure to complete treatment, need for manual ventilation, intubation or resuscitation, pulmonary hemorrhage, need for pleural drainage, shock, fistulas, nerve injury, diaphragmatic injury, persistent pain, infections, increased hospitalization time and readmission rates) and any classified as a serious adverse event., thirty days|Treatment success, Tumor ablation range, measured in CT3., Measurement time: CT3|Predictors factors of the occurrence of complications during PRA (pulmonary radiofrequency ablation)., Minor complications (transient episodes of hypoxemia, apnea / hypoventilation or hypotension, pneumothorax without clinic symptoms or drainage, increased need for sedation, longer procedure) and any other event adverse not classified as serious., thirty days
