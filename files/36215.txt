Effect of Modified Endotracheal Intubation Protocol Combined With Early Oral Intake on Postoperative Recovery Quality in Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of modified endotracheal intubation procedure combined with early oral intake on postoperative recovery quality of patients, so as to further optimize the ERAS（enhanced recovery after surgery） program for thyroid or parathyroid surgery.
Thyroid Tumor
BEHAVIORAL: Modified intubation protocol|BEHAVIORAL: Conventional intubation protocol|BEHAVIORAL: Early resumption of oral intake|BEHAVIORAL: Delayed resumption of oral intake
Quality of Recovery-15 score on the first day after surgery, Using Quality of Recovery-15 questionnaire to evaluate the quality of perioperative recovery. Quality of Recovery-15 consists of 15 comprehensive questions, including physical comfort (5 items), psychological support (2 items), physical independence (2 items), emotional state (4 items), and pain (2 items), each item is scored with 0-10 points, 0 represents poor state, 10 represents good state, and the total score is the Quality of Recovery-15 score of the patient., one day
Quality of Recovery-15 score on the day of discharge, Using Quality of Recovery-15 questionnaire to evaluate the quality of perioperative recovery. Quality of Recovery-15 consists of 15 comprehensive questions, including physical comfort (5 items), psychological support (2 items), physical independence (2 items), emotional state (4 items), and pain (2 items), each item is scored with 0-10 points, 0 represents poor state, 10 represents good state, and the total score is the Quality of Recovery-15 score of the patient., one day|Patient satisfaction, Patient satisfaction was assessed based on the postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) scores, with 0 indicating extreme dissatisfaction and 10 indicating very satisfaction., through patient discharge, an average of 2-3 days after surgery|Postoperative pain, The patients were given self-evaluation before resuming oral intake and one day after the surgery. Pharyngeal pain and surgical incision pain were assesed by a visual analogue scale (VAS), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain., one day|Postoperative patient discomfort, The postoperative patient discomfort included the feeling of thirst and hunger. The patients were given self-evaluation before surgery and before resuming oral intake after surgery. The discomfort feelings were assesed by a visual analogue scale (VAS), with 0 indicating no discomfort and 10 indicating the worst discomfort., one day|Intubation time, Time from the end of pre-oxygenation to the completion of intubation and position setted., one day|Endotracheal tube readjustment rate, Rate of endotracheal tube readjustment caused by the lose or weakness of monitor signal during the surgery., one day|Postoperative nausea and vomiting, Researchers recorded the occurences and treatments of postoperative nausea and vomiting., through patient discharge, an average of 2-3 days after surgery|Gastrointestinal recovery time, The first postoperative exhaustion time recorded was considered as gastrointestinal recovery time., through exhaustion after surgery, an average of 1-2 days after surgery|Drainage volume, Total drainage volume after operation., through removal of drainage tube, an average of 2 days after surgery|Postoperative hospital stay length, Postoperative hospital stay length, through patient discharge, an average of 2-3 days after surgery|Adverse event, The occurrence of adverse events such as severe choking, reintubation, postoperative bleeding., through patient discharge, an average of 2-3 days after surgery
After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a screening-period to determine eligibility for study entry. Before operation, patients will be randomly assigned to conventional intubation process group or modified intubation process group before the operation. After the operation, patients will enter the PACU（post-anaesthesia care unit） for further observation. When the anesthesiologists and surgeons agree that patients have no early oral drinking high-risk factors, patients will be randomly assigned to early resumption of oral intake group or late resumption of oral intake group for further observation and evaluation.
