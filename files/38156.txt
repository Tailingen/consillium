Phase II Study of GTx024 in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary efficacy analysis will be the clinical benefit at 6 months as measured by a modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST classification. Key secondary endpoints of objective response rate, progression free survival, time to progression, duration of response, effects on physical function, and effects on tumor progression in women with Androgen Receptor positive breast cancer will also be assessed.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: GTx-024 9mg
Percentage of Subjects Treated With GTx024 With Clinical Benefit With AR Positive Breast Cancer, N=17 of 22 subjects with AR Positive Breast Cancer - Clinical Benefit is defined as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., 6 months
Percentage of Subjects Treated With GTx024 With Clinical Benefit (All Subjects), Clinical Benefit is defined as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., 6 Months|Percentage of Subjects Treated With GTx024 Achieving Objective Response by 1 Year of Treatment, Objective Response is defined as achieving Complete or Partial Response on Tumor Assessments

Note: Due to zero subject achieving response, all subsequent outcome measures related to response cannot be conducted., 1 Year
This is an open label, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of GTx-024 in female subjects who have estrogen receptor (ER) positive metastatic breast cancer and who have responded previously to hormone therapy. Subjects may have received up to 3 prior hormonal therapies for the treatment of breast cancer. Subjects must have responded to adjuvant hormonal therapy for \> 3 years or hormonal therapy for metastatic disease for \> 6 months before progression to be eligible for this study.

The primary efficacy analysis will be the clinical benefit in subjects with AR positive breast cancer at 6 months as measured by a modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) classification. Key secondary endpoints of clinical benefit in all subjects and AR negative subjects, as well as objective response rate, progression free survival, time to progression, duration of response, incidence of SREs, and time to first SRE in subsets based on AR status will also be assessed.
