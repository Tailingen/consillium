CLAG Gleevec in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of the study is to find out what effects (good and bad) Gleevec® (Imatinib mesylate) combined with chemotherapy has on participants and their acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: CLAG Regimen|DRUG: Gleevec®
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate: Morphologic Complete Remission (CR) + Morphologic Complete Remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) for evaluable participants. CR - Bone Marrow: \< 5% blasts without Auer rods with at least 20% cellularity with maturation of all cell lines, No presence of unique phenotype by flow cytometry identical to what was found in the pretreatment specimen, No persistent dysplasia; Peripheral: normal blood counts, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1.0 k/μl and platelets \> 100 k/μl ANC \> 1.0 k/μl and platelets \> 100 k/μl (Peripheral blood counts documenting recovery can be utilized within 4 weeks of the bone marrow); No evidence of extramedullary leukemia. CRi - All CR criteria are met except for residual Neutropenia \<1.0 x 10\^9/L platelets \< 100 k/μl., 8 weeks per participant
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Leukemia related failure (progressive disease): Failure to induce bone marrow hypoplasia after 2 cycles or regrowth of leukemic blasts ≥ 20%., Up to 3 years|Median Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Up to 3 years
In relapsed or resistant acute myeloid leukemia (a type of blood cancer where immature blood cells are increased, blocking normal blood cell production), different types of chemotherapy are used for treatment. Patients responded to all the chemotherapies in similar ways, but most of the responses did not last long if further stem cell transplantation was not done. Gleevec is believed to work by interfering with the abnormal protein by blocking it from telling the body to keep making more white blood cells that are abnormal.

The CLAG regimen is the standard chemotherapy used for relapsed AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). This study will add Gleevec® to the regimen for a period of 14 days. Gleevec® is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its use in combination with CLAG regimen is considered experimental for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia/CML blast crisis.
