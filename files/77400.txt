Nuevo Amanecer II: Translating a Stress Management Program for Latinas
The primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of the Nuevo Amanecer-II (NA-II) cognitive-behavioral stress management program through a 6-month RCT with 150 Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer in three rural settings in terms of improving quality of life (QoL) and reducing distress, compared to a usual care control group (that is offered the program at the end of the 6 months). The investigators will also test the effects of the program on biomarkers of stress (hair and saliva cortisol) and aging (telomere length from saliva). Trained Latinas, called Compa√±eras (Companions), who have had breast cancer deliver the stress management program in-person to Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer.

All saliva samples will then be picked up by San Francisco State University Health Equity Research Laboratory (HER) staff to process to extract DNA and measure telomeres., Baseline and 6 month assessment|Change in diurnal cortisol rhythm to assess regulatory patterns through saliva samples collected over 3 days, 3 times/day., Participants will collect nine saliva samples pre-invention (baseline) and at the 6-month follow-up. The first two samples will be taken within the first half hour of waking (first upon awakening and 30 minutes after waking). Participants will collect the last sample right before they go to bed. All saliva samples will then be picked up by San Francisco State University Health Equity Research Laboratory (HER) staff for cortisol characterization., Baseline and 6 month assessment
The purpose of this study is to adapt Nuevo Amanecer (NA-I) for use in rural populations and test the effects of the new adapted program, NA-II, in a 6-month RCT among 150 rural, low literacy Latinas with non-metastatic breast cancer. Primary outcomes will consist of quality of life and distress. In an ancillary study, the investigators will compare the intervention and wait-list control groups on biomarkers of stress (hair and saliva cortisol) and aging (telomere length from saliva). Finally, to facilitate statewide dissemination of Nuevo Amanecer-II (NA-II), the investigators will develop a guide to implementation for community-based organizations.

The investigators will adapt NA-I to be appropriate for rural and low-literacy Latinas with breast cancer. Needed program adaptations will be identified through a formative evaluation consisting of semi-structured interviews with key informants (e.g., rural Latina breast cancer survivors, advocates, health care providers) and iterative consultations with community representatives in three rural areas with large Latino populations. Results will be applied by the study team and community advisors to adapt NA-I to create NA-II and create the implementation guide.

The investigators will identify key individual, organizational, and community factors that facilitate implementation and support scalability and statewide dissemination through a process evaluation where the investigators will track key implementation activities and debrief program participants, interventionists, and advocates. Products will include NA-II interventionist and participant manuals and a guide to implementation for organizations seeking to replicate the program.
