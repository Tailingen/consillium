Understanding Low Gynecological Cancer Delay and Help-seeking Behavior in Older Patients.
Systematic screening for cervical cancer stops in France at 65 years old. The incidence of certain types of gynecological neoplasia increases with age (endometrium, vulva). Diagnosis delay of 8 months has been described for uterine cancer and longer delays for vulvar cancer.

The aim of our study is to understand help-seeking behavior and its delay for this type of cancer among patients older than 65.
