Clinical Trial of Intravenous Alvespimycin in Patients With Her2 Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity (via objective response rate) of alvespimycin in patients with breast cancer who have not previously received trastuzumab (except as adjuvant therapy).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Alvespimycin
Objective tumor response rate (either RECIST or WHO complete response, partial response or minor response) confirmed by CT and MRI as the preferred methods for tumor assessments and Chest x-ray is acceptable for pulmonary lesions, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)
Adverse Events assessed according to the NCI CTCAE (v 3.0) grading system, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment, and for 167 days|Laboratory tests assessed according to the NCI CTCAE (v 3.0) grading system, Within 10 days prior to Cycle 1/1st infusion; within 48 hours of infusion (Cycle 1/Weeks 2/3/4 and Cycle 2+/Week3), or within 72 hours prior to infusion (Cycle 2+/Week 1)|Vital signs, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment, Day1 of Weeks 1, 2, and 3 of Cycle 1 (4 weeks long), and prior to each 4-week cycle starting with Cycle 2, for 167 days|Karnofsky Performance Status, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment, prior to each 4-week cycle starting with Cycle 2, for 167 days|Ocular testing, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment, Cycle 1/Day 10 (3 days +/- 1 day following the 2nd infusion in the first cycle of therapy), prior to Cycle 2, if clinically indicated thereafter, for 167 days|Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to progression, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Time to progression on the patient's prior cytotoxic chemotherapy compared to the patient's time to progression on alvespimycin, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to response, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Kaplan-Meier estimate of duration of response, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to treatment failure, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival, (all patients were off study by June 2008), Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment with tumor assessments reevaluated every 8 weeks (+/- 4 days)|Changes in tumor markers, Within 28 days prior to the start of treatment, Prior to each 4-week cycle starting with Cycle 2, for 167 days|Histopathological and molecular profile of responding and non-responding patients using paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, Specimens were obtained within 28 days prior to the start of treatment
