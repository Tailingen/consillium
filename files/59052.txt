Sorafenib and Radioembolization With Sir-Spheres速 for the Treatment of Metastatic Ocular Melanoma
The best way to combine a loco-regional procedure such as chemoembolisation or radioembolization combined with an anti-angiogenic drug is not clear. This phase I trial aims to establish, first, the tolerability of the combination of liver radioembolization with SirSpheres速 and sorafenib in uveal melanoma patients with liver metastasis studying different schedules of administration of sorafenib after and before radioembolization. Secondly, we aim to evaluate angiogenic markers modifications during these different schedules, either in the serum or radiologicaly. Dose of Sorafenib will be 400 mg BID and the timing of introduction will differ for one cohort to the other, given after the radioembolization for initials cohorts and finally, before and concomitantly to radioembolization for the last cohort.
Ocular Melanoma
DRUG: Sorafenib|DEVICE: Radioembolization with SIR-Spheres速 (Yttrium Microspheres)
Toxicity, Toxicities will be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0)., 30 days of treatment of sorafenib
Translational research on biomarkers, Measurement of angiogenic factors and evaluation of angiogenesis with dynamic micro-bubble contrast-enhanced US, 2 years|Clinical benefit, Clinical benefit (CR, PR and NC) evaluated with 18F-FDG-PET CT scan and CT scan by using respectively PERCIST criteria and RECIST criteria, 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), 2 years|Overall survival (OS), 2 years
Primary objective:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib in combination with SIR-Spheres速 radioembolization in uveal melanoma patients metastatic to the liver.

Secondary objectives:

* Translational research on biomarkers (blood and liver biopsies) as well as on radiological exam by using microbubble contrast enhanced ultrasound. Angiogenic markers such as VEGF, IGF-2, TFG Angiopoietin-2 and IL-8 will be monitored. Correlations will be investigated between the angiogenic markers (blood \& tumor tissue), angiogenic radiological exam and the response to the treatment.
* To evaluate the response, clinical benefit, PFS and survival of the patients.
