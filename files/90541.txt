A Prospective, Single Arm, Open Label, Phase II Clinical Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Ivonescimab (AK112) Combined With TAS-102 in the Treatment of Refractory MSS/pMMR Advanced Colorectal Cancer

Main purpose:

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of Ivonescimab (AK112) and TAS-102 in the treatment of refractory MSS/pMMR advanced colorectal cancer

Exploratory purpose:

Evaluation of the relationship between immune markers, patient efficacy, and prognosis in the treatment of refractory MSS/pMMR advanced colorectal cancer with the combination of Ivonescimab (AK112) and TAS-102 Study endpoint

Primary endpoint:

Researchers evaluated the PFS rate at 18 weeks based on RECIST v1.1.

Secondary endpoint:

ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS evaluated based on RECIST v1.1. The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)
MSS/pMMR Type Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Patients
DRUG: Ivonescimab,TAS-102
PFS rate at 18 weeks, The progression free survival rate (PFS) at 18 weeks refers to the proportion of patients who have experienced objective deterioration or progression (including death) of the disease for the first time since the start of treatment, and whose survival time has reached or exceeded 18 weeks, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)
Overall response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a response of CR or PR, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall survival (OS), From the date of randomization until the date of death, From date of randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years
