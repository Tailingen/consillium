Observation for Patients With Asymptomatic CNS Metastatic Disease
The purpose of this registry is to determine if select patients with CNS metastatic disease can be safely observed rather than treated. The investigators hypothesize that there is a subset of patients with small asymptomatic CNS mets that do not require treatment, these patients can simply be observed and will not have CNS progression.

OTHER: Observation
Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, Every two months for two years|CNS treatment-free survival rate, overall survival combined with CNS treatment, Every two months for two years
Quality of life, determined by FACT-Br, Every two months for two years|Natural History of untreated CNS met, Measure the size of CNS target lesion over time, Every two months for two years|Type of treatment, When/if needed, Every two months for two years|Indication for treatment, when/if treatment is needed due to discontinuation of observation. Classified between: increase in size to \>1cm; interval growth of 0.4 cm in 6-8 weeks; development of edema or increase in edema; development of symptoms; or patient preference., Every two months for two years|Neurocognitive testing, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Every two months for two years
Subjects will be given a consultation with physician investigators in the department of one of the study investigators, who will introduce the study if the subject is potentially eligible.

Information collected at initial assessment:

* Quality of life survey (FACT-Br)
* History and Physical exam (to include KPS, disease status on most recent non-CNS imaging, chemotherapy history, age).
* Measurement of walking pace: patient will walk a pre- measured 6 meters, patient is to be instructed to walk at a normal pace. The time required to travel this distance will be recorded. For patients that are wheelchair bound or otherwise immobile, the pace will be recorded as '0'.
* Neurocognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)
* MRI scan with contrast (must be within 6 weeks)

Observation and Follow-up Visits:

* Patients will be seen at 6 weeks and then every 2 months for follow-up (with physical exam) with repeat MRI with contrast at that time
* FACT-Br survey to be filled out at each follow-up
* Neurocognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)

Treatment for Progression:

* Progression is defined as: Increase in size to \> 1 cm (\> 2.0 for patients being treated with targeted therapy); Interval growth of 0.4 cm in 6-8 weeks; Development of edema or increase in edema; Development of symptoms from CNS lesion; Patient preference
* Patients that meet criteria for treatment will be treated at discretion of treating physician; options can include whole brain radiation, radiosurgery, surgery.

The study does not provide financial or other compensation to subjects
