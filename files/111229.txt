Reconstructive Surgery For Head And Neck Cancer Patients
The goal of this study is to better understand the changes in symptoms and overall quality of life after head and neck surgery and reconstruction. "Quality of Life" means how you feel about your life as a result of your disease and its treatment. Learning about changes in patients' quality of life will help doctors and future patients make more informed treatment decisions.
Advanced Stage Head and Neck Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Quality of Life Questionaires & Interview: EORTC QLQ C-30, EORTC QLQ H&N-35, Health Behaviors, Subjective Significance Questionnaire, Qualitative Assessment
To describe overall pt-reported health-related QOL and cancer related symptoms pre-operatively and at 3, 6 and 9 mos following surgical resection and reconstruction for head & neck malignancies, 1 year
To describe changes in patient-reported health-related quality of life and cancer-related symptoms within 9 or 12 months following surgical resection and reconstruction., 2 years
This prospective, longitudinal study will evaluate patient-reported quality of life and symptomatology immediately prior to and for up to one year following surgical resection and reconstruction head and neck malignancies.Patients with head and neck malignancies that require simultaneous surgical resection and reconstruction of the ablative defect will be eligible to participate.Quality of life and symptom relief will be evaluated by both domain and disease specific questionnaires at four time points: pre-operatively, and 3 months (±1 month), 6 months (±1), and 9 months (-1 and +3) post-operatively. These assessment points represent clinically significant events in patients' post-operative course following head and neck surgery. Studies have shown that quality of life decreases significantly at three months after surgery but then reapproaches baseline levels around one year (1). Pre-operative responses will serve as the baseline for comparison.
