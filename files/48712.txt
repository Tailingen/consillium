Increasing Physical Activity of Patients With Head and Neck Cancer (I-PAP Study)
Generally, patients who have undergone treatments for Head Neck Cancer have a decreased quality of life and experience depression and fatigue. Regular physical activity improves emotional well-being, increases immunological response, improves wound healing, lessens fatigue and improves general functionality and quality of life.

This study will determine effectiveness of the 12-week exercise intervention program, determine if physically active patients differ in quality of life, depression and fatigue during the course of the study, and determine if the change in physical activity levels is related to changes in immune responses.
Head and Neck Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Intervention group
Self-report of physical activity behavior (duration, intensity and frequency), Participants will be taught how to keep the Activity diary to record walking and physical activities., Baseline and Post Intervention
Plasma IL-6 Concentration, 5ml of blood will be collected from each blood draw at baseline and post-intervention to assay for Interleukin-6 level., Baseline and Post Intervention
The general hypothesis of this research is that patients who have undergone treatments for Head Neck Cancer have a decreased quality of life and experience depression and fatigue. Increasing and sustaining physical activity of these patients will improve their emotional well-beings, increase their immunological response, improve wound healing, lessen fatigue and improve their general functionality and quality of life.

The purposes of this study are to: (1) determine the effectiveness of the 12-week exercise intervention program in increasing physical activity in head and neck cancer patients; (2) determine if physically active patients differ in quality of life, depression and fatigue during the course of the study; and (3) determine if the change in physical activity levels is related to changes in the immune responses in human.
