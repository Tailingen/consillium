Prostate Cancer Metastatic
PROCEDURE: Radical prostatectomy plus standard care|DRUG: Standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer
the time to castrate resistance, The time to treatment failure defined as castrate resistance will be recorded via routine patient follow-up interviews., 36 months after randomization
Quality of life in patients post-randomization, EuroQOL 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire will be used to assess quality of life in patients after randomization with different treatments. This is designed to measure health-related quality of life. It consists of a questionnaire and a visual analogue scale. The subjects in 5 dimensions i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression are asked to grade their own current level of function in each dimension into one of five levels of disability (i.e. I have no problems waling about, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or unable to walk). This tool also has an overall health scale where the rater selects a number between 1-100 to describe the condition of their health, 100 being the best imaginable., three month post randomization
In this study, patients with oligo-metastatic prostate cancer will be randomized to radical prostatectomy plus standard care and standard care only. Standard care refers to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) +/- other systemic therapies. Time to disease progression and post-treatment quality of life will be assessed and compared.
