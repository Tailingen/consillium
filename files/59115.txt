MOHs Surgery and Short-Course Radiation Therapy With Structured Follow-Up for Head & Neck Squamous Cell Skin Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate if short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) can effectively treat high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and if active surveillance is a safe alternative to radiation for moderate-risk cSCC in adults with head and neck cSCC who have undergone surgery.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does short-course radiation therapy (5 treatments over 2 weeks) effectively prevent cancer recurrence in high-risk patients? Can moderate-risk patients be safely monitored with active surveillance instead of receiving radiation?

Researchers will compare:

Short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) for high-risk patients to historical data on long-course radiation to determine effectiveness.

Active surveillance for moderate-risk patients to expected recurrence rates to assess safety.

Participants will:

High-Risk Group (SCRT): Receive short-course radiation therapy and attend follow-up visits.

Moderate-Risk Group (Active Surveillance): Have regular check-ups, including clinical exams and imaging, to monitor for cancer recurrence.

Optionally provide blood samples for future biomarker research.

This clinical trial investigates two approaches for managing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck following surgical resection, based on patient risk stratification. The study evaluates short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) as a treatment for high-risk cSCC and active surveillance as a potential alternative to radiation therapy for moderate-risk cSCC.

High-Risk Cohort (Short-Course Radiation Therapy - SCRT) Patients classified as high risk will undergo SCRT, consisting of five fractions of radiation therapy over a two-week period. This approach aims to provide effective local control while minimizing treatment burden compared to conventional long-course radiation therapy (typically 30+ fractions over six weeks). The study will assess the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of SCRT, including recurrence rates, toxicity profiles, and patient-reported quality of life.

Moderate-Risk Cohort (Active Surveillance) Patients meeting moderate-risk criteria will not receive adjuvant radiation therapy but will instead be monitored through regular clinical exams and imaging. This arm evaluates whether active surveillance is a safe alternative to radiation in this population by tracking recurrence rates and overall survival.

Study Design and Assessments Participants will be followed for oncologic outcomes (local, regional, and distant recurrence rates), adverse events, functional outcomes, and patient-reported quality of life. Optional blood sample collection will allow for biomarker analysis and potential future translational research.

By stratifying patients based on risk, this trial aims to refine post-surgical management of head and neck cSCC, potentially reducing unnecessary radiation exposure in moderate-risk patients while ensuring effective treatment for high-risk individuals.
