Phase 2a Study to Evaluate Suppression of 5-Fluorouracil -Induced Mucositis by TK112690
Patients expected to receive a 500 mg/m2 of Leucovorin by iv \& 500 mg/m2 of Fluorouracil (5FU) by iv bolus for their Colorectal Cancer. The patients will receive a one-hour infusion of TK-90 or equivalent TK-90 placebo depending on randomization at 5 hours \& 11 hours post 5-FU iv bolus. This treatment cycle will continue weekly for 6 weeks. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.
Mucositis
DRUG: TK-112690|DRUG: Placebo
Mucositis, SOM (Severe Oral Mucositis) - Comparison of incidences of Grade 3 or 4 mucositis (WHO scale) in the treatment and placebo groups.

Duration of SOM. Days patients suffer Grades 3 and 4 oral mucositis measured by WHO scale from the start of treatment. number of days from the first occurrence of WHO Grade 3 or 4 OM through the first occurrence of non-severe (≤ Grade 2) without a subsequent instance of ≥ Grade 3 OM. Subjects with complete study follow-up for severe OM who do not develop severe OM (grade 0-2) will be considered to have durations of 0 days, 8 Weeks
Secondary efficacy/outcome mucositis, A) In addition to the WHO scale, mucositis status in the patients will also be evaluated using two different published and validated mucositis scales: NCI/CTCAE/mucositis, and PROMS.

B) Comparison of WHO scale values of treated patients at each point of evaluation., 8 Weeks
Patients expected to receive a 500 mg/m2 of Leucovorin by iv \& 500 mg/m2 of Fluorouracil (5FU) by iv bolus for their Colorectal Cancer. The patients will receive a one-hour infusion of TK-90 or equivalent TK-90 placebo depending on randomization at 5 hours \& 11 hours post 5-FU iv bolus. This treatment cycle will continue weekly for 6 weeks. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.

* 24 patients will be randomized equally into 2 different groups: TK-90 treated or TK-90 placebo treated.
* Screening must be completed within 2 weeks.
* The treatment period for the study is 6 weeks.
* Study follow-up will be scheduled post two weeks of completion of last dose of Chemotherapy \& TK-90
* Blinding: The study will be partially blinded. The patient and investigator as well as site personnel will be blinded as to whether TK-90 or TK-90 placebo is administered. The CRO, sponsor, and site pharmacist will know whether the patient was administered active drug or TK-90 placebo
