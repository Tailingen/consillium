An Efficacy and Safety Study of Fedratinib Compared to Best Available Therapy in Subjects With DIPSS-intermediate or High-risk Primary Myelofibrosis, Post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, or Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis and Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib
A Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fedratinib compared to best available therapy (BAT) in subjects with DIPSS (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System)-intermediate or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) and previously treated with ruxolitinib. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the percentage of subjects with at least 35% spleen volume reduction in the fedratinib and the BAT arms.

DRUG: FEDRATINIB|DRUG: Best Available Therapy (BAT)
Spleen Volume Response Rate (RR), Percentage of participants who have ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction (SVR) at end of cycle 6

A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to adjust for planned stratification factors (spleen size by palpation, platelet counts and refractory/relapsed or intolerance to ruxolitinib treatment).

The RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be provided for each arm as well as for the difference in RRs and 95% confidence interval of the difference for fedratinib to BAT., From Screening to end of Cycle 6 (1 cycle = 28 days), approximately 196 days
Symptom Response Rate (SRR), Percentage of participants with ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom scores measured by Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) 4.0 at end of cycle 6.

Subjects with a missing TSS at the end of cycle 6 or who had disease progression before the end of the cycle 6 will be considered non-responders.

MFSAF measures the sum of 7 symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being absent and 10 being the worst imagineable). The lower the score the better.

Participants with a missing spleen size assessment at the end of cycle 6 including those who meet the criteria for progression of splenomegaly before end of cycle 6 will be considered not to be responders., From Cycle 1 Dose 1 to end of Cycle 6, approximately 168 days|Durability of Spleen Volume Response (DR), Durability of spleen volume response (DR) by MRI/CT is defined as the date from the first documented spleen response (ie, ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume) to the date of subsequent progressive disease (PD) in spleen volume per the IWG-MRT 2013 criteria or death, whichever is earlier. In the absence of an event before the analysis is performed, the DR will be censored at the date of the last valid assessment performed before the analysis performed date., From baseline to end of treatment visit, Approximately on average 53 weeks up to 151 weeks.|Durability of Spleen Response by Palpation (DRP), Durability of spleen response by palpation (DRP) is defined as time from the date of the first documented palpable spleen response, according to the IWG-MRT 2013 to the date of the subsequent PD in spleen size according to the IWG-MRT 2013 or death, whichever is earlier. Durability of spleen response by palpation according to the IWG-MRT 2013 criteria will be calculated for subjects that have an enlarged spleen at baseline (≥ 5 cm below LCM), and that have a spleen response by palpation.
