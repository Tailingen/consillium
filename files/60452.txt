Glioblastoma Platelet Activation Study
Glioblastoma face an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Furthermore, the most frequent immune cells in glioblastoma are tumor associated macrophages, which find theirself in an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype.

Increased conjugates between circulating platelets and monocytes reflect an pro-inflammatory status.
