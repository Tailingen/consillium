Mifamurtide Combined With Post-operative Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed High Risk Osteosarcoma Patients
Trial evaluating the impact on efficacy of mifamurtide as add-on treatment to post-operative chemotherapy compared to post-operative chemotherapy alone in first-line treatment of patients with high-risk osteosarcoma (defined as metastatic osteosarcoma at diagnosis or localised osteosarcoma with poor histological response).
Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Mifamurtide|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: EI or M-API regimen depending on patient age
Compare event-free survival in the treatment arms, Event-free survival defined as the time duration from randomisation to time of first event (loco-regional or distant relapse or progression, second malignancy, death from any cause), Expected average duration of 3 years from randomization
Compare overall survival in the treatment arms, Overall survival defined as the time duration from randomisation to death, whatever the cause of death, Up to 10 years from randomization|Compare actual and planned cumulative dose and dose intensity of mifamurtide, Calculation of actual cumulative dose and dose intensity compared to the planned treatment administration schedule, Up to 36 weeks from randomization (until end of treatment)|Compare the incidence of adverse events in the treatment arms, Evaluation of toxicity (graded by NCI-CTCAE v4), Up to 40 weeks from randomization (4 weeks after end of treatment)
Multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase II trial, with 2 parallel groups. After pre-operative chemotherapy and surgery of the primary tumour and lung metastases (if applicable), patients presenting high-risk osteosarcoma (defined as metastatic osteosarcoma at diagnosis or localised osteosarcoma with poor histological response) will be randomised between 2 arms:

* Control arm: post-operative chemotherapy alone (with regimens adapted to the age of patient)
* Experimental arm : post-operative chemotherapy combined with mifamurtide

This randomised trial is part of a study recruiting all patients â‰¤50 years old with a newly diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma.
