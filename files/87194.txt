Evaluation of Salivary RNAs in the Presence of an Adnexal Mass of Ovarian Origin
OVAmiARN is a multicentre, prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional, observational study carried out in 8 obstetrics and gynecology departments in France; in order to describe the evolution of salivary miRNA expression between the pre-operative and post-therapy visits according to the type of mass. In time, the clinical application will be to significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and improve the care pathway for ovarian adnexal mass.

The study population consists of patients with an ovarian adnexal mass diagnosed by clinical examination and imaging (pelvic ultrasound and/or MRI) and requiring surgical management in routine care.

The patients concerned by the study will be managed without modification of the care pathway, nor modification of the therapeutic indications, nor modification of the diagnostic or follow-up examinations (imaging or biology) necessary according to the context, which are carried out according to the recommendations of the HAS, CNGOF.

In this study, the management and follow-up of patients :

* Are not imposed by the study: the doctor remains free to make medical prescriptions (treatments and examinations) and to determine the interval between consultation visits,
* Are not modified in comparison with the usual follow-up, except for the performance of the Collection of saliva
