Complete Clinical Responders to Definite Chemoradiation in Esophageal Cancer : a Survival Analysis
The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors for outcome in patients being complete clinical responders with chemoradiation or radiation for esophageal cancer
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Identification of prognostic factors for overall survival, Correlation between survival and baseline,clinical and treatment characteristics, From date of treatment until death, assessed up to 10 years
Patterns of treatment failure, Type of recurrence : local, regional, distant., From date of treatment until treatment failure, assessed up to 10 years|Disease-free survival, Time between the end of treatment and the occurence of progression, From date of treatment until progression or death, assessed up to 10 years
