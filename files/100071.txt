A Study of Bispecific Antibody MCLA-145 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies
This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of MCLA-145 in adult patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors or B-cell lymphomas. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.
Advanced Cancer|Solid Tumor, Adult|B-cell Lymphoma, Adult
DRUG: MCLA-145|DRUG: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicities, first 28 days of treatment|Number of patients with Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, up to 90 days post-last dose
Overall response rate (ORR), Every 8 to 12 weeks until study ends, approximately 4 years|Duration of response ( DOR), Every 8 to 12 weeks until study ends, approximately 4 years|Disease control rate ( DCR), Every 8 to 12 weeks until study ends, approximately 4 years|Progression Free Survival ( PFS), Every 8 to 12 weeks until study ends, approximately 4 years|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies against MCLA-145, 12 months|Peak plasma concentration [Cmax], 12 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC], 12 months|Half-life [t1/2], 12 months
Study Design: This open label, multicenter, first in human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation to find the recommended dose of MCLA-145 in monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab.

Part 2 is a dose expansion to confirm the dose of MCLA-145, alone or in combination through further evaluation of safety, tolerability, Pk, preliminary antitumor activity, and functional target engagement.

The study includes three periods: Screening (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); Treatment (first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days for patients treated Q2W and 21 days for patients treated Q3W); Safety Follow-up (30 and 90 days after the last dose) including survival follow-up checks every 2 months up to 12 months after the last dose.
