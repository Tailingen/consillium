Use of a Proliferation Saturation Index to Determine Personalized Radiotherapy for HPV + Oropharyngeal Cancers
This study is to determine whether a mathematical model can be used to choose a radiation delivery method to improve the rate of a rapid response.
Oropharyngeal Cancer
RADIATION: Radiotherapy fractionation
Percentage of Response at Week 4 of Treatment, Fractionation of radiation will be individualized based on patient Proliferation Saturation Index (PSI). Objective is to increase the rate of response of ≥ 32% at 4 weeks to 63% of patients, above the expected 49%. Result is reported as percentage of participants who met the criteria for ≥ 32% reduction in tumor volume by week 4., At 4 weeks of treatment
Rate of Complete Response at 2-3 Months, Rate of complete response by Computed Tomography (CT) at 2 months or Positron Emission Topography (PET)/CT at 3 months following completion of therapy, 2-3 months post treatment
Investigators hypothesize that using individual patient proliferation saturation index (PSI) to select radiotherapy fractionation (conventional fractionation or hyperfractionation) may improve the likelihood of a rapid response (defined as ≥ 32% reduction in volume at 4 weeks).
