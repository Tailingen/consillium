Treg Cells for AGVHD in Non-myeloablative UCB Transplant
This is a Simon's optimal two-stage phase II trial designed to estimate grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after infusion of T regulatory (nTreg) in a fixed dose ratio to the combined CD3+ cell count of the two graft units in recipients of double UCB transplantation. The nTreg cells (manufactured from a 3rd cord blood unit) are infused on day 0 at least 1 hour after the 2nd unit of the double umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant.

The nTreg cells require an 18 day (±2 days) lead time based on the planned transplant day. The combined CD3+ cell content from the two graft UCB units is enumerated upon thaw (day 0). The patient then receives the number of nTregs cells from the 3rd cord product to achieve a Treg:CD3+ cells ratio of 5:1. The nTreg cell dose depends on the CD3+ cell content of the two graft UCB graft units, but it will not exceed the highest dose level safely tested in the ongoing University of Minnesota phase I Treg dose escalation study MT 2006-01.
Hematologic Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: T Regulatory cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|RADIATION: Total Body Irradiation
Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease, Determine if 3:1 ratio of Treg:CD3+ cells reduces the risk grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease of 20% by day 100 as compared to patients with hematological malignancy receiving same conditioning regimen and immunosuppression but no Tregs., Day +100
Incidence of double and single unit chimerism, Compare the incidence of double and single unit chimerism at day +100 between Treg and controls, Day +100|Incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease, Compare the incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD between Treg and controls, Day +100|Incidence of viral and fungal infections, Compare the incidence of viral and fungal infections at 1 year between Treg and controls, 1 year|Survival, Compare the probability of survival at 1 year between Treg and controls, 1 year|Incidence of neutrophil recovery, Compare the incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 42 between Treg and controls, Day 42|Incidence of treatment related mortality, Determine the incidence of treatment related mortality (TRM) at 6 months between Treg and controls, 6 months|Incidence of platelet recovery, Compare the incidence of platelet recovery at 1 year between Treg and controls, 1 year|Incidence of chronic GVHD, Compare the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year between Treg and controls, 1 year|Incidence of relapse, Compare the incidence of relapse at 1 year between Treg and controls, 1 year
