Progression Free Survival (PFS) Using Investigator Assessment According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), To determine the efficacy by progression free survival (PFS) using investigator assessment according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1) of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy., Radiologic scans performed at baseline then every 12 weeks up to 156 weeks, then every 24 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression. DCO: 17 May 2018
Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Overall Survival, To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of overall survival (OS). Reports results of a pre-specified interim analysis; results for final OS analysis (235 OS events) anticipated 2029., Assessed every 4 weeks until treatment discontinues (up to a max of 156 weeks), then as per protocol. Analysis performed with DCO: 17May2018. Further analyses will be performed at 7 years (descriptive), after 206 events and after 60% maturity.|Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Time to Earliest Progression by RECIST or Cancer Antigen (CA-125) or Death, To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time to earliest progression by RECIST or Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) or death, CA-125 performed at baseline + every 4 weeks. Radiologic scans performed at baseline + every 12 weeks up to 156 weeks, then every 24 weeks until objective radiological disease progression. DCO:17May2018|Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Time From Randomization to Second Progression, To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomisation to second progression (PFS2), Following first progression disease then assessed per local practice every 12 weeks until second progression.|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O), To compare the effects of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by the trial outcome index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O) in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy. The TOI ranges from 0-100 and a higher score indicates a higher HRQoL., Questionnaires will be given to the patient at baseline, at Day 29 and then every 12 weeks for 156 weeks, then every 24 weeks or until the data cut off for the PFS analysis, change in TOI over 24 months reported|Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Time to First Subsequent Therapy or Death (TFST), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomisation to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST). Reports results of a pre-specified interim analysis; final analysis results will later be added at time of final OS analysis (anticipated 2029)., Assessed every 12 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Analysis performed with DCO: 17May2018. Further analyses will be performed at 7 years (descriptive), after 206 events and after 60% maturity.|Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Time to Second Subsequent Therapy or Death (TSST), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomisation to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST). Reports results of a pre-specified interim analysis; final analysis results will later be added at time of final OS analysis (anticipated 2029)., Assessed every 12 weeks following treatment discontinuation. Analysis performed with DCO: 17May2018. Further analyses will be performed at 7 years (descriptive), after 206 events and after 60% maturity.|Efficacy in Patients Following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy by Assessment of Time From Randomization to Study Treatment Discontinuation or Death (TDT), To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical complete response or partial response following first line platinum based chemotherapy by assessment of time from randomisation to study treatment discontinuation or death (TDT). Reports results of a pre-specified interim analysis; final analysis results will later be added at time of final OS analysis (anticipated 2029)., Time elapsed from randomization to study treatment discontinuation or death. Analysis performed with DCO: 17May2018. Further analyses will be performed at 7 years (descriptive), after 206 events and after 60% maturity.|Efficacy in Patients With a Deleterious or Suspected Deleterious Variant in Either of the BRCA Genes by Assessment of PFS, To assess efficacy of olaparib in patients identified as having a deleterious or suspected deleterious variant in either of the BRCA genes using variants identified with current and potential future BRCA mutation assays (gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis), Radiologic scans performed at baseline then every 12 weeks for the first 156 weeks, then every 24 weeks thereafter, assessed until disease progression. Analysis of data assessed up to a maximum of 54 months.
A Phase III, Randomised, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Multicentre Study of Olaparib Maintenance Monotherapy in Patients with BRCA Mutated Advanced (FIGO Stage III-IV) Ovarian Cancer following First Line Platinum Based Chemotherapy.
