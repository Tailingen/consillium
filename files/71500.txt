A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of KQB198 as Monotherapy and in Combination in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if KQB198 works to treat advanced solid tumor cancer in adults. It will also learn about the safety of KQB198. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the safe dose of KQB198 by itself or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs?
* Does KQB198 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs decrease the size of the tumor?
* What happens to KQB198 in the body?

Participants will:

* Take KQB198 daily, alone or in combination with another anti-cancer drug
* Visit the clinic about 8 times in the first 8 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks after that
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: KQB198|DRUG: osimertinib
Number of patients who experience treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and dose-limiting toxicities (Part 1), Safety characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment of AEs, SAEs, and DLTs, from first dose of study treatment to 28 days after last dose of study treatment., 28 Days|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (Part 1), Evaluate safety and assess number of patients with dose-limiting toxicity to determine the RP2D., up to 30 months|Efficacy and Optimal Biologic Dose of study treatment, as measured by Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Parts 2 and 3), Objective response is the proportion of subjects that experience confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1 during the time period from 1st dose of study treatment until last dose., up to 30 months
