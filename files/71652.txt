Safety and tolerability of HER2-derived peptide vaccination measured by clinical and chemical parameters., To examine the safety and tolerability of HER2-derived peptide vaccination in patients with stage IV metastasized breast or gastric cancer with documented stable disease or objective response after at least first line systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy for advanced disease., Safety measurement will be assessed up to 113 days relating to start of study treatment
This is an interventional phase I clinical study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HER2-derived peptide vaccination. HLA-A2+ patients with stage IV metastasized breast or gastric cancer with HER2 expression (IHC Score 2+) without gene amplification proved by FISH analysis, with documented stable disease or objective response after at least first line systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy for advanced disease who have not been treated for the underlying malignant disease for 4 weeks with chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy will be included into the study. The aim of the study is to show safety and tolerability of this immunotherapeutic approach and to investigate efficacy of the immunotherapy.
