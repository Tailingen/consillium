Vitro Study of Tigecycline to Treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm companies with the BCR-ABL fusion gene encoded by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The BCR-ABL fusion protein(the formation of the chimeric gene BCR/ABL on chromosome 22 and a reciprocal ABL/BCR on chromosome 9,it has no expanded name) plays key role on CML leukemogenesis by activating its downstream signaling pathway of survival and proliferation. Imatinib, a targeted competitive inhibitor of a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, changed the clinical treatment and prognosis of CML. As its optimized generation, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib and nilotinib have more potent anti-leukemic activity and less side-effect. However, acquired resistance to TKIs is one of the main obstacles to effective CML treatment and is involved in gene amplication of ABL tyrosine kinase point mutations. The outcomes of patients with these ABL tyrosine kinase point mutations have linked to worse prognosis and higher mortality generally. Metabolic adaptations are common in cancer cells, and cancer cells become more dependent on mitochondrial biogenesis. Tigecycline, as a broad-spectrum antibiotics, inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis as its an interesting "side-effect".In recent study,researchers indicated that tigecycline can eradicate cancer stem cells by targeting mitochondrial.Here, the investigators test tigecycline's anti-leukemic activity to chronic myeloid leukemia in vitro.

In this study, the investigators collected bone marrow(BM) or/and peripheral blood(PB) mononuclear cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Patients could be in different stages of chronic myeloid leukemia pre-treatment.Additionally, the investigators also selected some healthy volunteers as comparison.Firstly, the investigators analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis and basal metabolic characteristic of mononuclear cells from patients and healthy volunteers.Secondly, the investigators tested the cell viability and apoptosis after tigecycline treatment.Thirdly,the investigators detected the changes of cell mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic characteristic in the same study sample after tigecycline stimulation. Finally,the investigators analyzed the correlation between sensitivities of mononuclear cells to tigecycline and patients' clinical parameters and survival outcome.
