A Trial of Camrelizumab Combined With Microwave Ablation and Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis/Pulmonary Metastasis
Currently, comprehensive treatments for liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis that cannot reach NED include systemic chemotherapy, interventional chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and local treatments (ablation therapy, radiation therapy, etc.) for liver metastases. Combination therapy model of local ablation, systemic chemotherapy, and anti-PD -1 monoclonal antibody hopefully can prolong patient survival. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of carrelizumab combined with microwave ablation and chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis

This is a phase II, single-arm prospective trial of local ablation combined with chemotherapy and camrelizumab for liver metastasis/pulmonary metastasis in colorectal cancer. The enrolled patients received ablation of liver metastases/pulmonary metastasis first, followed by chemotherapy (standard treatment plan for advanced colorectal cancer, determined by the investigator) and camrelizumab treatment (200mg, iv, q3w) one week later. If the patient has multiple metastatic tumors, ablation therapy needs to be performed in multiple times. Sequential chemotherapy and camrelizumab is administered one week after each ablation therapy. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary patient withdrawal.
