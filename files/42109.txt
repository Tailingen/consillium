Study of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in Oncological Lesions, Cardiovascular Atherosclerosis, Syndrome With Abnormal Immune Activation and sarcoïdosis
Phase II study to evaluate the clinical potential of 68GaNOTA-anti-MMR-VHH2 for in vivo imaging of Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR)-expressing Macrophages by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in patients with oncological lesions in need of non-surgical therapy, patients with cardiovascular atherosclerosis, syndrome with abnormal immune activation and sarcoïdosis.
Solid Malignancy Located in the Head and Neck|Cancer|Carotid Stenosis|Atherosclerosis of Artery|Hodgkin Lymphoma, Adult|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|HLH|Cardiac Sarcoidosis|Sarcoidosis
DRUG: 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2
Correlation of IMP uptake before start of treatment in malignant lesions of the head and neck with either treatment response during or after radiotherapy or systemic treatment, or with immunohistological MMR-staining in patients with surgical treatment, Uptake will be measured in cancer lesions on PET/CT 1. Treatment response will be evaluated by assessing time to treatment failure and by assessment of status of patients for treatment failure (Y/N) at 6 and 12 months after start of treatment or immunological MMR staining, up to 5 years|Correlation of uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 before start of treatment in solid cancer lesions with time to treatment failure after systemic treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition, either or not combined with other systemic therapies. (cohort 2), Uptake will be measured in cancer lesions on PET/CT 1. Treatment response will be evaluated by assessing time to treatment failure and by assessment of status of patients for treatment failure (Y/N) at 6 months and 12 months after start of treatment, up to 5 years|Correlation of uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in atherosclerotic carotid plaques before surgery with the immunohistological MMR-staining of the excised atherosclerotic carotid plaque.(cohort 3), Uptake in excised atherosclerotic plaque on PET/CT 1. Immunohistological MMR staining of excised atherosclerotic plaque, scored visually by interpreter, Resection of lesion up to 21 days after PET/CT|Correlation of uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in lymphoma-related lesions before start of treatment in Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients (cohort 4)., Uptake will be measured in lymphoma-related lesions on MMR-PET/CT 1, up to 5 years|Correlation of uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in central bone on PET/CT with the presence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow samples, and the presence of clinical risk factors (cohort 5)., Uptake in bone marrow on MMR-PET/CT 1. Bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy, scored individually by interpreter. Results of additional blood sample analysis to determine clinical risk factor, up to 5 years|To investigate the uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in cardiac sarcoidosis on PET/CT in patients with endomyocardial biopsy proven or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis (cohort 6), Uptake in lesions with known or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis on MMR-PET/CT on PET/CT1, up to 5 years|To investigate the uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in sarcoidosis on PET/CT in patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis (cohort 7), Uptake in lesions involved with sarcoidosis on MMR-PET/CT, up to 5 years
