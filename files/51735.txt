Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This study is being done to determine if targeted radiation therapy (stereotactic) can be given to treat liver cancer, for patient who are unable to undergo surgery, over a short period of time with a small amount of side effects.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
RADIATION: Stereotactic radiation
Stereotactic radiation therapy (either photon or proton) can be delivered to the liver with a less than 10% 3-month incidence of Grade 4 study related toxicity., Up to 90 days after end of radiation therapy
Measure the late toxicity associated with using stereotactic radiation therapy in patients with unresectable HCC and IHC., Up to 60 days after end of radiation therapy|Measure the local recurrence rates associated with using SBRT in patients with unresectable HCC and IHC., Time of treatment until recurrance or progressive disease as measured by CT/MR from baseline to recurrance or progressive disease|Measure the overall survival rates associated with using SBRT in patients with unresectable HCC and IHC., Baseline to time of death|Measure the response rates associated with using SBRT in patients with resectable HCC and IHC, Baseline to the first date of recurrance or progressive disease
