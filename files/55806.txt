A Cohort Study of Musculoskeletal Health in Patients With Breast Cancer During Aromatase Inhibitors Therapy
Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer are now prescribed aromatase inhibitors with 5 years or longer durations of therapy as recommended by clinical guidelines, which contributes to reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, aromatase inhibitors treatment is associated with a high incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS), often described as symmetrical pain, soreness in the joints, musculoskeletal pain, and joint stiffness, which even leads to bone loss, osteoporosis, and fractures. MSS reduces patients' quality of life and compliance with aromatase inhibitors therapy in up to one-half of women undergoing adjuvant aromatase inhibitors therapy, potentially compromising breast cancer outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to monitor the musculoskeletal health of breast cancer patients during endocrine therapy to provide references for clinical practice.
