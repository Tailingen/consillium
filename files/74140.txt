A Study of QL1604 Plus Nab-paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel in Subjects With Advanced Gastric Cancer.
This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.
