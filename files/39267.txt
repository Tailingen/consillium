Study Comparing G-CSF Mobilized Peripheral Blood and G-CSF Stimulated Bone Marrow in Patients Undergoing Matched Sibling Transplantation
This is a Randomized Multicentre study Comparing GCSF Mobilized Peripheral Blood and GCSF stimulated Bone Marrow in Patients undergoing matched sibling Transplantation for Haematologic Malignancies.
Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies
PROCEDURE: G-PB Transplant|PROCEDURE: G-BM Transplant
Efficacy, The use of G-BM is associated with a longer time to treatment failure (extensive chronic GVHD, relapse, death) than is the use of G-PB for adult myeloablative allogeneic transplantation for hematologic malignancies., 2 years
