A Phase I Study of AZD4635 in Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is a Phase I, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of AZD4635 in Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies. This study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. At least 3 or up to 6 evaluable Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled in Cohort1 and 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled in Cohort2.

Objectives:

Primary objective:

Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 monotherapy in Japanese patients

Secondary objective:

Characterize the single-dose and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD4635 monotherapy Determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AZD4645 monotherapy

Overall design:

This is a phase I, open-label study of AZD4635 in Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies.

The study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. At least 3 or up to 6 evaluable Japanese subjects with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled in Cohort 1 and 6 evaluable patients will be required for Cohort 2 to confirm the tolerability. The total number of evaluable subjects in each cohort will depend upon available data in each cohort and decision of Safety Review Committee(SRC).

Study Period:

The study is expected to start in June 2019 and end in June 2020.

Number of Subjects:

9 to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study to confirm the tolerability.

Treatments and treatment duration:

Subjects will receive AZD4635 once daily (QD). A single dose of AZD4635 will be taken on Cycle 0 Day1 and the subsequent dose of AZD4635 will be taken from Cycle 1 Day 1 until discontinuation criterion is met. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 21 days of continuous dosing.
