Prospective Feasibility Pilot Study Evaluating the Value of [68Ga]Ga-PENTIXAFOR PET-CT in Patients With Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) at Diagnosis and Disease Progression
\[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor PET-CT will be performed in patients with Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to confirm the targeting of CXCR4 by \[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC)
DRUG: [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor
To evaluate the concordance of tumoral lesions detected between [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor PET-CT and [18F]FDG PET-CT, considered as the reference, performed at diagnosis, The concordance between the two techniques (\[18F\]FDG PET-CT and \[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor PET-CT) will be assessed by lesion at diagnosis.

Cohen's Kappa coefficient will be calculated and accompanied by the probability of finding the same lesion on \[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor PET-CT knowing that it was present on \[18F\]FDG PET-CT (which may be similar to a measurement of sensitivity)., 30 days

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of lung cancers, but remains a cancer with a poor prognosis, often detected at a metastatic stage and associated with a high rate of early recurrence.

Therapeutic options for unresectable SCLC are limited and essentially rely on first-line radiochemotherapy for limited disease or chemo-immunotherapy, possibly supplemented by radiotherapy, for extensive disease.

CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor that is highly expressed in this cancer. By targeting CXCR4 with \[177Lu\]Lu-PentixaTher or \[90Y\]Y-PentixaTher, patients with SCLC could benefit from a new type of treatment in this indication: Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT).

However, there is a need for a preliminary diagnostic study due to a lack of published data.

\[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor is an experimental compound that binds with high affinity to CXCR4 and appears to be a promising candidate for PET-CT imaging of SCLC. This initial step is crucial to confirm CXCR4 targeting by \[68Ga\]Ga-PentixaFor before considering PRRT with therapeutic radionuclides such as Lu-177 or Y-90 in future trials.
