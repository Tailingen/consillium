Feasibility and Tolerability of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation With Concurrent Cognitive Training
In this study, the investigators are testing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in breast cancer survivors. In this pilot study, the investigators want to learn if it is feasible to use this device in memory rehabilitation.
