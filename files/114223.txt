Enhanced Outpatient Symptom Management to Reduce Acute Care Visits Due to Chemotherapy-Related Adverse Events
This clinical trial studies if enhanced outpatient symptom management with telemedicine and remote monitoring can help reduce acute care visit due to chemotherapy-related adverse events. Receiving telemedicine and remote monitoring may help patients have better outcomes (such as fewer avoidable emergency room visits and hospitalizations, better quality of life, fewer symptoms, and fewer treatment delays) than patients who receive usual care.

OTHER: Best Practice|PROCEDURE: Patient Monitoring|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Rate of acute care visits, Defined as the proportion of unique oncology patients with emergency room visits or hospital admission over a 3-month period., Up to 3 months
Change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), HRQOL will be assessed using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Profile-29 version 2.1., Baseline to 6 months|Change in patient engagement, Patient engagement will be evaluated with the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM), which assesses knowledge, skill, and self-efficacy for self-management of health, Baseline to 6 months|Change in symptom management, Daily symptoms will be measured using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., Baseline to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Determine the efficacy of remote patient monitoring (RPM) on improving clinical outcomes.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the following patient-centered outcomes: treatment delays, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL), patient activation, and family caregiver-experience.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive standard of care consisting of oncology care provided via telemedicine.

ARM II: Patients receive standard of care consisting of oncology care provided via telemedicine. Patients also undergo remote monitoring.
