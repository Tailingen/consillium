Assessment of Multi-Modality Quantitative Imaging for Evaluation of Response of Metastatic Prostate Cancer to Therapy
The study is an open label, non-randomized study designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of SPECT CT.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: SPECT CT|DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT|DRUG: 18F-NaF PET/CT|PROCEDURE: WB-MRI
Accuracy for Prediction of Progression Free Survival as determined by Quantitative bone SPECT indices (QBSIs), QBSI will be measured on SPECT scans at pre-defined intervals. A lower QBSI would mean likelier progression free survival., Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years
Reproducibility of the QBSIs using test-retest studies in 12 patients, Reproducibility measured by difference in QBSI between test-retest in 12 patients, as defined by the protocol. A smaller difference in QBSI reflects greater reproducibility., 5 years|Ability of QBSPECT to detect recurrence of metastatic disease as determined by QBSI in 60 patients., QBSI will be measured on QBSPECT images obtained at the same time as standard-of-care bone scans. A higher QBSI would predict earlier recurrence of metastasis., Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years|Accuracy of NaF PET/CT as determined by difference in QBSI from SPECT versus QBSI from NaF PET/CT in 20 patients, Difference in QBSI from SPECT versus NaF PET/CT. A smaller difference in the measured QBSI would reflect a higher accuracy of Na18F PET/CT. These images will be acquired within 32 hours of the bone scintigraphy scans at the pre-defined time points, per protocol., Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years|Accuracy of PSMA PET/CT as determined by difference in QBSI from SPECT versus QBSI from PSMA PET/CT in 20 patients, Difference in QBSI from SPECT versus PSMA PET/CT. A smaller difference in the measured QBSI would reflect a higher accuracy of PSMA PET/CT. These images will be acquired within 32 hours of the bone scintigraphy scans at the pre-defined time points, per protocol., Baseline, 6 months post-treatment, assessed up to 5 years|Correlation of QBSI from SPECT/CT to restricted diffusion obtained from whole body MRI, Ratio of QBSI obtained from SPECT imaging to quantitative biomarkers of restricted diffusion (diffusion-weighted imaging) obtained from a WB-MRI protocol., 5 years
The study is an open label, non-randomized study designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of SPECT CT. The study will consist of 3 cohorts, and a subset of the patients in cohort C will participate in a test-retest study, where the baseline SPECT/CT will be repeated.

SPECT CT will be performed in all cohorts.

Cohort A will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan using NaF.

Cohort B will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.

Cohort C will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WB-MRI).

Eligible subjects will be enrolled in a non-randomized manner per the treating physician discretion.
