ELACESTRANT in Women and Men With CDK4/6 Inhibitor-Naive Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER-2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elacestrant over the course of 6 months in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HER2-) advanced/metastatic breast cancer who received no prior cyclin-dependent kinase targeting enzymes CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) in the metastatic setting.

This is a Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of elacestrant in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer who received one or two prior hormonal therapies and no prior CDK4/6i in the metastatic setting.

The study duration for each patient is estimated to be:

* Screening Phase: Up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1);
* Treatment Phase: From C1D1 until the date of radiologically documented progression, or treatment discontinuation due to other reasons.
* Survival Follow-Up Phase: All patients will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months up to 24 months after enrollment of the last patient.

Patients will be followed for adverse events (AEs) for 28 days after the last treatment administration.
