Early Detection of Postoperative Anastomotic Leak by CT
Postoperative anastomotic leak is rare but life threatening complication after gastric cancer surgery. Early diagnosis is key to minimize other hazards which are caused by anastomotic leak. Investigators introduced a novel method to detect early diagnosis of anastomotic leak after gastric cancer surgery.
Anastomotic Leak
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: computed tomography
Diagnosis of anastomotic leak, CT was routinely used to detect early anastomotic leak after gastric cancer surgery, 5-10 days after surgery
Postoperative anastomotic leak is rare but life threatening complication after gastric cancer surgery. Early diagnosis is key to minimize other hazards which are caused by anastomotic leak. Investigators introduced a novel method to detect early diagnosis of anastomotic leak after gastric cancer surgery. Oral contrast agent is used for CT. Investigators carefully collected all the data prospectively and standard definition of anastomotic leak was applied.
