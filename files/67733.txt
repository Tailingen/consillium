Gemcitabine With Ascorbate Including Adolescents
The purpose of this research study is to see if a high dose of ascorbate (Vitamin C), in combination with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine, is safe and effective in adolescents with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas
