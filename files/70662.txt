Comparison of SBRTand Repeat TACE for HCC
Comparison of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)as a Local Salvage Treatment after first incomplete TACE
HepatoCellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: SBRT
Local tumor control (efficacy fo SBRT), To evaluate the effect of SBRT. Local tumor control is defined as the disappearance of any intraarterial enhancement in all target lesions.

Local tumor control will be measured on triphasic Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patient will be asked to visit their study doctor for follow-up exams and imaging (CT or MRI) every 3 months., 1 year
progression free-survival, survival from SBRT to recurrence, 2 year|overall survival, survival from SBRT to death, 2 year|Radiation induced liver disease (RILD), Liver toxicities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE).

RILD was defined as elevated liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit or a worsening of Child-Pugh (CP) score by 2 within 3 months after SBRT., 1 year
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of SBRT after first incomplete TACE.

In HCC patients with incomplete TACE response, repeated TACE did not showed good response. In this case, SBRT could have better results than TACE.
