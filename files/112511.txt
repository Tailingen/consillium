A Clinical Research of CD22-Targeted CAR-T in B Cell Malignancies
The overall purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD22-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of Malignant B-cell Derived Leukemia and Lymphoma.

CD22 is a type I transmembrane protein expressed on most mature B lymphocyte in the B cell malignancies，and plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways．Despite of the fact that CD19-targeted CAR-T can re-induce remissions for many patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies, a part of those patients will relapse with CD19-negative malignancies. To explore a rescue for those with CD19-negative B cell malignancies, we design and conduct this trial to test the safety and effectiveness of CD22-targeted CAR-T.
