Safety of each treatment arm will be measured in terms of adverse events, vital signs, clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and physical examinations., Cycle 1 of each treatment arm
Pharmacokinetics will be assessed in terms of Css,max, Css,min, tmax, AUCss and AUC0-8 for cediranib, and Cmax, tmax, AUC, AUC(0-t), CL or CL/F, t½λz for capecitabine, cisplatin and TS-1. Additional PK parameters may be determined., Cycle 1 and 2 of each treatment arm
