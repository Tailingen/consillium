Participant recruitment efficiency and retention rate, This outcome is measured by the ability to recruit and enroll 20 participants for the 2-month program, individual participant attendance in patient navigation intervention visits, and completion of final assessment., From baseline to completion of final assessment, approximately 2 months|Acceptability of intervention will be measured by likert-scale questions assessing helpfulness and satisfaction with intervention sessions, feedback on the intervention sessions, and smoking perceptions and behaviors changes, Acceptability will be measured by Likert-scale questions assessing helpfulness and satisfaction with patient navigation intervention sessions, feedback on the intervention sessions, and smoking perceptions and behaviors changes including perceptions of risk, nicotine dependence, stage of change., At the final assessment, 2 months after baseline. The changes in smoking perceptions and behaviors will be compared between baseline and final assessments.
Number of participants engaged in tobacco treatments, Engagement is defined as completion at least one tobacco cessation counseling session OR use of at least one FDA-approved cessation medication for at least 1 day., At the final assessment, 2 months after baseline
The investigators plan to conduct a 2-month 1-arm intervention study that will recruit up to 20 smoking cancer patients at Penn State Cancer Institute. All participants will receive a smoking cessation educational brochure and patient navigation intervention (in-person or by phone) delivered over two months. At the first intervention interview, the patient navigators will educate participants about the benefits of quitting, introduce smoking cessation resources, motivate participants to link with treatment, help participants attend smoking cessation treatments, and assess barriers that prevented them from being able to consider smoking cessation. The cessation treatment resources will be discussed include PennState Health Smoking Cessation Clinic, Pennsylvania Quitline, or visiting their primary care provider (PCP) to discuss cessation, prescription medications, and/or nicotine replacement therapy. A follow-up call will be made 1 month later to further assist and motivate to use tobacco treatment services, and assess interim tobacco treatment engagement outcome. At 2 months after baseline, the final questionnaire will be administered to assess participants' smoking behaviors, engagement in tobacco treatments, and satisfaction with the intervention.
