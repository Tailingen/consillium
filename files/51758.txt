DNA Evaluation of Fragments for Early Interception - Lung Cancer Training Study (DELFI-L101 Study)
The primary objective of this study, DELFI-L101, is to train and test classifiers for lung cancer detection using the DELFI assay and other biomarker and clinical features.
Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Bladder Cancer|Kidney Cancer|Stomach Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Pancreas Cancer|Liver Cancer|Skin Cancer
OTHER: Blood Sample Collection
Accuracy of lung cancer detection measured by sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC of the ROC., Approximately 12 months
Accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) in clinical subgroups of interest, Approximately 12 months|Prevalence-based measures, including positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and number needed to screen (NNS), Approximately 12 months|Accuracy of tumor of origin (confusion matrix of predicted versus actual cancer type), Approximately 12 months|Adverse events (AEs) associated with the blood specimen collection, Point in time of blood specimen collection (1day) at enrollment|Expected distribution of the DELFI score in the intended use population and clinical subgroups of interest, Approximately 12 months|Association of genomic features with clinical subgroups of interest, Approximately 12 months|Analytical performance (e.g. repeatability/reproducibility), Approximately 12 months|Accuracy of multi-cancer detection measured by sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC of the ROC and tissue of origin (TOO) accuracy, Approximately 12 months
Subjects will be enrolled into the DELFI-L101 study after informed consent and eligibility is confirmed. At enrollment, subjects will have blood specimens collected (\~40 mL) and 12 months post-enrollment their medical records will be reviewed.
