A Study of JNJ-90189892 for Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Neoplasms
The purpose of Part 1 (Dose Escalation) of the study is to assess the effective dose (recommended Phase 2 dose\[s\] \[RP2Ds\]) that can be safely administered, and dosing regimens of JNJ-90189892 in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or R/R higher-risk type of myelodysplastic neoplasms (type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow, which does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment). The purpose of Part 2 (Cohort Expansion) is to further assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy in participants with R/R AML or higher-risk types of MDS.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Neoplasms
DRUG: JNJ-90189892
Number of Participants with Adverse events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., From screening untill 30 days after last dose of study drug (that is approximately 2.5 years)|Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), DLT is defined as any toxicity that requires discontinuation of treatment, any Grade 5 toxicity; Non-hematologic toxicity (Grade 3 or 4) and Hematologic toxicity., At least 14 days
Serum Concentration of JNJ-90189892, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of JNJ-90189892., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Area Under the Curve Over a Dosing Interval (AUC tau) of JNJ-90189892, AUC tau is the total observed plasma concentration of JNJ-90189892 in the body during the time between doses. AUCtau of JNJ-90189892 will be reported., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-90189892, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration of JNJ-90189892. Cmax of JNJ-90189892 will be reported., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of JNJ-90189892, Cmin is the minimum observed plasma concentration of JNJ-90189892. Cmin of JNJ-90189892 will be reported., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Presence of Anti-JNJ-90189892 Antibodies, Participants with presence of anti-JNJ-90189892 antibodies will be reported., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Complete Response (CR) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), CR is achieved when a participant has a best response of CR (including complete response with partial hematologic recovery \[CRh\] or complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery \[CRi\]) according to the European Leukemia Network (ENL) 2022 criteria., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Overall Response (OR) in Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (MDS), OR is achieved when a participant with MDS has a CR (any type, that is CRh or complete response with limited count recovery \[CRL\]), partial response (PR), or hematologic improvement (HI) according to the International Working Group (IWG) 2023 criteria., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Complete Response in MDS, CR is achieved when a participant has a best response of CR (including CRh/CRL) according to the IWG 2023 criteria., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for responsders only, as time from date of initial documentation of a response to the first documented evidence of no reponse, disease progression, relapse, initation of a new systemic anti-cancer therapy (besides hematopoietic stem cell transplant \[HSCT\]), or death, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for responders, as the time from the first dose of study drug to first qualifying response., Up to approximately 2.5 years|Number of Participants Achieving Transfusion Independence, Transfusion independence is defined as the absence of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions for 8 weeks or longer after starting study treatment for participants with AML and 16 weeks or longer for participants with MDS., Up to approximately 2.5 years
The purpose of Part 1 (Dose Escalation) of the study is to assess the effective dose (recommended Phase 2 dose\[s\] \[RP2Ds\]) that can be safely administered, and dosing regimens of JNJ-90189892 in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or R/R higher-risk type of myelodysplastic neoplasms (type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow, which does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment). The purpose of Part 2 (Cohort Expansion) is to further assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy in participants with R/R AML or higher-risk types of MDS.
