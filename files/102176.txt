Study on Therapy of Non-invasive Prolactinoma
the study aim to investigate the endocrine remission rate of non-invasive prolactinoma between transsphenoidal surgery treatment and Dopamine agonist treatment.
Prolactinoma
PROCEDURE: transsphenoidal surgery treatment|DRUG: dopamine agonist treatment
Endocrine remission rate, After intervention, blood prolactin normalization rate, five-year
Non-invasive prolactinomas were treated by transsphenoidal surgery or Dopamine agonist until now. Howeverï¼Œthis two type therapies were controversial. The study aim to investigate the endocrine remission rate of non-invasive prolactinoma between transsphenoidal surgery treatment and Dopamine agonist treatment.
