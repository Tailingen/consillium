Yield Rate for Procurement the Histologic Core With Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Biopsy With 20-gauge Ultrasound Biopsy Needles for Solid Pancreatic Masses: Pilot Study
To investigate the technical feasibility and diagnostic yield of new 20-gauge Procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in pancreatic solid lesions.
Pancreatic Cancer|Solid Pancreatic and Peripancreatic Lesion
DEVICE: 20-gauge ProCore FNB needle
Procurement of the histologic core, The sample quality is evaluated as optimal for histological evaluation; the presence of optimal histological core including recognizable structures, 7 days after the procedure|Diagnostic accuracy, \[Standard diagnosis\]

* In operated patients; based on the surgical resection specimen
* In non-operated patients; based on the conclusions of the diagnostic work-up and confirmed by a compatible clinical disease course, 7 days after the procedure
Technical success, Technical failure is defined as malfunction of the needle before the investigators reached a diagnosis, 7 days after the procedure
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease at the time of diagnosis.

Regarding the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, proper tool with high diagnostic yield is very important. The investigators investigated the technical feasibility and diagnostic yield of recent-developed new 20-gauge Procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in pancreatic solid lesions.

The investigators applied the 20-gauge procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic solid mass. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled for the present pilot study.
