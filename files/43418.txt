Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Prostate Biopsy and/or Radical Prostatectomy
Clinically significant Prostate Cancer, Diagnosis of clinically significant PCa at prostate biopsy, 1 month|Overall survival, Death by any cause, every 6 month after surgery up to 50 years after surgery|Cancer-specific mortality, Death from prostate cancer, every 6 month after surgery up to 50 years after surgery|Biochemical recurrence, PSA \>= 0.2 ng/ml in 2 consecutive measures, every 6 month after surgery up to 50 years after surgery
Erectile function, IIEF-EF \>=21, every 6 month after surgery up to 50 years after surgery|Urinary continence, No pads over a 24 hour period, every 6 month after surgery up to 50 years after surgery
A database was created with the intention of collecting data related to patients who underwent prostate biopsy and/or radical prostatectomy.

Only anamnesis and biopsy procedure data are collected for patients underwent prostate biopsy.

Anamnesis, surgery, histological report and hospitalization data are collected for patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.

Each patient will be followed for 50 years from the date of radical prostatectomy surgery.

Each patient will receive a questionnaire before radical prostatectomy. A follow up questionnaire will be collected after surgery relating to quality of life. The data for each patient will then be transferred to the database itself. The data collected will be handled following the most strict GCPs and privacy norms.
