Phase I Study of Combined Immune Cell Therapy in Patients With Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer With Metastatic Lesion Who Failed Prior Standard of Care
To evaluate the safety, immune response, and potential efficacy of combined immune cell therapy in patients with stage 4 colorectal cancer who have failed standard treatment and have unresectable lesions or metastatic lesions.

The combined immune cell therapy has a strong potential to improve treatment outcomes in several cancers, but problems related to manufacturing complexity, immunocompatibility, and poteintial toxicity may also arise. This clinical study was designed to address these challenges and to establish the safety and potential efficacy of combined immune cell therapy for unresectable colorectal cancer. This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of combined immune cell theapy, and obtain the recommended dose and infusion plan.
