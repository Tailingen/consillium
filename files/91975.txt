IORT Following Breast Conserving Surgery for Early Stage Breast Cancer Registry
This is a prospective, registry trial which will enroll women aged 65 and above with early stage, low risk breast cancer who will be treated with partial mastectomy and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). The primary aim is to determine the 5-year risk of in-breast tumor recurrence. Secondary aims include identification of acute- and late-toxicity, cosmetic result, disease-free survival and overall survival.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: IORT
In-Breast Tumor Recurrence (IBTR), Ipsilateral In-Breast Tumor Recurrence (IBTR): defined as biopsy-proved invasive or in situ breast cancer (except LCIS) in the ipsilateral breast., 5 years
Late Toxicity, Degree of late radiation toxicity will be scored based upon RTOG/EORTC (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Eastern Oncology Radiation Therapy Consortium) late radiation morbidity scoring schema for subcutaneous tissue as well as cosmetic result.

The RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring schema on subcutaneous tissue is as follows:

* GRADE 1: Slight induration (fibrosis) and loss of subcutaneous fat
* GRADE 2: Moderate fibrosis but asymptomatic; slight field contracture; \<10% linear reduction
* GRADE 3: Severe induration and loss of subcutaneous tissue; field contracture \> 10% linear measurement
* GRADE 4: Necrosis, 5 years|Acute Toxicity, Acute radiation toxicity will be scored at the first follow-up visit after IORT (4-6 weeks after treatment).

Radiation dermatitis will be scored based upon CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.03 scale as follows:

* GRADE 1: Faint erythema or dry desquamation
* GRADE 2: Moderate to brisk erythema; patchy moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema
* GRADE 3: Moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion
* GRADE 4: Life threatening consequences; skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site; skin graft indicated

Other acute toxicity will also be scored per the CTCAE v4.03 scale and will be rated on the relation to radiation therapy (definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely related, unrelated), 3 months|Disease Free Survival, Disease Free Survival, 5 yeras|Overall Survival, Overall Survival, 5 years
