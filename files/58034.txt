Sorafenib + Topotecan for Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This multi-institutional phase I/II clinical trial will test the tolerability and efficacy of the combination sorafenib and topotecan in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, which is platinum-resistant (recurrence within 6 months from completing platinum based therapy) or refractory (progressive disease during platinum based therapy).
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Topotecan
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), An initial 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1. If all 3 patients in dose level 1 complete the first cycle of therapy without a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level 2. If 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients in dose level 2 experience a DLT, all subsequent patients will be enrolled in the Phase II cohort at dose level 2. If 2 of the first 3 or 2 of the total 6 patients experience DLT at dose level 2, then dose level 1 will be considered the MTD and used in the second phase., Each participant was treated at their assigned dose level on 28 day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants were evaluated for toxicity every two weeks.|Percentage of Participants With Response, To assess response in patients with recurrent or resistant epithelial ovarian cancer treated with Sorafenib plus Topotecan. Reponse evaluated per RECIST criteria where:

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started, Disease assessments were conducted on the 8th week (Cycle 2, Week 4) and every eight weeks there after, until treatment discontinuation
Progression-free Survival, To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with Sorafenib plus Topotecan., From enrollment until treatment discontinuation. Participants may remain on study drug indefinitely|Clinical Benefit, To determine the rate of clinical benefit defined as the percentage of patients experiencing an objective response or a CA125 response., From enrollment until treatment discontinuation. Participants may remain on study drug indefinitely|Duration of Stable Disease, To determine duration of stable disease, in months, From enrollment until treatment discontinuation. Participants may remain on study drug indefinitely
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

* Topotecan: 4mg/m2 weekly, 3 weeks on and one week off.
* Sorafenib: Assigned cohort dose for phase I (up to 12 patients) Maximum tolerated dose for phase II (21 total patients)

Cycles will consist of 4 weeks (28 days) with disease evaluations every 8 weeks.

Non-PD and acceptable toxicity: Patients will continue protocol therapy PD or unacceptable toxicity: Patients will discontinue protocol therapy
