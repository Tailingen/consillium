Study Evaluating Zr-Panitumumab for Assessment of Suspected Metastatic Lesions on 18F-FDG-PET/CT in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic utility of 89Zr-panitumumab to identify metastatic lesion(s) in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Head-and-neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: 89Zr-panitumumab IV|DRUG: Panitumumab
Sensitivity and Specificity of 89Zr-panitumumab, The total number of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma-involved incidental lesions will be determined and correlated to the radiologically suspicious lesions identified by 89Zr-panitumumab using PET/CT imaging., Up to 1 year
Sensitivity and Specificity 89Zr-panitumumab compared to standard of care 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, The total number of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma-involved incidental lesions will be determined and correlated to the radiologically suspicious lesions identified by 18F-FDG using PET/CT imaging. The specificity and sensitivity of 89Zr-panitumumab will be compared to the specificity and sensitivity of 18F-FDG for identification of metastatic lesions., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S):

- Determine the sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-panitumumab for the detection of suspected metastatic lesions

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

- Compare sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 89Zr-panitumumab-PET/CT for detection of suspected metastatic lesions
