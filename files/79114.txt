IIT PH1 KDS-1001 in Patients With CML
This open label, non-randomized, prospective phase I study is designed to evaluate if the addition of natural killer cell therapy (KDS-1001) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with persistent or recurrent molecular residual disease (MRD) after at least one year of TKI therapy will allow patients to achieve RT-PCR negativity (MRD negative). This may have implications for future TKI cessation studies.
