Somatostatin Receptor PET Imaging to Guide Radiotherapy Dose Escalation in High Risk Meningiomas.
High-risk meningiomas always require postsurgical radiation treatment. Recent evidence has shown that increased radiation therapy dose may be associated with increased intracranial control of disease. In order to better define the volume of radiation treatment, the addition of PET imaging with somatostatin receptor tracers adds additional information compared to encephalon MRI with MoC alone.The present study aims to investigate whether radiation treatment with higher doses than the standard and defined using PET imaging can be safe and at the same time effective in order to increase progression-free survival in high-risk meningiomas.
Meningioma
RADIATION: Dose escalation of radiation therapy, based on somatostatin receptor PET imaging
Incidence of brain radionecrosis, Incidence of symptomatic brain radionecrosis (grade \>=2 defined according to CTCAE scale v5.0)., up to 13 years|Assess progression free survival (progression free survival = PFS) at 3 years, Percentage of patients alive and free of disease progression at 3 years after the start of radiotherapy (PFS rate). Progression will be defined as increase in size of treated lesions or appearance of new lesions (according to RANO meningioma criteria), up to 13 years
Overall survival (Overall survival = OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time between enrollment and death, up to 13 years|Incidence of other toxicities, Incidence of other neurological toxicities graded using the CTCAE scale v. 5.0, up to 13 years|Concordance between GTV-RM and GTV-PET, Concordance will be measured according to Dice Similarity coefficient, up to 13 years
