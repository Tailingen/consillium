The purpose of this study is to produce a user-friendly tool to accurately assess early quality of life in postoperative patients following abdominal colorectal surgery in the early postoperative period (from surgery to 6 months) that is practical for routine application. The study will also compare this tool to the current available tools, namely the Short Form (SF-36), the short form inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), the Cleveland Clinic Global Quality of Life (CGQOL). Patients will be invited to participate if they are undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland.
