Acute Myocardial Infarction in Cancer Patients
Using national health insurance service database, current study aim to evaluate the risk and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction in cancer patients and to find the optimal treatment strategy for acute myocardial infarction that can improve long-term prognosis.
Acute Myocardial Infarction|Cancer
PROCEDURE: Revascularization
All-cause death, All-cause death which was obtained from death certification collected by Statistics Korea at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of South Korea, 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction
Myocardial infarction, Myocardial infarction is defined as presence of the diagnostic codes (ICD-10 I21, I22) in the primary position during hospitalization, 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction|Revascularization, Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction|Hospitalization for heart failure, Heart failure events requiring hospitalization defined as presence of the diagnostic codes (I110, I130, I132, I255, I420, I425-I429, I43, I50, I971) in the primary position during hospitalization, 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction|Stroke, Stroke is defined as ischemic stroke (ICD-10 I63, I64) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICD-10 I60-62), combined with the codes of diagnostic brain imaging., 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction|Clinically relevant bleeding, Bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion, 2-years after diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction
This study will be conducted using Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Patients who were diagnosed with cancer from 2002 to 2021 will be included in the study. Using the selected patients, current study will analyze the incidence and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction in cancer patients and the prognosis according to the treatment method for acute myocardial infarction will be compared. Primary outcome will be all-cause death. Secondary outcomes will be myocardial infarction, revascularization, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, and clinically relevant bleeding.
