HA-WBRT-SIB for Brain Metastasis of Lung Cancer
Patients with lung cancer and brain metastases undergo HA-WBRT-SIB using image-guided radiotherapy, receiving a total dose of 30-36 Gy delivered in 18-20 fractions to the whole brain (CTV), while the dose to the GTV is boosted to 44 Gy-52 Gy in 18-20 fractions, ﬁve times a week. The optimal mean dose (Dmean) to the bilateral hippocampus should optimally be ≤ 8 Gy, with a mandatory maximum dose (Dmax) to the hippocampus not exceeding 10 Gy; the preferred Dmean to the hippocampus PRV should optimally be ≤ 9 Gy, while the mandatory Dmax to the hippocampus PRV should be ≤ 12 Gy. The HVLT-R immediate recall scores are obtained at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.
