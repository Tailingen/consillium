A Retrospective Cohort Study Outcome of Treatment in Asymptomatic Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer
In asymptomatic Stage 4 colorectal cancer, the treatment varies between many hospitals and countries. Some studies found that primary tumor resection had better survival rates and a lower risk of mortality. But many studies found significant benefits in survival in sub groups of the population such as age less than 70 years, WHO performance status \<2, no extra-hepatic metastasis, liver tumor burden \<50%. However some studies showed no survival benefits in primary tumor resection. So this study will focus on survival, adverse events, complications in primary tumor resection and no primary tumor resection in asymptomatic Stage 4 colorectal cancer.
Stage IV Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: primary tumor resection group
Complication rate, The definition of complication defined as symptom that occurred during treatment period such as obstruction , perforation , bleeding , trenesmus., 5 year
The survival time, The survival time defined as time from diagnosis to death or last follow up period, 5 year
The retrospective study of patients in asymptomatic Stage 4 colorectal cancer received treatment at Ramathibodi Hospital and excluded symptomatic primary tumors such as obstruction, perforation that required surgery, carcinomatosis peritoneii, and patients with secondary cancer diagnosis in the past 5 years.
