DRUG: BCD-115
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-t), To determine AUC0-t after single doses of BCD-115 p.o. administration with dose escalation;, 90 days|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To determine observed maximum concentration in plasma or serums after single doses of BCD-115 p.o. administration with dose, 90 days|The incidence and severity of AEs, The incidence and severity of AEs (%) related with the therapy based on results of review by 3 experts (%), 90 days|The incidence of grade 3-4 AEs, The incidence of grade 3-4 AEs (%) related with the therapy based on results of review by 3 experts, 90 days
Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (%), 90 days
Multicentre dose-finding open-label non-comparative phase Ia/Ib clinical trial for investigation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of BCD-115 administered p.o. with intrapatient dose escalation in the population of patients with ER(+) HER2(-) advanced breast cancer in combination with a standard dose of endocrine therapy.

The trial will be conducted in two stages:

Stage 1 - finding of the maximum tolerated dose, determination of the recommended dose for Stage 2.

Stage 2 - study of the recommended dose from Stage 1 of BCD-115, analysis of tolerability and safety of selected dose/doses in additional cohorts, and determination of the estimated therapeutic dose/doses for further clinical studies.
