Humanized CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-Modified T Cell Therapy in Treating Patients With B-cell Malignancies
This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B Cell Lymphoma
GENETIC: Second generation humanized CAR-T cells
Number of participants with adverse events, Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0), 5 years
One-month remission rate, Response of B-ALL to CAR-T therapy was assessed on day 30 (Â±2), against the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, Version 1.2015)., 1 month|Overall survival, OS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 5 years|Event-free survival, EFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever came first, or last visit (censored)., 5 years|Relapse-free survival, RFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to relapse or last visit (censored)., 5 years|Rate of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate of CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry., 5 years|Quantity of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry., 5 years|Quantity of anti-CD19 CAR copies in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of anti-CD19 CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR., 5 years
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. To improve the efficacy and safety, the researchers designed a second-generation humanized CAR, consisting of humanized CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) and CD137 costimulatory domain. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
