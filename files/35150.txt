A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Preliminary Efficacy of KRC-01
This is a seamless Phase 1/2 study consisting of two components. Phase 1 component is a dose-escalation, single arm, open label study in 10 patients to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KRC 01. Phase 2 component is a randomized, open label, controlled, multi-center study in 60 patients to evaluate the preliminary antitumor effect of KRC-01 in combination with CRT.

DRUG: KRC-01|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation Therapy|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: brachytherapy
Adverse Events, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a study drug that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., 36 month|AEs of special interest, (local pain, radiation dermatitis, tumor lysis syndrome, superficial soft tissue fibrosis, vaginal stenosis, gastrointestinal/urinary AEs, and severe and medically significant bleeding (requires urgent intervention) after intratumoral injection), 36 month|Physical examination, The physical examination will include:

* General appearance
* Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
* Respiratory
* Cardiovascular
* Musculoskeletal
* Abdomen
* Neurologic
* Extremities
* Dermatologic
* Lymphatic Partial examination, patient will verbally report changes since last week., at the time of Screening and at Week 6 and partial examination will be done weekly in between to document relevant changes.|Tolerance, • Number of patients who have a significant treatment delays/interruption (total duration \> 59 days), week 1 to 6
Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease progression, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD., : minimum 2 years, maximum 3 years|Overall survival, mortality rates, minimum 2 years, maximum 3 years|Disease-free survival, Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. An event can be attributed to disease progression even without radiological or biomarker evidence of disease progression.

Deterioration of the disease under study and associated symptoms or findings, including the development of new, or the progression of existing, metastases, should not be regarded as an AE, unless the study medication is considered to have contributed to the progression., minimum 2 years, maximum 3 years|Health-related quality of life (QOL), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL 30-Item Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and EORTC 24-Item Cervical Cancer Questionnaire (QLQ-CX24), minimum 2 years, maximum 3 years
CRT poor responder rate, Poor responder is defined as 40 cc residual tumor at Week 4 or Week 5 assessed by MRI T2) in patients who have \> 40cc tumor at the baseline, Out to Week 4 or 5|Feasibility of hypoxia imaging, Diffusion-weighted imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) and Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), Screening and after the completion of KRC-01 dosing (between Week 6 to Month 3).
This is a seamless Phase 1/2 study consisting of two components. Phase 1 component is a dose-escalation, single arm, open label study in 10 patients to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KRC 01. Phase 2 component is a randomized, open label, controlled, multi-center study in 60 patients to evaluate the preliminary antitumor effect of KRC-01 in combination with CRT.

Phase 1 component (n=10) Phase 1 component is a dose-escalation single arm, open label study. All eligible subjects will receive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with cisplatin (40 mg/m2) intravenously (IV) once weekly for 5 weeks (sixth dose optional) followed by image-guided brachytherapy (BT).

KRC-01 will be dosed intratumorally within 2 hours prior to EBRT starting from second week of EBRT.

There are two cohorts (n=5 per cohort) Cohort 1: Once-a-week between Monday to Thursday (not necessarily the same day every week) Cohort 2: Twice-a-week with a 1- or 2- day interval (either Mon+Wed, Mon+Thu, or Tue+Thu)

After 5 subjects of Cohort 1 have completed CRT+BT, the safety review committee (SRC) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of KRC-01 once-a-week dosing and determine Go/ No Go decision to Cohort 2 (twice-a-week dosing).

After all 10 subjects have completed CRT+BT, the SRC will evaluate the safety and tolerability of KRC 01 and determine Go/ No Go decision to Phase 2 component with optimal dosing regimen.

Phase 2 component (n=60) Phase 2 component is a randomized, open label study. All eligible subjects will be randomized to Standard of care (SOC) group or SOC with KRC-01 group.

All subjects will receive EBRT with cisplatin (40 mg/m2) IV once-a-week for 5 weeks (sixth dose optional) followed by image-guided BT. Only for KRC-01 group, KRC-01 will be dosed intratumorally at the optimal dosing schedule selected in Phase 1 component within 2 hours prior to EBRT starting from second week of EBRT.
