Impact of Virtual Reality on Peri-interventional Pain, Anxiety and Distress in a Pediatric Oncology Outpatient Clinic
Pain and anxiety-inducing interventions have a major impact on pediatric patients. Pain reduction by virtual reality (VR) during port and vein punctures is well studied. This study investigates peri-interventional reduction of pain, anxiety and distress using VR compared to the standard of care (SOC) in a pediatric oncology outpatient clinic.

In a randomized, controlled cross-over design, patients aged 6-18 years experience potentially painful interventions accompanied by VR. All patients included in the study underwent port puncture or peripheral venous puncture in two observations : SOC (A) and VR (B) in a randomized order. Observational instruments include Numeral Rating Scale (NRS), Faces Pain Scale revised (FPS-r), Behavioral Approach Avoidance Distress Scale (BAADS), modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS-SF). In addition, parents and staff are interviewed. Specific conditions for VR in an outpatient clinic setting are being discussed.

Procedural Pain measured with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; scale 0-10; higher score stating higher levels of pain), Virtual Reality vs. Standard-of-Care, pre-, peri-, post-interventional (before puncture when entering intervention room, during puncture and 5 minutes after puncture)|Procedural Anxiety measured with modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS-SF; scale 23-100; higher score stating higher levels of anxiety), Virtual Reality vs. Standard-of-Care, pre-, peri-interventional (before puncture when entering intervention room and during puncture)|Procedural Distress measured with Behavioral Approach Avoidance Distress Scale (BAADS; scale 0-10; higher score stating higher levels of distress), Virtual Reality vs. Standard-of-Care, pre-, peri-interventional (before puncture when entering intervention room and during puncture)
Acceptance of VR in pediatric procedures (questionnaire using a 5-point-likert-scale), Parents and patients were given different statements, post-interventional (immediately after the intervention)|Implementation factors for VR in pediatric outpatient clinics (qualitive questionnaire), Involved staff were asked about experience/feedback, through study completion, ~ 1.5 years in total
