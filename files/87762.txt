Upper GI Serial Tumour Biopsies
This is a prospective translational research study in which tumour samples, blood samples and other biospecimens will be requested from patients with locally advanced or metastatic malignant oesophageal and gastric carcinoma. There are two parts to the study:

* Part A - evaluation of serial tumour biopsies
* Part B - evaluation of circulating biomarkers and other biospecimens
Oesophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Minor endoscopic biopsy
Determine levels of circulating biomarkers in upper GI cancer patients, To determine detectable levels of circulating biomarkers in patients with locally advanced and metastatic oesophageal and gastric carcinoma., 20 years|Correlating levels of biomarkers, To correlate circulating biomarker characteristics with serial tumour biopsies., 20 years|Predicting treatment resistance to anti-cancer therapy, To correlate sequencing/profiling data with clinical outcome data, including prognosis and response to systemic therapy., 20 years
This is a prospective, non-randomised, non-interventional, translational research study in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal and gastric carcinoma will be asked to donate tissue, blood and other available biospecimens for translational and biomarker research. This is an exploratory biomarker study to generate preliminary data for future research projects incorporating identified aberrations.

The overall aims of the study are to employ serial tumour biopsies, blood borne biomarkers and other biospecimens to investigate mechanisms of resistance to systemic therapy and develop predictive biomarkers of this resistance in patients with locally advanced and metastatic malignant oesophageal and gastric carcinoma. Blood biomarkers will include enumeration and characterisation of circulating blood cell subtypes, as well as the evaluation of circulating cell-free proteins and nucleic acids. Other biospecimens include urine, stool and hair follicle samples that the patient is willing to donate for research purposes, and ascitic, pleural, pericardial or cerebral spinal fluid, available to collect as part of clinically indicated procedures (standard care) and surplus to routine clinical requirements. These other biospecimens would be stored at the Biobank.
