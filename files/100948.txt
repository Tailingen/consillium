Intraluminal Peppermint Oil and Adenoma Detection Rate in Screening Colonoscopy
This is a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of peppermint oil spraying into the colonic lumen through the scope channel during screening colonoscopy. The primary outcome is to compare the colonic peristalsis between peppermint oil and placebo. The secondary outcomes compare the procedural time, polyp detection rate, adenoma detection rate, and adverse events.
Colonic Polyp
DRUG: Intraluminal peppermint oil|DRUG: Placebo
Adenoma detection rate(ADR), Number of adenoma per total participants who were colonoscopy in both groups, During colonoscopy
Adenoma per posititive participants(APP), Number of aenama in patients who had found at least one adenoma in both groups, During colonoscopy|Colonic peristalsis grading, Percentage of colonic peristalsis grade 0 and 1 in peppermint oil group in both groups, During colonoscopy|Time of polyps resection, Time of polypectomy per polyp in both groups, During colonoscopy|Intravenous anti-spasmodic agents, Percentage of intravenous anti-spasmodic agents in both groups, During colonoscopy|Adeverse events, Total number of adverse events in both groups, 24 hours after colonoscopy
