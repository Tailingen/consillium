MRI Characterization of Mammographically Detected DCIS
This is a single institution, prospective observational clinical trial for women with mammographically identified calcifications that may represent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

The purpose of this study is to determine whether quantitative, multiparametric breast MRI performed prior to surgical resection can biologically characterize this common pre-invasive malignancy, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which typically presents in asymptomatic women as suspicious calcifications on mammography.
Breast Cancer, Stage 0
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breast MRI|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Fractional perfusion (f), Assess whether high f within DCIS lesions correlates with proliferation (high Ki-67), 3.5 years|Tissue diffusion (Dt), Assess whether low Dt within DCIS lesions correlates with high proliferation (Ki-67), 3.5 years|Transfer constant (Ktrans), Assess whether high Ktrans within DCIS lesions correlates with inflammation (cox-2), 3.5 years
Signal enhancement ratio (SER), Assess whether low SER can exclude the presence of DCIS-associated malignancy at the site of mammographic calcifications, 3.5 years|Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Assess whether high ADC can exclude the presence of DCIS-associated malignancy at the site of mammographic calcifications, 3.5 years|Oncotype DCIS Score, Develop a multivariate MRI model to identify low risk DCIS (Oncotype DX DCIS score\<39), 3.5 years|Transfer constant (Ktrans), Assess whether high Ktrans in the peri-tumoral tissue correlates with stromal inflammation (TNFalpha), 3.5 years|Fractional perfusion (f), Assess whether high f in the peri-tumoral tissue correlates with angiogenesis (VEGF), 3.5 years
The investigators will assess whether MRI signatures can determine which calcifications identified prior to surgical resection actually harbor DCIS, and whether these imaging features correlate with pathologic markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and inflammation (cox-2) within DCIS lesions.

The investigators will also explore whether quantitative MRI features in the peri-tumoral region correlate with prognostic microenvironment markers of inflammation (TNFÎ±) and angiogenesis (VEGF). Finally, investigators will assess whether a multivariate model using these markers can accurately predict risk of recurrence based on a multi-gene assay (Oncotype DX DCIS score).
