Docetaxel/Prednisone Plus Fractionated 177Lu- J591 Antibody for Metastatic, Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of the experimental drug, 177Lu-J591 antibody in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy against metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: 177Lu-J591|DRUG: 177Lu-J591|DRUG: 177Lu-J591|DRUG: 177Lu-J591|DRUG: 177Lu-J591
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fractionated 177Lu-DOTA-J591 administered concurrently with three-weekly docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer., 4 weeks post last J591 dose
Determine the toxicity profile of concurrent docetaxel with fractionated 177Lu-DOTA-J591, completion of study treatment
This research is being done because the standard treatments for metastatic prostate cancer that is growing despite medical or surgical therapies are not curative. Existing treatments, such as the docetaxel used as part of this study, may work temporarily, but unfortunately the cancer continues to grow. This test drug, 177Lu-J591, is designed to seek out prostate cancer cells and deliver a lethal dose of radiation to the areas of cancer, but not to normal areas. Some of the normal organs (liver, kidney and bone marrow) do receive some radiation dose that is within the acceptable limits.
