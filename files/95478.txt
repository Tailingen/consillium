Curcumin in Treating Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
This randomized phase II trial studies curcumin in treating patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Curcumin may prevent colorectal cancer in patients with a history of rectal polyps or colorectal neoplasia.
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
DRUG: Curcumin|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Placebo
Polyp Number, Average number of polyps in the placebo arm at the end of the study is compared to the average in the curcumin arm, Up to 12 months
Mean Polyp Size in mm, Mean size of the 5 largest polyps, Up to 12 months|Number of Participants With a Decrease in Polyp Burden at 12 Months, The polyp burden as evaluated by video tape review. Polyp burden at 12 months compared to time 0 for each participant and counting participants with decrease in polyp burden at 12 months., 12 months|Number of Participants With Grade >=2 Adverse Events, Events were graded as follows:

Grade 0= no adverse event or within normal limits; Grade 1= mild adverse event (causing no limitations of usual activity); Grade 2= moderate adverse event (causing some limitation of activity); Grade 3= severe adverse event (severe and undesirable; causing inability to carry out usual activities; Grade 4= life threatening or disabling adverse event; Grade 5= fatal adverse event., Up to 12 months|Medication Compliance, Medication compliance of the participant= number of capsules taken divided by the number of capsules prescribed as determined by pill count and described as a percentage per participant. Then the compliance of each participant in the assigned group (curcumin or placebo) was averaged together to obtain the medication compliance rate of that group., Up to 12 months|Change in Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) Activity Levels, Change in ODC mean activity levels (expressed as nmol of activity/mg of mucosal tissue/hr) at 8 months compared to baseline (time 0), Baseline and 8 months|Change in Total Polyamines Levels, Polyamine mean level changes (expressed as pg/mg protein) at month 8-baseline, Baseline and 8 months|Change in Micro RNA 124-U6 (miR124-U6), Change in MicroRNA mean activity level at 8 months compared to baseline (time 0), Baseline and 8 months|Change in Spermidine/Spermine N-1 Acetyl Transferase (SSAT), Change in SSAT mean activity level at 8 months compared to baseline (time 0), Baseline and 8 months|Change in Spermine Oxidase (SMOX), Change in SMOX mean activity level at 8 months compared to baseline (time 0), Baseline and 8months|Change in Ki-67 Anti-proliferative Cell Nuclear Antibody Index Levels, Change in cellular proliferation rate was measured by assessment of Ki-67 anti-proliferative cell nuclear antibody index levels at 8 months, Baseline up to 8 months|Change in Apoptosis Index Levels, Change in apoptosis index levels at 8 months by assessing cleaved Caspase-3 measurement, 8 months
Change in Mucosal DNA Methylation Levels., Baseline to up to 12 months|Change in Mucosal Leukotriene Levels., Baseline to up to 12 months.|Change in Mucosal Prostaglandin Levels., Baseline to up to 12 months.|Number of Patients Failing Study., Patients withdrawn from study due to increasing polyp burden and/or advancing histology., Up to 16 months.|Change in Vascular Density, Baseline up to 12 months|Activation of NFKB (Nuclear Factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer of Activated B Cells) Pathway, Baseline to 12 months|Change in Akt Phosphorylation Levels, Baseline up to 12 months
Specific Aims:

I. To determine in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study the tolerability and effectiveness of curcumin to regress intestinal adenomas by measuring duodenal and colorectal/ileal polyp number, and polyp size in familial adenomatous polyposis patients with intact colons, ileorectal anastomosis surgery, or ileo-anal pullthrough (reservoir) surgery.

II. To measure markers of cell proliferation including colorectal mucosal levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), polyamines, mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, proliferative index (Ki67 antiproliferative cell nuclear antibody), apoptosis index, vascular density, mucosal prostaglandin, leukotriene levels, and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) survival pathways.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Arm I: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 months.

Arm II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 months.
