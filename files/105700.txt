Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) in Seborrheic Keratosis Study
The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) to clear or remove Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) lesions from off-facial areas of healthy adult subjects.
Lesion Skin|Seborrheic Keratosis
DEVICE: Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS)
Clearance of SK Lesions, Total Number of treated SK lesions per participant rated as clear or mostly-clear by the Principal Investigator at each clinical site., 106-day post-treatment
Evaluate Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) to clear or remove Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) lesions from off-facial areas of healthy adult subjects.

The specific objectives of this study are to:

* Document the non-treated appearance of off-face SKs.
* Evaluate the clearance of SKs in off-face locations post-treatment versus pre-treated appearance of the same lesion.
* Evaluate the clearance of the treated SKs at various points in time over several weeks following the initial procedure, compared to the pre-treated SKs.
