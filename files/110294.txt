Textbook Outcome in Adrenal Neoplasms
BACKGROUND:

Textbook outcome (TO) is a multidimensional quality management tool that uses a set of traditional surgical measures to reflect an "ideal" surgical result for a particular pathology. The aim of the present study is to record the rate of TO in patients undergoing elective surgery for adrenal neoplasms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

Retrospective study of all patients undergoing scheduled adrenal neoplasms surgery at a Spanish university hospital from September January 2010 to December 2022. Emergency surgeries were excluded. The variables included in the definition of TO were: R0 resection, no Clavien-Dindo ≥IIIa complications, no prolonged stay, no readmissions, and no mortality in the first 30 days.

The main objective of this study is to analyse the achievement of TO in a series of patients undergoing scheduled adrenal neoplasms resection at the Doctor Balmis General University Hospital in Alicante, Spain. The investigators compare the group of patients who achieve a TO result with the group of patients who do not. A univariable and multivariable analysis will be carry out in order to indentified the variables associated with TO.
