Thin-EBUS in Ex-vivo Human Lungs
This study will determine the feasibility of the novel thin convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (TCP-EBUS) in human resected lobes. The primary end point is to clarify the feasibility of using the thin convex probe EBUS scope to visualize lung tumors from an intra-bronchial view. The secondary objective is to evaluate the insertion ability, operability, endoscopic image and ultrasound image compared to that of the convex probe EBUS.

DEVICE: Thin Convex Probe Endobronchial Ultrasound (TCP-EBUS)
To clarify the feasibility of using the thin convex probe EBUS scope to visualize lung tumors from an intra bronchial view., The TCP-EBUS bronchoscope will be inserted through the endotracheal tube for visualization of lobar, segmental and sub segmental bronchi., Within an hour of resection.
