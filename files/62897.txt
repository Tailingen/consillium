An Immuno-bridging Study of a Nonavalent HPV Vaccine (E.Coli) in Healthy Population Aged 9-17 vs Aged 18-26 Years Old
This is a open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Nonavalent (Types 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58)Vaccine(E.Coli) manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., Ltd., in healthy population aged 9-17 years old in comparison with aged 18-26.
Cervical Cancer|Condylomata Acuminata
BIOLOGICAL: 3 doses of the Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Nonavalent (Types 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58 )Vaccine(E.Coli)|BIOLOGICAL: 2 doses of theRecombinant Human Papillomavirus Nonavalent (Types 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58 )Vaccine(E.Coli)
Immunogenicity1: Anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 type specific antibody levels at Months 7 in the population aged 9-26 years old receiving 3 doses of the nanovalent vaccine, To determine whether the immune responses (antibodies to HPV-6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) at month 7 (one month after the final dose) in the population aged 9-17 years receiving 3 doses of the nanovalent vaccine are noninferior to those in women aged 18-26 years receiving 3 doses of vaccine., 7 months after the first dose

To evaluate number of SAEs between the different arms., Up to 8 month|Safety4: Pregnancy and pregnancy outcome., Pregnancy and pregnancy outcome. To evaluate number of births and terminations between the different arms., Up to 8 month
