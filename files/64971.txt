A Study to Investigate The Effectiveness Of Atezolizumab In Patients With Inoperable Locally-Advanced Or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma Of The Urinary Tract (Announce)
The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Atezolizumab with a primary focus on the overall survival (OS) rate at 2 years and secondary focuses on quality of life (QoL) and the sequence of treatment in mUC patients. Furthermore, this study aims at collecting data on safety of Atezolizumab and on the reason for cisplatin-ineligibility
