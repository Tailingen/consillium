Pulsatile Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone for Infertility in Non-obese Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are often accompanied by infertility. Non-obese PCOS infertility is more difficult to treat than obese PCOS. The study included non-obese PCOS patients who had not recovered from regular menstruation after six months of metformin treatment. Half of the patients were treated with clomiphene for ovulation induction and half with GnRH pulse therapy.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Infertility|Ovulation Disorder
DRUG: Gonadorelin|DRUG: Clomiphene
Number of participants with ovulation recovery (according to basal body temperature, progesterone levels on cycle day 21, or ultrasonography), Number of participants with ovulation recovery (according to basal body temperature, progesterone levels on cycle day 21, or ultrasonography) after use of drugs, up to 12 weeks
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0. Evaluation of efficacy and safety of short-term GnRH pulse therapy for non obese PCOS, up to 12 weeks
To investigate whether GnRH pulse therapy of non-obese PCOS women can improve ovulation rate.The investigators plan to recruit non-obese PCOS women with abnormal GnRH pulse mode not effective of metformin treatment at childbearing age. By using GnRH pulse therapy and Clomiphene therapy. the investigators will intervent the participants for 3 months and to compare outcome in each group.
