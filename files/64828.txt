A Study of Bevacizumab in Previously Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (SALUTE)
This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, randomized study for preliminary evaluation of the efficacy and safety of combining bevacizumab with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide in patients with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Chemotherapy|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Duration of PFS, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or on-study death, whichever occurred first., Randomization until progression or lost to follow-up (up to 2 years)
Overall Survival, Duration of overall survival from randomization until death or loss to follow-up, Randomization until death or lost of follow-up (up to 27 months)|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response, Objective response was defined as a complete or partial response (per RECIST) determined by two investigator assessments conducted at least 4 weeks apart.
