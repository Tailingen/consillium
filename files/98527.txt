The Association Between CBT-I Dose and Innate Immunity in Insomnia and Fatigue in Prostate Cancer Patients
The objective of this project is to test the association between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia dose (number of sessions), severity of cancer related fatigue, and levels of innate immunity biomarkers. Ultimately, this research will help to develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer related fatigue.

Fatigue, Fatigue, as measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form and the FACIT-Fatigue scale., From enrollment to three months post-treatment|Insomnia Severity, As measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, From enrollment to post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment
Sleep Continuity, As measured by the daily sleep diary, including sleep latency, number of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time and sleep efficiency., From enrollment to post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment.]
Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and insomnia are prevalent among cancer patients and have been linked to decreases in quality of life and poorer overall survivorship. Currently, the mechanisms underlying CRF are not well understood, which has led to treatments that are only moderately effective. In addition, when compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in the general population, the treatment outcomes in CBT-I with cancer patients are subpar and, as such, this study will evaluate whether dose of CBT-I is effective in ameliorating CRF.
