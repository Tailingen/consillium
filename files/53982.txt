Non-Invasive Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Disease Management
This study is an observational retrospective/ prospective study with diagnosed low/intermediate risk (no-surgery) \& high risk (surgery) prostate cancer that are eligible and willing to undergo standard of care (SOC) assessment, annually along with biopsies, bio-fluid collection. Participants will obtain genomic and histological evaluation on their biopsied samples. Study follows SOC collection with additional body fluid collection (blood, urine). Biopsy/surgery will not require additional sample collection
Prostate Cancer
GENETIC: Genomic and Histological Evaluation
Disease Progression, Progression will be defined according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines.

Intermediate risk group (no-surgery): Evaluation of targeted lesion indicates any one of the following: a) Gleason grade group of 2 or 3 (Gleason Score: 3+4 or 4+3), b) re-biopsy of lesion results in higher Gleason grade, initial GS 3+3 becomes a 3+4 or higher and c) secondary end point include clinical progression assessed by radiological progression (increased PIRADS score) and/or serum progression (PSA increase).

High risk group (surgery): Participants who undergo prostatectomy as standard of care recommendation, following the NCCN guidelines. Participants in this group fall under these clinical characteristics: a) unfavorable intermediate-risk: biopsies with GS 4+3 or higher, b) high risk for prostate cancer progression: biopsies with GS 4+4 or greater or cT3 or greater disease, c) Progression following treatment, increase in PSA (, Up to 3 years
