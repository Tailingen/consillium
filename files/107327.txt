Pilot Study Immunomonitoring Natural Killers Cells in Patients With Myeloid Malignancies Treated With Lenalidomide
This project is a framework for developing new therapeutic strategies for acute myeloid leukemia(AML)based immunotherapy.

the role of NK cells was demonstrated in AML and especially GVL effect (graft versus leukemia) during allogeneic transplantation in these patients. However, it has been shown that the phenotype of NK cells and their cytotoxic functions were altered during this malignancy. In addition, in these patients, impaired NK function is associated with relapse.

lenalidomide it would have a beneficial effect on NK cells of AML patients? Does it have a role in leukemic cells in this malignancy? what is its effect on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines? In vitro data show an effect of lenalidomide on the phenotype of NK cells from healthy donors and patients with LAM, and despite these phenotypic changes, the cytotoxic capacity of NK is not altered.Lenalidomide also induces a significant increase in the production of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor) by NK.

It also seems to have an effect on leukemic blasts of AML. So, the investigators hope this study confirm these results in vivo in peripheral blood cells in patients treated with lenalidomide.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplasic Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Realization of 3 Blood samples during study during treatment with lenalidomide
Evaluation of NK functions, Evaluation with blood analysis, Time from inclusion (Day 0) until Day 28
cytotoxic response therapy, Evaluation of cytotoxic response therapy with lenalidomide, Time from inclusion until relapse or death (until 5 years)
