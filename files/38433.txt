A Study to Investigate LYL845 in Adults With Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study with expansion cohorts, designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of LYL845, an epigenetically reprogrammed tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) metastatic or locally advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer (CRC).

BIOLOGICAL: LYL845
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Evaluate incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Up to 28 days|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Evaluate incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 2 years|Severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Evaluate severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 2 years|Determine recommended Phase 2 Dose Range (RP2DR), Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose range (during dose-escalation phase), Up to 2 years
Overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST, version 1.1, Evaluate anti-tumor activity of LYL845 based on overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST, version 1.1, up to 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Evaluate duration of response (DOR), up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Evaluate overall survival (OS), up to 2 years
This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study with expansion cohorts, designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of LYL845, an epigenetically reprogrammed tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) metastatic or locally advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). During the dose-escalation phase of the study (Part A), participants with melanoma will be enrolled. Once a safe recommended Phase 2 dose range (RP2DR) has been established in Part A, enrollment will be expanded (Part B) to include additional participants with melanoma, NSCLC and CRC.
