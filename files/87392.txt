A large portion of CLL patients has no indications of chemotherapy when diagnosed. In patients with CLL, the mean serum selenium levels are lower than normal. There is a correlation between the selenium level and the clinical stage. We discovered that sodium selenite inhibited the expression of CXCL-1 and restored the defective necroptotic pathway of CLL cells together with TNF-Î± and z-VAD in vitro. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Selenious Yeast Tablets in preventing CLL patients without indication of chemotherapy from disease development.
