Obinutuzumab, Zanubrutinib, and Lenalidomide Followed Short-Cycle of Obinutuzumab and Cytarabine in Newly Diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This study aims to preliminarily explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of Obinutuzumab and Zanubrutinib plus Lenalidomide (ZGR) followed by a short cycle of cytarabine and Obinutuzumab in the induction treatment of newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) . The investigators propose ZGR followed by a short cycle of Obinutuzumab and cytarabine could be an effective first-line treatment for MCL.

Complete response rate (CRR), defined as the proportion of patients with complete response as assessed by response to induction therapy using the 2014 Lugano criteria., up to the end of 9 cycles of treatment(each cycle is 28 days)
overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial response as assessed by response to induction therapy., up to the end of 9 cycles of treatment(each cycle is 28 days)|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate of, defined as the proportion of patients with MRD negative (less than 10-4) in bone marrow by flow cytometry after induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients with bone marrow invasion., up to the end of 9 cycles of treatment(each cycle is 28 days)|Progress-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause., up to 5 years|Duration of tumor remission (DoR), defined as the time from the first treatment response (including complete response and partial response) to the last assessment of response., up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from enrollment to death for any cause., up to 5 years
Based on the clinical need for first-line treatment of MCL, this study proposed to enroll 39 patients with MCL who have not previously received any systemic therapy for MCL. All patients were treated with ZGR regimen for 6 cycles after enrollment, followed by 3 cycles of Obinutuzumab + cytarabine in 28-day cycles. For non-high-risk patients, lenalidomide and Zanubrutinib were used for maintenance; high-risk patients continued Lenalidomide and Zanubrutinib for maintenance following CAR-T cell therapy for 1 year for Lenalidomide and 2 years for Zanubrutinib. The primary endpoint of CRR and secondary endpoints (including ORR, PFS, DoR, and OS) were followed and recorded to explore the efficacy and safety of ZGR followed by a short cycle of Obinutuzumab and cytarabine induction therapy in treatment-naive MCL.
