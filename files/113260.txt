Phase II Study of AS1402 Combined With Letrozole to Treat Breast Cancer
The aim of this study is to compare the overall tumour response rate per RECIST in postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer receiving AS1402 in combination with letrozole compared to letrozole alone
