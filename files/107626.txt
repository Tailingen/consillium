Comparison of Genomic and Transcriptomic Patterns Between CTC and Metastatic Tumormetastatic Tumor
This study aims to understand the metastasis in advanced NSCLC through comparing genomic and transcriptomic patterns between the circulating tumor cells and metastatic tumor cells by single cell sequencing analysis.
NSCLC Stage IV|NSCLC Stage IIIB
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: cohort study
The gene expression and the cell population, Methods for the single cell RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing of the tumor cells With the tissue biopsied specimens, scRNAseq (by 10X Genomics platform) and whole exome seq will be carried out., 3 year
