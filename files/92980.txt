Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerate, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of CYH33
This study is a Multi-center, Open-label, single arm, Dose Escalation and Dose Extension Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety , Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of CYH33 in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: CYH33 for tablet
MTD(Max tolerance does), To evaluate the MTD in patients with advanced solid tumor, 35 days
This study includes Phase Ia and Phase Ib.

In the dose climbing part of phase Ia, the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics characteristics of CYH33 in patients with advanced solid tumors who failed to receive standard treatment, did not tolerate or did not have standard treatment at present will be observed to determine MTD; Before determining MTD, select safe and highly reliable and effective dose levels for simultaneous expansion. Phase Ia dose expansion includes patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed to undergo standard treatment, who are intolerant of PIK3CA gene mutation, or who do not have standard treatment at present, to further evaluate safety, tolerance and initial efficacy.

In Phase Ib, the safety and preliminary efficacy of CYH33 on patients with advanced breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal and gastroesophageal junction squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian clear cell carcinoma and other solid tumors with PIK3CA gene mutation who have failed, are intolerant or do not have standard treatment at present will be evaluated.
