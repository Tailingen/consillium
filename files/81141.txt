Hypofractionated Radiosurgery for Localised Prostate Cancer
Hypofractionated radiosurgery has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible.

Investigators initiated this multicenter phase II prospective trial to analyse feasibility (toxicity) of hypofractionated radiosurgery with 5 fractions in patients with localised prostate cancer, who are ineligible for the "PREFERE trial" under the hypothesis that the ratio of patients with late toxicity â‰¥ grade 2 after 1 year amounts 2,8% and is significant lower than 17.5%.

RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiosurgery
Late toxicity measured with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-(RTOG)-Score, 12-15 months after radiotherapy
Acute toxicity analysed by Adverse Event (AE)- and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)-reports., through study completion|Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), At the time of inclusion and 1, 3, 6-9 and 12-15 months after radiotherapy|International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Screening and 3, 6-9 and 12-15 months after radiotherapy|EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30, At the time of inclusion and 12-15 months after radiotherapy
Experimental radiosurgery of prostate with 5 fractions each with 7,00 Gy (total application rate of 35,00 Gy).

Planned visits are: Baseline, visits at every radiation day and four follow ups (4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and one year after last day of radiation).
