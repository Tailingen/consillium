A Clinical Trial Targeting CEA Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) for CEA Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open, dose-increasing phase I clinical study to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug C-13-60 cells, and preliminarily observe the efficacy of the drug in CEA positive late malignant solid tumors, and explore the applicable dose regimen for phase II clinical trials.

BIOLOGICAL: CEA-targeted CAR-T cells
To determine the dose range and DLT of C-13-60 cells for CEA positive advanced malignant solid tumors [Safety and Tolerability], The incidence of adverse events (TEAE) after treatment; Incidence of treatment-related adverse events; Adverse evens of Special Interest (AESI);, 1 month|To obtain the maximum tolerable dose of C-13-60 cells [Safety and Tolerability], Incidence and number of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) cases，Dose-limiting toxicity after CAR-T cell infusion, 1month
Disease control rate (DCR) within 3 months after infusion of C-13-60 cell preparation[Effectiveness], Disease control rate: The proportion of subjects who achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 3 months|Area under the curve (AUCS) of C-13-60 cell [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 90 days, 3 months|Maximum concentration (CMAX) of C-13-60 cell [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of CEA CAR-T cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|Maximum time (TMAX) of C-13-60 cell[Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|The content of CEA in peripheral blood after infusion of C-13-60 cell [Cell dynamics], The concentration of serum CEA in peripheral blood was detected by ELISA at the visit points specified in the research protocol, 3 months
Objective response rate (ORR) of C-13-60 cell treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of C-13-60 cell treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of C-13-60 cell treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression(Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 2 years|Overall survival(OS) of C-13-60 cell treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on RECIST criteria), 2 years
According to the sequence principle of low and high dose of C-13-60 cell reinfusion, the dose escalation experiment was carried out successively. Three subjects in each dose group were enrolled first. If DLT did not appear, the decision of whether to enter the next dose group was made according to Safety review committee (SRC) resolution. If there was one case of DLT, then 3 subjects were enrolled one by one, and DLT observation was completed for 28 days after each subject's infusion. If no DLT was found, the next infusion was continued. If DLT was found, the subsequent enrollment of the dose group was terminated, and the experiment was terminated or the dose was reduced according to the dose increasing principle. If \> 1 case of DLT occurs, the trial is terminated or the dose is reduced.According to the evaluation of the researchers, the subjects who met the conditions of antisepsis received antisepsis chemotherapy 1-5 to -3 days before the transfusion of C-13-60 cells；
