Immunotoxin in Peritoneal Carcinomatosis- ImmunoPeCa Trial
The purpose of this study is through a phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety and toxicity of intraperitoneally administered MOC31PE immunotoxin, given on the 1.postoperative day after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).

MOC31PE is an immunotoxin that has previously been evaluated in a phase I clinical study involving patients with advanced EpCAM positive carcinoma to assess the safety and tolerability profile and the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound. In this study, the compound was administered intravenously and was well tolerated. MOC31PE will now be evaluated on the same parameters in a new phase I/II clinical trial, where the drug will be administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal metastases from EpCAM positive colorectal carcinomas.
