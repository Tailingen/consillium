Microbial Diversity of Pancreatic Diseases
This study plans to analyze the digestive flora structure of the group of patients with pancreatic cancer.

The investigators compared the microflora of pancreatic cancer with other pancreatic diseases and healthy people，in order to obtatin the information of microbial community difference among the different groups. Finally，the investigators hope to identify the potential biomarker and pathogenic mechanisms that causes the onset and progression of pancreatic diseases.

16sRNA and metagenomics, Obtain intestinal microbial information from patients with pancreatic cancer and other pancreatic diseases, and obtain information on microbial community structure, evolutionary relationships, and microbial and environmental correlations in intestinal environment samples(weight in grams).

Correlate the patient's microbial profile with the pathogenesis of the patient to obtain biomarkers related to the pathogenesis., 12/2022
First, all the participants provided written informed consent for participating in the study. And the collecting procedures have no intervention or impact on treatment measures.

Second,the samples are collected, including the stools, the peripheral blood, and other digestive secretions. If the participants had surgical indications and received surgical treatment, the surgical resections of tissues (including paraffin section) are also collected.

Third, the participants were basically divided into three groups，cases with pancreatic cancer, cases with other pancreatic diseases, and health volunteers.

Finally, the investigators compare the microflora , its metabolites or effects among the different groups in their stool, digestive secretions, peripheral blood, pancreatic tissues ( (including paraffin section)) and so on, and hope to identify the potential biomarker and pathogenic mechanisms that causes the onset and progression of pancreatic diseases.
