Clinical Application of Near-infrared Fluorescence Guided Localization on Breast Surgery in Benign Breast Neoplasm.
Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has been used for breast cancer surgery such as sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and breast cancer localization.

In this study, our hypothesis are as following:

1. As inject only indocyanine green (ICG), it provide the surgeon visual guidance to ensure better outcome.
2. indocyanine green (ICG) permitted accurate preoperative and intraoperative detection of the SLNs as well as nonpalpable benign brest lesion in patients with breast cancer.
Benign Breast Neoplasm
non-palpable lesion localization rate, non-palpable lesion localization rate = number of patients complete excision of lesion / 20 enrolled patients, up to 6month
lesion of resection size, completeness of resection, actual lesion of width\*height\*length / resection lesion of width\*height\*length, up to 6month
physical assess, number of patients with pigmented skin lesion, number of patients with complication, number of patients with breast lymphedema, number of patients with residual breast lesion using breast ultrsound, following up a week to 6 month
Indocyanine green, ICG (ICG-fluorescence)

* ICG is the most commonly used fluorophore which approve by FDA.
* NIR-F imaging with ICG could be used in various surgeries. For example, SLN mapping in breast cancer and localization of liver metastasis, especially superficial lesion
* Contains sodium iodide, patients who have history of allergy to iodides should be used as caution.

Nonpalpable benign brest lesion localization

* New method for the localization and resection of non-palpable breast lesions.
* The breast lesion was correctly localized, and the area of ICG corresponded well to the site of the lesions.
