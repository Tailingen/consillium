Prophylactic Peptide Vaccine in Advanced ALK+ NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a cancer peptide vaccine to prevent or delay acquired resistance in advanced ALK+ lung cancer patients currently on ALK targeted therapy.
NSCLC Stage IV|ALK Fusion Protein Expression
BIOLOGICAL: Peptide vaccine
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, The safety of administering the ALK peptide vaccine will be assessed by the occurrence of the following adverse events:

* Grade 3 or above drug-related toxicities
* Drug-related toxicity by grade
* Vaccine site reactions after vaccine injections
* Immune-related adverse events (AEs)
* Unacceptable toxicities
* Treatment-emergent changes from normal to abnormal values in key laboratory parameters, Up to 2 years|Vaccine-specific immune response, Vaccine-specific response will be evaluated by the fold change in interferon-producing mutant-ALK-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in the peripheral blood., Up to 2 years
