IMA401 TCERÂ® in Recurrent and/or Refractory Solid Tumors, Alone or in Combination With a Checkpoint Inhibitor
Primary objective:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for extension for IMA401 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab

Secondary objectives:

* To characterize the safety and tolerability of IMA401 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab
* To evaluate initial anti-tumor activity of IMA401 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab
* To describe the pharmacokinetics of IMA401 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab
