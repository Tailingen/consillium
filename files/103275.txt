A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Initial Efficacy of Recombinant Human Anti-cluster Differentiation Antigen 47 (CD47) Monoclonal Antibody Injection (IBI188) in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors and Lymphomas
This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced malignancies.
Advanced Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: IBI188
Number of patients with AEs and SAEs, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI188 \[Adverse events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) \], 2 years
Pharmacokinetics: AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration, up to 2 years after enrollment|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax, Maximum concentration(Cmax) of the drug after administration, up to 2 years after enrollment|Immunogenicity: Percentage of ADA positive patients, Number of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) positive patients will be counted and percentage of ADA positive patients will be calculated to evaluate immunogenicity of IBI188., up to 2 years after enrollment|Preliminary anti-tumor activity of IBI188 (Objective Response Rate), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by iRECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors and Lugano2014 criteria for lymphoma., up to 2 years after enrollment
The study is composed of two stages: Part 1 Accelerated Titration Phase and Part 2 Dose Escalation Phase with initial fixed priming dose.

The starting dose for part 1 is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 2 dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg QW and 1 mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 28 days.

Part 2 will have 4 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW、10mg/kg QW、20mg/kg QW and 30mg/kg QW). Conventional 3+3 Dose Escalation will be adopted. DLT observation period is 28 days.
