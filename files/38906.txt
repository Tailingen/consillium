Study of RP-3500 (Camonsertib) With Niraparib or Olaparib in Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of niraparib or olaparib in combination with RP-3500 (camonsertib), in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib, examine pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess anti-tumor activity.
Advanced Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: RP-3500 (camonsertib)
Phase Ib - Safety and Tolerability of niraparib or olaparib in combination with RP-3500 (camonsertib) by assessing the grade and frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events., To determine the safety and tolerability of niraparib or olaparib in combination with RP-3500 (camonsertib) in patients with advanced solid tumors by assessing the grade and frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events, Up to 30 days after last administration of study intervention|Primary Phase 1b - Define Maximum Tolerated Dose of RP-3500-03 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib and Recommended Phase 2 Dose and preferred schedule by assessing frequency of Dose Limiting Toxicities observed at each dose level, To define the Maximum Tolerated Dose of RP-3500-03 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib and determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose and preferred schedule by assessing the frequency of Dose Limiting Toxicities observed at each dose level, At the end of cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 or 28 days)|Primary Phase 2 - Assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of RP-3500 (camonsertib) with niraparib or olaparib in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors, To preliminarily assess the antitumor activity of RP-3500 (camonsertib) with niraparib or olaparib in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors by Response evaluation criteria (RECIST 1.1 CA-125 per GCIG, and PSA per PCWG3), While on study therapy, every 6 weeks for first 5 months and then every 9 weeks thereafter
To assess PK parameters of RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib -Cmax, To assess plasma concentrations of RP-3500 (camonsertib) and niraparib or olaparib with calculations of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Through Cycle 1 and 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|To assess PK parameters of RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib -Tmax, To assess plasma concentrations of RP-3500 (camonsertib) and niraparib or olaparib with calculations of time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), Through Cycle 1 and 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|To assess PK parameters of RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib - AUC, To assess plasma concentrations of RP-3500 (camonsertib) and niraparib or olaparib with calculations of area under the plasma concentration-time curve 0-6 hours post dose (AUC0-6)., Through Cycle 1 and 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a first-in-human Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to:

* Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 (camonsertib) when administered orally in combination with niraparib or olaparib to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule.
* Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib
* Assess anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib
* Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 (camonsertib) treatment in combination with niraparib or olaparib.

After the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with niraparib or olaparib will be enrolled to study the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD).
