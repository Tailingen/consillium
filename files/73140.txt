Dose Escalation and Expansion of BBO-10203 in Advanced Solid Tumors (BREAKER-101)
First in human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BBO-10203, a PI3KÎ±:RAS breaker, alone and in combination with trastuzumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1a/1b study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, and PK of BBO-10203 as a single agent and in combination with trastuzumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic (ie, advanced) solid tumors. The study includes a dose escalation phase, and an expansion phase.
