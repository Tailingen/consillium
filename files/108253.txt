Brain Metastases in Norway - A Prospective Cohort Study
The overall aim and primary outcome of this study will be a descriptive analysis of the current treatment practice of BM in Norway. Specifically, it may give answers to the following research questions:

* What is the true incidence of BM in Norway?
* How are patients with BM treated at present?
* Do treatments differ between hospitals?
* How do treatments impact quality of life of the patients?
* Which factors (treatment, tumor and host variables) can explain disease control, survival, symptom relief, and general functions?
* How can BM staging be improved?
Brain Metastases
Overall survival after diagnosis of brain metastases, Calculation of the overall survival times for each patient enrolled, Time from diagnosis of brain metastases till death of any cause, assessed up to 12 months
Treatment offered to patients diagnosed with brain metastases, Description of treatment offered, 3 years|Changes in patient reported symptoms and quality of life items through EORTC questionnaire QLQ PAL15 and submodule BN20, Description of changes in patient reported outcomes through standardized questionnaires.European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients receiving palliative care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), covers items such as pain, physical and emotional functioning. The QLQ-BN20 contains questions on 7 single-item symptom scales (headaches, seizures, drowsiness, hair loss, itchy skin, leg weakness, and bladder control), and 4 multi-item scales (future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit). Patient's scores are translated into a scale from 1-100. A change of 10 points in one item is considered clinically significant., Monthly up to 12 months after inclusion
