An Exploratory Study of ctDNA-MRD in Predicting the Efficacy of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the correlation between ctDNA-MRD and the therapeutic effect and prognosis of stage II-IVA operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus
Progression-free survival, Evaluation of progression-free survival rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with different MRD status during perioperative period, up to 2 year
ESCC patients with II-IVA resection will undergo MRD examination at the following time: the first examination is before the operation, the second examination is 7-10 days after the operation, and then 1 month after the operation, 2 weeks after the end of adjuvant treatment (if available), the follow-up period (every 3 months if there is no postoperative treatment) and the progress (the progress of the disease confirmed by the researcher), the patients will receive close MRD monitoring to evaluate the correlation between ctDNA-MRD and therapeutic efficacy and prognosis.
