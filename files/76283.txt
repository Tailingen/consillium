A Study of Rocbrutinib in Participants with Relapse or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center Phase 2 study of oral Rocbrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are failed or relapsed after remission or intolerated to Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
DRUG: Rocbrutinib
Overall Response Rate, To assess the anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by Independent Reading Committee (IRC)., Up to 24 Months
Overall Response Rate, To assess the anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator., Up to 24 Months|Complete remission rate, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on complete remission rate (CR) as assessed by investigator and IRC., Up to 24 Months|Progression Free Survival, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator and IRC., Measured from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of earliest disease progression or death or last visit, and assessed up to 24 months.|Overall survival, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on Overall survival (OS) as assessed by investigator and IRC., Measured from the date of date of first dose to the date of death or last visit, and for up to 5 years after the last subject is enrolled.|Duration of Response (DOR), To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the Investigator and IRC., Measured from the date of the first remission to the date of earliest disease progression or death, and assessed up to 24 months.|Time to Response (TTR), To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Rocbrutinib based on Time to response (TTR) as assessed by the Investigator and IRC., Measured from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of earliest response, and assessed up to 6 months.|Safety Assessment, To evaluate the safety of Rocbrutinib by assessing incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events as determined by CTCAE v5.0, From first dose of study drug to 28 days after last dose of study drug|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK) As Assessed By Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of Rocbrutinib, Up to 24 hours post dose|Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To The Time Of The Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t), PK As Assessed By Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To The Time Of The Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t) of Rocbrutinib, Up to 24 hours post dose|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), PK As Assessed By Time To Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) Of Rocbrutinib, Up to 24 hours post dose|Half-life period (T1/2), PK As Assessed By Time To Half-life period (T1/2) Of Rocbrutinib, Up to 24 hours post dose|Quality of life (QoL), Quality of life Assessed By the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire (The total score ranges from 30 to126, Items 29 and 30 are scored from 1 to 7 points, and other items are scored from 1 to 4 points. Except for items 29 and 30, the higher value, the worse QoL.), Up to 24 Months
