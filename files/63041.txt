A Trial of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Stage III NSCLC (KEYNOTE-799, MK-3475-799)
This is a trial in adult participants with unresectable, locally advanced, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy and standard thoracic radiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab monotherapy. The primary hypothesis of the trial is that within each platinum doublet chemotherapy cohort, the percentage of participants who develop Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis is ≤10% and estimation of objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab 200 mg|DRUG: Paclitaxel 45 mg/m^2|DRUG: Carboplatin AUC6|DRUG: Cisplatin 75 mg/m^2|DRUG: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2|RADIATION: Thoracic Radiation Therapy (TRT)|DRUG: Paclitaxel 200 mg/m^2|DRUG: Carboplatin AUC2
Percentage of Participants Who Developed Grade 3 or Higher Pneumonitis, Pneumonitis included the MedDRA preferred terms for radiation pneumonitis are acute interstitial pneumonitis, autoimmune lung disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, organizing pneumonia, and immune-mediated pneumonitis. As per common terminology criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, pneumonitis was graded as follows: Grade (Gr) 1- asymptomatic, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; Gr 2- symptomatic, medical intervention indicated, limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); Gr 3- severe symptoms; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL), oxygen indicated; Gr 4- life-threatening respiratory compromise; urgent intervention indicated (e.g., tracheotomy or intubation); Gr 5- death., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) and was assessed using modified RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to approximately 3 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by BICR per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). Disease progression was defined as at least 20 percent (%) increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters \[mm\]) in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was estimated and analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 5 1/2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause. OS was estimated and analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 5 1/2 years|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants with at least one AE was assessed., Up to approximately 1 1/2 years|Number of Participants Who Discontinued From Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinued treatment due to an AE was assessed., Up to approximately 1 year
