A Study of ABP 215 Versus Bevacizumab in Chinese Subjects With Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ABP 215 compared to Bevacizumab in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Approximately 170 subjects will be randomized 1:1 in approximately 40 sites in China. This study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a treatment period of 18 weeks, and an end of study visit 3 weeks after the last dose of investigational product or study-specified chemotherapy. After randomization, subjects will receive investigational product at a dose of 15 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by at least 4 and no more than 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy every 3 weeks.
