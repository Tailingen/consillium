Pilot Study of Allogeneic Tumor Cell Vaccine With Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib in Patients Undergoing Resection of Lung and Esophageal Cancers, Thymic Neoplasms, and Malignant Pleural Mesotheliomas
Background:

- Certain types of lung, esophageal, or thymic cancers and mesotheliomas have specific antigens (protein molecules) on their surfaces. Research studies have shown that giving a vaccine that contains antigens similar to these may cause an immune response, which may keep tumors from growing. Researchers are also interested in determining whether the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide and the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib may help the vaccine work better, particularly in patients with lung cancer.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines in combination with cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in patients with cancers involving the chest.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had surgery for small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, and malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Design:

* Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, participants will have leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes (white blood cells) for testing.
* Participants will receive celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home, 7 days before the vaccine.
* Participants will have the vaccine in the clinical center (one or two shots per month for 6 months), and will stay in the clinic for about 4 hours after the vaccine. Participants will keep a diary at home of any side effects from the vaccine, and will continue to take cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.
* One month after the sixth vaccine, participants will provide another blood sample for testing, and if the tests are satisfactory will return to the clinic every 3 months for 2 additional vaccines.
* Participants will return to clinic for follow-up physical examinations, lab tests, and scans every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

Tabulation of toxicity type and grade, If 25 patients are enrolled and the true probability of a grade 3 or worse toxicity (of any sort) were 20%, then the probability of having 4 or more patients with this occurring is 76.6%. On the other hand, if the combination was very safe and the true probability of a grade 3 or worse toxicity was 5%, then the probability of having 4 or more patients with this occurring would be 3.4%. Thus, if 25 patients were treated, the combination may be considered to have potentially lower safety than tolerable if 4 or more patients experience grade 3 or worse toxicity., 2 years
To ascertain if K526-GM vaccines induce immunity to CT antigens commonly expressed in thoracic malignancies., Perform exploratory analyses which investigate immunologic responses to a panel of CT antigens in vaccinated patients., 2 years|To determine if metronomic oral CP and celecoxib reduce the number, percentage and function of CD4+ CD25+ Fox P3+ regulatory T cells (T reg) in peripheral blood of thoracic oncology patients., Measure T regulatory cells at baseline and at the conclusion of treatment. The difference, or the relative difference, in the values at the two time points will be obtained, and tested to determine if the difference is equal to zero. If a paired t-test is able to be used, with at least 20 evaluable patients, there is 81% power to detect a change equal to 3/4ths of a standard deviation of the change at the two-sided 0.025 significance level., 2 years
Background:

During recent years, the cancer-testis (CT) antigens have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas lung and esophageal cancers, as well as malignant pleural mesotheliomas express a variety of CT antigens, immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in patients with these malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Our published studies indicate that numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with allogeneic tumor cells expressing high levels of multiple CT antigens in combination with depletion of T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with lung and esophageal cancers, thymic neoplasms, primary thoracic sarcomas, and malignant pleural mesotheliomas will be vaccinated with irradiated K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing GM-CSF (K562-GM) following completion of appropriate combined modality therapy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7dq 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CT antigens as well as cell-mediated recognition of autologous tumor cells and EBVtransformed B cells will be assessed before and after vaccination.

Objective:

-To assess the safety of K562-GM allogeneic tumor cell vaccines in combination with oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in thoracic oncology patients.

Eligibility:

* Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, primary thoracic sarcomas, and malignant pleural mesothelioma with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease (MRD) in the primary site following standard multimodality therapy.
* Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2, without evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted; pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination commences.
* Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of \<1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.

Design:

* Following recovery from standard combined modality therapy, patients with no evidence of disease or minimal residual disease will be vaccinated via subcutaneous intradermal injection with 1x10(8) irradiated K562-GM-tumor cells periodically over 6 months. Sterility, potency and identity of the vaccines preps will be confirmed before administration.
* Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.
* Systemic toxicities, and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post vaccination serologic responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as cell mediated responses to epigenetically-modified autologous EBV-transformed B and autologous tumor cells (if available) will be assessed before and after vaccination.
* Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.
* Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.
* As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than definitive.
* Approximately 25 patients will be accrued to this trial.
