BrECADD Therapy in Stage 2 B-IV Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to further assess the efficacy and tolerability of a regimen of Brentuximab Vedotin, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Dacarbazine, and Dexamethasone (BrECADD) in patients with Stage 2 B-IV Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) with an exploratory objective to assess the clinical utility of Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for minimal residual disease (MRD) and depth of treatment response.

Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of treatment until disease progression or death, whichever is earlier. Follow-up times for participants who remain alive without progression will be censored at the last documented disease assessment date., Up to 12 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of treatment until disease progression or death, whichever is earlier. Follow-up times for participants who remain alive without progression will be censored at the last documented disease assessment date., Up to 24 months|Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs), The number of treatment-related AEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0. Standard definitions for seriousness will be applied., Up to 40 months|Number of Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The number of treatment-related SAEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0. Standard definitions for seriousness will be applied., Up to 40 months|Percentage of Participants With Toxicity Throughout BrECADD Measured by PRO-CTCAE, Toxicity will be measured by the percentage of participants using the Participant Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). This criteria is a measurement system designed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to capture and evaluate the symptomatic side effects experienced by cancer patients during clinical trials, allowing patients to self-report on the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptoms like pain, fatigue, nausea, and skin reactions, providing a more patient-centric perspective on treatment toxicity compared to clinician-based assessments alone., Up to 40 months|Percentage of Participants With Toxicity Throughout BrECADD measured by FRAIL, Toxicity will be measured by the percentage of participants using the Fatigue, Resistance, Aerobic Capacity, Illnesses and Loss of Weight (FRAIL) questionnaire.

The FRAIL scale (short five-questions assessment of fatigue, resistance, aerobic capacity, illnesses and loss of weight) classified the patients into three categories: robust (score=0), pre-frailty (score=1-2), and frailty (score=3-5), Up to 40 months
