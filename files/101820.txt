Lymph Node Mapping in Patients With Endometrial Cancer
This clinical trial studies lymph node mapping in patients with endometrial cancer. Lymph node mapping may allow for limited removal of lymph nodes in as part of endometrial cancer staging and treatment.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: sentinel lymph node detection|DRUG: indocyanine green solution|DRUG: isosulfan blue|PROCEDURE: sentinel lymph node biopsy
Negative Predictive Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Prediction of Metastatic Disease, NPV is found by dividing the number of true negatives by the number of all patients without pelvic lymph node metastases. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the proportions will be calculated., average of 1-14 days after the procedure when final pathologic evaluation has been completed
Percentage of Metastatic Cases Found Using Ultra-sectioning and IHC Staining, The percentage of metastatic cases analyzed by H\&E will be compared to those of H\&E-plus- IHC/ultrastaging using a "z-test"., average of 1-14 days after the procedure when final pathologic evalulation has been completed
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate the negative predictive value of pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) in endometrial cancer to predict nodal metastasis.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

II. To examine the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of metastatic disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by comparing IHC results and standard hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) results.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo sentinel lymph node detection using fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green solution and isosulfan blue and sentinel lymph node biopsy and detection of sentinel lymph nodes is noted in the within 30 minutes of injection of the dye, followed by full pelvic lymph node dissection and aortic lymph node dissection as indicated, and standard hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years for a total of 5 years according to the standard surveillance guidelines for endometrial cancer.
