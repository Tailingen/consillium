A Study of Carboplatin and Gemcitabine Plus Bevacizumab in Patients With Ovary, Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Carcinoma
This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter Phase III study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab, administered in combination with carboplatin with gemcitabine, in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Investigator, Per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression (PD), as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started; the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; and/or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks., From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)
Percentage of Patients With an Objective Response as Determined by the Investigator, Per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), An objective response was the occurrence of either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. CR: The disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks., From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)|Duration of Objective Response (OR) as Determined by the Investigator, Per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), Duration of OR was analyzed in the subset of patients who achieved an OR. The duration of OR was defined as the time from the initial CR or PR until documented PD or death. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks., From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., From randomization through July 19, 2013 (up to 6 years, 3 months)|Percentage of Patients Who Had a Gastrointestinal Perforation (GIP), A gastrointestinal perforation is a hole that develops through the entire wall of the stomach, small intestine, large bowel, or gallbladder., From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)|Percentage of Patients Who Had at Least 1 Adverse Event, From randomization through July 19, 2013 (up to 6 years, 3 months)
