Evaluating Impact of Near Infrared Autofluorescence (NIRAF) Detection for Identifying Parathyroid Glands During Parathyroidectomy
This study will see if the use of near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with an FDA-cleared device 'Parathyroid Eye (PTeye)' for identifying parathyroid glands (PGs) during parathyroidectomy (PTx) procedures is better than a surgeon's detection alone. It compares risk-benefits and outcomes in PTx patients where NIRAF detection with PTeye for parathyroid identification is either used or not used.
