Pembrolizumab With and Without Radiotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized single-institution, phase II, open-label clinical trial of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with or without low-dose stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in stage I-IIIA non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are planned to undergo surgical resection of their lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT)|PROCEDURE: Surgery (Non-interventional, standard of care)
Change in the Mean Number of Infiltrating Absolute Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3+) T Cells/ μm2, The primary endpoint for this study is the change in the mean number of infiltrating CD3+ T cells/ μm2 in the lung cancer tissue from before and after pembrolizumab +/- SRT by group, based on quantification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and image analysis by group., Up to 1 year|Percentage of Participants Achieving a Two-fold Increase CD3+ T Cells/μm2, The percentage of participants achieving a two-fold increase from baseline in CD3+ T cells/μm2 will be reported. The goal of achieving a two-fold increase in 40 percent (%) of the evaluable population is a reasonable one, as estimated from a previous study showing greater-than-three-fold increase in 57% of patients when CD3+ T cells/μm2 were measured in prostate cancer tissue treated with a cell- based cancer immunotherapy., Up to 1 year
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4 including immune-related AEs will be considered treatment related, Up to 1 year|Percentage of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Immune-related AEs, Immune-related Adverse events with a Grade of 3 or higher according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 will be reported, Up to 1 year|Median Overall Survival in Months, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment initiation until death in months with the median and full range reported. Participants lost to follow-up will be censored at the last study visit where survival data was obtained, and those still alive at 12 months will be censored., Up to 1 year|Median Relapse Free Survival, Relapse free survival is defined as the time from treatment initiation until documented disease progression, in months, with the median and full range reported. Participants who have not progressed at the end of 12 months will be censored to the last study visit., Up to 1 year|Percentage of Participants With Distant Metastases, The percentage of participants who demonstrated distant metastases at 12 months will be reported, Up to 1 year|Percentage of Participants Determined to Have Unresectable Tumors After Progression, The percentage of participants with demonstrated progression that were determined to have tumor unresectability following the preoperative program will be reported., Up to 1 year
Two consecutive run-in cohorts will administer pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab with SRT of 12 Gy to the lateral aspect of the primary tumor. Patients will receive pembrolizumab for 2 cycles prior to surgery or SRT and surgery. Surgical resection of all involved areas of tumor will occur within 6 weeks of the last administration of pembrolizumab. It should be noted that surgery is expected to occur within a much shorter window and 6 weeks would represent the greatest allowable amount of delay.

If during the run-in, only the pembrolizumab-alone cohort meets pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter a larger expansion cohort, with treatment given according to that cohort only. If during the run-in both cohorts meet pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter the expansion cohort and be randomized between preoperative pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab with SRT of 12 Gy.
