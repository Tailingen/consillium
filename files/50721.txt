Assessment of Cardiac Autonomic Function in Adulthood After Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy in Childhood
The SALTO-SNA study is an ancillary study of the SALTO study (Suivi À Long Terme en Oncologie des enfants guéris d'un cancer pédiatrique en régions Rhône-Alpes et Auvergne) coordinated by Dr. Claire Berger, pediatric oncologist at the CHU, Saint Etienne. It aims at re-examining, in their initial treatment center, all patients (a cohort of 495 patients alive in 2011), diagnosed between 1987 and 1992, and cured of childhood cancer (except leukemia) in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions.

The rationale for this study is based on the observation that although the survival rate of childhood cancers has now reached 75%, complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are high and greatly increase the risk of mortality in later years (estimated to be 14% in the literature).

The morbidity risk of chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be quantified by assessing the activity of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic regulation, which represents a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity to the individual.

OTHER: Autonomic nervous system activity records
Autonomic nervous system activity, The autonomic status will be classified in sympatho-vagal equilibrium as "normal", "altered" or "severely abnormal" according to the values obtained for some temporal indices (SDNN, SDaNN, RMSSD etc. ..) and frequencies (Ptot, HF, LF , VLF, ratio LF / HF) compared to validated standards for the age (mean +/- standard deviation)., 15 years after the end of the cancer treatment
Doses of radiotherapy, Regarding radiotherapy, the doses of different vital organs of the body (151 anatomic sites) will be estimated from the radiotherapy technical records with the help of the Dos-EG software proposed by the INSERM team of F De Vathaire., 15 years after the end of the cancer treatment
For this purpose, analysis of the cardiac RR variability is a reliable, non-invasive and reproducible system that could be used in this population as a tool for early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction.
