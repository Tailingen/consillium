Development of Organoids From Primary Colorectal Tumors and Synchronous Liver Metastases
Pilot feasibility study for the development of organoids from primary colorectal tumors and synchronous liver metastases, to prepare organoids from primary colorectal tumors and synchronous liver metastases. The organoids will allow us to study the function of genes targeted by the activity of the NF-Y/p53 complex.
Colo-rectal Cancer
Descriptive analyses, Given the pilot nature of the study, we will only perform descriptive analyses, overexpression or silencing experiments of target genes of the NF-Y/p53 complex activity. These experiments will indicate the impact on the viability of the organoid of target genes of the NF-Y/p53 complex activity. All the variables of interest will be summarized through absolute frequencies and percentages, if categorical or through medians and relative range, if continuous., 36 months
Organoids will allow us to study the function of genes that are targets of the NF-Y/p53 complex activity. In these organoids, we will perform overexpression and/or silencing of these genes and assays of proliferation, invasion and motility. We will also perform functional assays in cocultures of the organoids with PBMCs from the same patients. This could allow the discovery of new pathways that could be targeted by targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy. Organoid preparation will be performed from fresh colorectal cancer tissue and liver metastasis following enzymatic digestion. Organoid culture medium and specific organic matrix will be used
