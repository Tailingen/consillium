Phase I Clinical Study for Evaluation of Pharmacokinetic, Safety, Tolerance of Norcantharidin Lipid Microsphere for Injection in Patients With Solid Tumor
This study was designed as a single-center, open, non-randomized trial.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Norcantharidin Lipid Microsphere for Injection|DRUG: Sodium Demethylcantharidate Injection
Cmax, Obtain directly according to the measured data of blood drug concentration-time., ±1 minute|AUC 0-t, The area under the curve from the time of administration to the lowest detectable blood concentration: calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule., ±1 minute|AUC 0-∞, Area under the curve from administration to extrapolation to infinity: AUC0-∞=AUC0-t+Ct/λz, Ct is the last measurable concentration, and λz is the elimination rate constant., ±1 minute
In this study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were enrolled for a tolerance test and a pharmacokinetic study. The dosage increment principle of 3+3 was adopted. At the end of the tolerance test, 3 dose groups (low, medium and high) were selected to conduct pharmacokinetic studies after evaluation by the researchers on the premise of good safety, and at least 8 patients were included in each group for PK study (at least 8 patients in each group could be evaluated for PK ).

After the end of the experimental drug tolerance and pharmacokinetics study, the safety and pharmacokinetics of single dose administration were compared with that of sodium norcantharidate for injection in the dose range of clinical use.
