Second-line Systemic Therapy Combined with SBRT for HCC with Oligoprogression After Standard First-line Systemic Treatment
Approximately 70% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, with no opportunity for curative treatments. For these patients, systemic therapies are the main treatment modalities. However, the objective response rates of first-line systemic treatments are currently only 20-35%, and most patients inevitably develop drug resistance and disease progression during treatment, thus taking second-line therapies. Second-line treatment options include regorafenib, pembrolizumab, and others, but clinical studies have shown a median progression-free survival of only 2.6-3.1 months, indicating an urgent need to improve efficacy.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been widely used in recent years for curative treatment of early-stage liver cancer or as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with portal vein tumor thrombus. It is one of the important approaches in the multidisciplinary management of HCC. Researches have shown that SBRT has a synergistic effect with systemic drug therapy, potentially enhancing the efficacy of targeted and immunotherapies. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled phase II clinical trial in patients with oligoprogressive HCC after standard first-line systemic treatment to evaluate whether adding SBRT to second-line systemic therapy can improve the efficacy of second-line treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and treatment-related adverse events. We aim to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of combining SBRT with second-line systemic therapy in treating oligoprogressive HCC patients.
