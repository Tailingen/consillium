Study Using Genomic, Histologic and Radiomic Analysis to Evaluate Regional Tumor Heterogeneity in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
Glioblastomas (GBM) demonstrate in vivo genetic and histologic heterogeneity that can be non-invasively identified using imaging phenotypes that identify regionally distinct areas of tumor with genetic alterations that drive tumor resistance pathways. The researchers propose a unique approach to assess initial GBM heterogeneity by performing histological and genomic analysis of biopsies targeted by advanced MRI before treatment.
