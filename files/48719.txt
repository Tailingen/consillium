Effectiveness of Myofascial Release Versus Manual Lymphatic Drainage After Breast Cancer Surgery
Objective. To compare the effectiveness of myofascial therapy against manual lymphatic drainage in the reduction of sequelae secondary to conservative surgery and radiotherapy in women who survived breast cancer.

Design. Randomized clinical trial. Site. Faculty of Physiotherapy of the University of Valencia. Participants. Twenty-four patients were included in the study. Interventions. 13 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with myofascial therapy and 11 to receive manual lymphatic drainage.

Main measurements. Pain measured using the Visual Analogue Scale, shoulder joint range, shoulder functionality using the DASH questionnaire, quality of life assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, and the depressed status of the patients using the PHQ-9 . All of this was assessed before and after treatment, and one month later as follow-up.

Pain, The Visual Analog Scale (EVA) was used. This scale consists of marking on a horizontal line of 10 cm in length VAS is a 10-point rating scale (0 = absolute discomfort and 10 = full comfort)., 2 months
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast, Consists of 36 items separated into two components: a general one formed by the first 27 items, and a specific one related to the symptoms of breast cancer constituted by the remaining 9 items. The survey represents five domains: physical well-being (7 items), social and family welfare (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items) and a specific subscale related to breast cancer and its treatment., 2 months|Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast (FACT-B).

It consists of 30 items, which assess situations of daily life and the patient responds by giving a score to each item that ranges from 1 "no difficulty", 2 "Little difficulty", 3 "Moderate difficulty", 4 "Very difficult" and 5 "Unable"., 2 months|Joint mobility, The measurement of the angular travel of all the movements of the shoulder was evaluated through a universal goniometer which proved to be a valid and reliable instrument., 2 months|Depressive state, Evaluated using the patient's health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). It consists of 9 items that assess the presence of depressive symptoms during the last two weeks. The score range is 0-27, each item ranges from 0 (never) to 3 (more than half the days)., 2 months
