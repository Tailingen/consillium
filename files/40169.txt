MR Elastography Parameters Impact on MR-HIFU Efficacy in Uterine Fibroids
Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for fibroids is an outpatient approach for controlling symptom with an excellent safety record. It is important to exclude in advance patients who would not benefit from this treatment. For that purpose this study assesses the influence of fibroid elasticity and diffusion on ablation efficiency during treatment by MR-HIFU
Uterine Fibroid
DEVICE: Myoma elastography
Composite criteria, Composite criteria measured from:

* myoma stiffness (measured by Resoundant system) and
* ablathermy efficiency., Baseline
leiomyoma stiffness measured by Resoundant system, leiomyoma stiffness measured by Resoundant system, Baseline|leiomyoma stiffness measured by ARFI-US, leiomyoma stiffness measured by ARFI-US, Baseline|clinical efficiency, Defined as a decrease of 10pts on UFS-Qol score, month 6|inter-observer reproducibility, inter-observer reproducibility of leiomyoma stiffness measurements by Resoundant system, Baseline|leiomyoma perfusion, leiomyoma perfusion (diffusion), Month 6|leiomyoma T2 signal, It will be evaluated in two ways:

The first consists of a qualitative analysis taking as a reference the signal of the paravertebral muscles. Myomas will then be classified into a hypersignal, iso-signal or hyposignal group as compared to muscles (qualitative method according to the classification of Funaki).

The second will be a quantitative method. One ROI will be positioned in the myoma and a second in the paravertebral muscle and the ratio of these values will be recorded., Month 6
Pre-procedural predictors of treatment efficacy will be useful for excluding in advance patients who would not get benefit of this treatment. It seems that elastography, cellular density and perfusion could be considered as predictors. Fibroid elastography will be quantified by MRE ResoundantÂ® system and pelvic ultrasound. Perfusion and cellular density will be quantified by MR diffusion.
