Characterization Phenotypic and Genetic Study of the Intestinal Epithelial Dysplasia or Tufting Enteropathy (TE)
This PHRC is centred on the intestinal epithelial dysplasia ( DEI) or " tufting enteropathy " or TE the clinical and histo-pathological descriptions of which are specified well to the digestive plan(shot).
Intestinal Epithelial Dysplasia|Tufting Enteropathy
GENETIC: blood samples and skin biopsies|GENETIC: Skin biopsies
gene identification, identification of different family of genes involved in intestinal dysplasia, 6 months
mutation identification, Identification of different mutations involved in intestinal dysplasia, 6 months
The objectives of this PHRC are:

* the phenotypic analysis of the intestinal epithelial dysplasia by clinical and histo-pathological investigations.
* the identification of proteins involved at the intestinal level in the differentiation, the proliferation and the membership of the epithelial cells
* from the phenotypic study, a genetic analysis of type maps by homozygote on the whole genome partner in an approach guided by possible candidate genes
* the study of the genes, chosen according to their location, to their profile of expression, and to their function in touch with the pathogenic hypotheses
