Abscopal Effect of Radiation in Combination With rhGM-CSF for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether radiation combined with recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) is safe and effective for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer Metastatic
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: rhGM-CSF
The abscopal effect rate, The proportion of patients with an abscopal response assessed after the initiation of treatment, up to 50 months
Progression free survival, From the date of enrollment to the date of progression or death, up to 84 months|Overall survival, From the date of enrollment to the date of death or last follow-up, up to 84 months
The prognosis of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was still poor for those unsuitable for target therapy or immunotherapy. This study is to include patients evaluated as effective or stable disease after first-line chemotherapy or progressed after second-line chemotherapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of receiving radiotherapy combined with recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF).
