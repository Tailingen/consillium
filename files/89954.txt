A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of Camizestrant (AZD9833) When Administered Alone and in Combination With Itraconazole
This study will be conducted in healthy post-menopausal female subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Camizestrant (AZD9833) when administered alone and in combination with Itraconazole.
Healthy Subjects
DRUG: Camizestrant|DRUG: Itraconazole
Area under plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity (AUCinf) of Camizestrant, To assess the effect of Itraconazole on AUCinf of Camizestrant., Day 1 to Day 4 (Period 1 and Period 3)|Area under the plasma concentration curve from zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of Camizestrant, To assess the effect of Itraconazole on AUClast of Camizestrant., Day 1 to Day 4 (Period 1 and Period 3)|Maximum observed plasma (peak) drug concentration (Cmax) of Camizestrant, To assess the effect of Itraconazole on Cmax of Camizestrant., Day 1 to Day 4 (Period 1 and Period 3)
Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Safety and tolerability of Camizestrant alone and in combination with Itraconazole will be assessed., From Screening (Day -28 to Day -2) up to follow-up visit (7 to 14 days after last Pharmacokinetic Sample) [approximately 9 weeks]|Number of subjects with adverse events leading to the discontinuation of study drug (DAEs), Number of subjects who discontinue the study drug due to adverse events will be assessed., From Day 1 (period 1) up to follow-up visit (7 to 14 days after last Pharmacokinetic Sample) [approximately 9 weeks]
This open-label, fixed sequence study will comprise of:

* A screening period of 28 days;
* A fixed sequence of three treatment period:

Treatment Period 1: Camizestrant only, Treatment Period 2: Itraconazole only, Treatment Period 3: Camizestrant and Itraconazole in combination.

â€¢ A Follow-up Visit at 7 to 14 days after the last Camizestrant PK sample in Period 3.

There will be a washout period of 7 to 10 days between Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 8 or 9 weeks.
