This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial to compare Billroth II reconstruction versus conventional Roux-en-Y reconstruction versus long limb Roux-en-Y reconstruction for glycemic control in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes and gastric cancer.

Billroth I, Billroth II, or Roux-en-Y procedure follows gastrectomy to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. Billroth I procedure restores the normal configuration of the gastrointestinal tract and Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure involve the creation of duodenal switch which is thought to be responsible for metabolic effects by altering enteric hormones. Accordingly, several retrospective studies reported that Billroth I reconstruction has less effect on diabetes compared to Billroth II and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. While little is known about different effects of Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure, a study retrospectively show that Roux-en-Y procedure has significantly higher rate of T2DM remission than Billroth II procedure. Investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial to control possible confounders arising from diverse metabolic effects of cancer and minimize differences in treatment regimen among patients.
