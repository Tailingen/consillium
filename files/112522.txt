Mammography, Early Detection Biomarkers, Risk Assessment, and Imaging Technologies, MERIT Study
This study collects mammogram images, blood samples, and clinical information from women undergoing routine screening mammograms. Creating a bank of blood samples and a database of clinical and risk information may be used in future research related to breast cancer, other cancers, and women's health.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Mammography|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Creation of a repository of blood specimens and database of imaging, clinical data, health measurements, and questionnaire data, 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish a longitudinal cohort (n=10,000) of women who undergo routine annual mammography screening with follow-up for at least five years for each study participant or until breast cancer diagnosis.

II. To create a repository of blood specimens from the cohort to use for biomarker discovery and validation.

III. To create a comprehensive integrated database of imaging, clinical data, health measurements, and questionnaire data on the study participants.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete questionnaires over 15-25 minutes about personal and family history of cancer, health status, breast cancer risk factors, diet, weight gain, and physical activity, and undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and then annually for 5 years. Participants also undergo standard of care mammography at baseline and then annually for 5 years.
