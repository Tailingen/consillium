Anrotenib Plus Toripalimab Versus Toripalimab in Patients With Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anrotenib plus toripalimab in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, the investigators will explore the possible mechanisms of anrotinib combined with toripalimab in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of combination therapy.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Anrotenib plus Toripalimab|DRUG: Toripalimab
Overall Survival (OS), From the first day of treatment to death or last survival confirm date, up to 2 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From the first day of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To compare objective response rate of the two arms from date of anti-cancer therapy until progression, up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To compare disease control rate of the two arms from date of anti-cancer therapy until progression, up to 2 years|Number of Participants with Treatment-related Adverse Events Treatment-related adverse events, Number of Participants with Treatment-related Adverse Events Treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by NCI CT CAE v5.0, up to 2 years|Assessment of Health-related quality of life, Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will be evaluated since treatment begins. At the end of the trail, the differences between the two indicators will be compared with Mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), where the baseline is scored as a covariant and the treatment group as a fixed variable. In addition, the baseline values of the two scores, the value of each visit, and the change value of the baseline will be statistically described., up to 2 years
There is no standard recommendation for the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer after chemotherapy failure. Anrotinib combined with triplizumab have showed synergistic effect in the tumor treatment, and they have demonstrated robust antitumor activity in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with negative driving gene. However, there is no related report on the efficacy in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anrotenib plus toripalimab in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, the investigators will explore the possible mechanisms of anrotinib combined with toripalimab in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of combination therapy.
