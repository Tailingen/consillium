Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Radiation Therapy Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB NSCLC
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility and efficacy of sequential neoadjuvant docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with operable stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.
* Determine the rate of event-free survival at 1 year in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the operability and complete resection rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the postoperative 30-day mortality in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the response rate, failure pattern, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Beginning 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, patients without progressive disease receive radiotherapy 1-2 times daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.

Patients undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.

Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
