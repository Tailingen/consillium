S-531011 as Monotherapy and in Combination With an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The primary objective of Part A is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-531011 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of S-531011.
