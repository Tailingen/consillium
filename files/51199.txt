Anlotinib Combined With Nivolumab for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of anlotinib in combination with nivilumab as second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS);the secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease progression or death from any cause., 6 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1). The percentage of patients who achieved CR and PR was defined as objective response rate (ORR), each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 12 months)|Disease control rate (DCR), Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1) and the percentage of patients who achieved CR, PR and SD was defined as disease control rate (DCR)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is calculated from diagnosis to death or last follow-up time., 12 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 30 day safety follow-up visit
