Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer With Different Biological Effective Doses
The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of SBRT in LAPC with different biological effective dose (BED) (60-70Gy Vs.\>70Gy ) , to identify a dose range that could achieve better survival benefit and minimize the toxicity of radiotherapy.
