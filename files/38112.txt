First-in-Human Study of BBT-207 in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring EGFR Mutation After Treatment With EGFR TKI
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy (antitumor activity) of BBT-207. It will consist of 3 parts; dose escalation, recommended phase 2 dose selection, and dose expansion.
