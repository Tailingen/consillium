Early Assessment of Ovarian Cancer Aggressiveness by Metabolic Imaging
To learn if an MRSI can be performed on a 3T scanner using an investigational contrast drug called hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate. 3T refers to the "strength" of the MRI machine.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 4.03, through study completion: an average of 5 years
Primary Objective:

1. To assess if increased lactate production measured by HP 13C MRI occurs in suspected ovarian cancer patients who will undergo surgery
2. To evaluate the proportion of increased lactate production in the ovaries measured by HP 13C MRI in low/high ovarian cancer risk patients.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Correlate HP-MR findings to metabolomics, immune profiles, and blood biomarkers of patients undergoing surgical resection.
2. Demonstrate the feasibility and utility of metabolic imaging with HP 13C pyruvate MR in patients with suspected ovarian cancer
3. Correlating imaging findings such as enhancement pattern, ADC values, and advanced image analytics such as texture with pathology and genetic analysis for patients who will undergo surgical resection.
