Safety Study of Cancer Specific Epitope Peptides Cocktail for Cervical, GI, and Lung Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacies of cyclophosphamide combined cancer specific epitope peptides cocktail for advanced/relapsed solid tumors including GI/lung/cervical cancers
Metastatic Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: 5 peptide vaccines of KOC1, TTK, CO16, DEPDC1, MPHOSPH1
safety of the cyclophosphamide combined tumor specific epitope peptide cocktail, 2 years
immunological efficacies and clinical efficacies of the cyclophosphamide combined tumor specific epitope peptides cocktail, 2.5 years
KOC1, TTK, CO16(URLC10), DEPDC1, MPHOSPH1 have been identified using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in the previous studies. The investigators have determined the HLA-A\*2402 restricted epitope peptides respectively derived from KOC1, TTK, CO16(URLC10), DEPDC1, and MPHOSPH1 showed strong INF-gamma production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressing the appropriate protein and HLA-A\*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after the vaccination. Therefore the investigators focused on the prevention of further expansion of the solid tumors highly expressing these 5 proteins using these 5 peptides.
