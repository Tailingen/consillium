Cost Effectiveness Of Sunitinib In Central America And Caribbean
Primary Hypothesis: The therapy with Sunitinib represents better cost-effectiveness than IFN-α in first-line treatment for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) in Central America and Caribbean countries
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
Rate of patients that present metastasis when consulting for first time, 9 months|Rate of use of Sutent, IFN-α and Bevacizumab + IFN-α as first-line treatment, 9 months|Hospitalization average with Sutent, with IFN-α, and with Bevacizumab + IFN-α, 9 months|Rate of success in first-line treatment with Sutent, in first-line treatment with IFN-α and in first-line treatment with Bevacizumab + IFN-α, 9 months|Average number of cycles of Sutent, IFN-α and Bevacizumab + IFN in first-line treatment, 9 months
Percentage of adverse effects with the use of Sunitinib, IFN-α and Bevacizumab + IFN, 9 months|Quality of life in patients using an approved quality questionnaire, 9 months|Costs-benefit of each treatment, 9 months|PFY (progression free years) with each treatment, 9 months|LY (life years) with each treatment, 9 months|QALYs (quality adjusted life years) with each treatment, 9 months|ICER (incremental cost effectiveness ratio) of PFY and LY with each treatment, 9 months
This study was terminated on 03Feb2011 due to the fact that the anticipated number of patients expected was not reached. The date of cessation of the drug was January 27, 2011. There was no intervention in the treatment or administration of the drug; the study only observed the treatment and collected data. As the study was dependent on the arrival of new patients with metastatic renal cancer, which was of a very low incidence, the study was terminated. Efficacy, adverse events or other safety issues were not factors in terminating the study. Lack of patients was the only reason.
