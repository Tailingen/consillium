GnRH Antagonist Versus GnRH Agonist in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome During in Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer
GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonists in IVF (in vitro fertilization) has been accomplished by several randomized controlled trials compared with conventional GnRH agonist long protocol in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Moreover, there are debating issues that refer to the timing of GnRH antagonist initiation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the laboratory and clinical priority during ovarian stimulation for IVF in patients with PCOS treated with three different protocols.

DRUG: GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix)|DRUG: Conventional GnRH agonist (Triptorelin)
number of oocyte retrieved, ovum pick up day, At the point of ovum pick-up, we can count how many oocyte was retrieved. So, almost just after ovum pick-up, outcome measure will be possible.
pregnancy rate, after confirming fetal heart beat via transvaginal ultrasound. Usually 2~4 weeks after ovum pick-up day.
