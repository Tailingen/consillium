Phase I Dose Escalation Trial of Efavirenz in Solid Tumours or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Therapeutic Failure.
Hypothesis: encouraging results of phase II study FAVE in the treatment of hormonal resistant prostate cancer lead us to continue clinical development of efavirenz. Furthermore, all available pre-clinical and clinical data lead us to conduct a Phase 1 study with efavirenz. Objective of this Phase I is to test doses above 600 mg / day in patients with cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose to improve therapeutic effect.

This study is a single center Phase I trial, conduct with dose escalation scheme of efavirenz by continual reassessment method likehood approach (CRML) on solid tumours (except pancreatic cancer) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Main objective is to determine the safety profile, and particularly the maximum tolerated dose of efavirenz for the treatment of patients with solid tumors (except pancreatic cancer) or NHL in therapeutic failure.

Secondary objectives are:

* Evaluate efavirenz pharmacokinetics at 2, 4 and 12 weeks;
* Evaluate objective response at 12 weeks;
* Evaluate progression free survival at 6 months;
* Assess biological progression-free survival at 6 months (prostate tumours only).

Primary Endpoint

Safety will be evaluated according to the toxicity scale NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Dose limiting toxicities will be collected during the first 28 days (+ / - 7 days) after first dose of Efavirenz and will be defined as follows:

* Any drug-related toxicity with grade ≥ 3 according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, regardless of grade),
* Any drug-related toxicity, regardless of grade, who led a treatment delay\> 14 days,
* Score ≥ 19 HAD during treatment. Secondary Criteria
* Solid tumors: response and progression defined by RECIST v1.1 \[Eisenhauer EA et al. EJC 2009).
* Non-Hodgkin lymphomas: Response and progression defined according to Cheson criteria \[Cheson BD et al. JCO 1999\]
* Biological progression (particular case of prostate tumors): defined according to Scher \[Scher HI et al. JCO 2008\] Statistical Considerations This is a Phase I dose escalation strategy using the method CRML, described by O'Quigley and Shen \[O'Quigley et al. Biometrics 1996\] and commonly used in Phase I trials in oncology.
* Maximum number of eligible and evaluable subjects is 30.
* Six dose levels are initially defined: 600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg, 2200 mg, 2600 mg, 3000 mg.
* The risk of dose limiting toxicities maximum allowed is 25%.
Solid Tumors|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Efavirenz 600mg|DRUG: Efavirenz 1200 mg|DRUG: Efavirenz 1800 mg|DRUG: Efavirenz 2200 mg
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Efavirenz, MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 3000 mg (oral daily intake).

The dose escalation scheme is the continual reassessment method likehood approach (CRML) described by O'Quigley and Shen \[O'Quigley et al. Biometrics 1996\].

MTD reflects the highest dose of drug that did not cause a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in \> 25% of participants.

A DLT was any drug-related toxicity with grade ≥ 3 according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, regardless of grade), any drug-related toxicity, regardless of grade, who led a treatment delay\> 14 days, a score ≥ 19 for the Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale (HAD) during treatment., Up to 28 days for each dosing cohort|Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was any drug-related toxicity with grade ≥ 3 according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, regardless of grade), any drug-related toxicity, regardless of grade, who led a treatment delay\> 14 days, a score ≥ 19 for the Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale (HAD) during treatment., Up to 28 days for each dosing cohort
12-week Objective Response Rate, Objective response is defined as complete or partial response (CR, PR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Objective reponse rate is calculated as the number of patients with objective reponse divided by the number of alive patients., up to 3 months after first adminitration of Efavirenz|12-week Non-progression Rate, Non progression is defined as complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Non-progression rate is calculated as the number of alive and progression free patients divided by the number of patients., Evaluated up to 3 months after first administration of Efavirenz
This is a Phase I dose escalation strategy according to the method described by CRML O'Quigley and Shen \[O'Quigley et al. Biometrics 1996\] and commonly used in phase I trials in oncology.

Six levels of doses are initially defined: 600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg, 2200 mg, 2600 mg, 3000 mg.

The maximum potential dose-limiting toxicities allowed is 25%.

Dose limiting toxicities will be defined as follows:

* Any drug-related toxicity with grade ≥ 3 according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting, regardless of grade),
* Any drug-related toxicity, regardless of grade, who led a treatment delay\> 14 days,
* Score ≥ 19 HAD during treatment.
