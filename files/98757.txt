Cardiovascular Health in Adult Patients With Cancer Exposed to Cardiotoxic Therapies
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the cardiovascular health and prognosis of adult patients with cancer, treated with cardiotoxic therapies.

The main purposes of the study are the following:

* Identify the demographic factors related to the onset of cardiotoxicity produced by anticancer drugs.
* Identify any subgroups more likely to develop distant major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
* Evaluate the usefulness of clinical, biohumoral and echocardiographic parameters for early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity.

Participants will be monitored during the anticancer treatment via clinical, laboratory and instrumental evaluation according to the recommendation of the current guidelines on Cardio-Oncology (European Society of Cardiology, 2022). Initial follow-up will be 2 years.

The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the cardiovascular health and prognosis of adult patients with cancer, exposed to potentially-cardiotoxic therapies.

The main purposes of the study are the following:

* Identify the demographic factors related to the onset of cardiotoxicity produced by anticancer drugs.
* Identify any subgroups of patients more likely to develop distant major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
* Evaluate the usefulness of clinical, bio-humoral and echocardiographic parameters for early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity.

Participants will be monitored during the anticancer treatment via clinical, laboratory and instrumental evaluation according to the recommendations of the available guidelines on Cardio-Oncology (European Society of Cardiology, 2022). Initial follow-up will be 2 years.
