Phase I Trial of Arsenic Trioxide and Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Recurrent Malignant Glioma
To investigate the safety of delivering arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination with stereotactic radiotherapy in recurrent malignant glioma by performing an open label, Phase I dose escalation trial. Results from this study will provide a basis for further study of ATO combined with radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer for malignant brain tumors in future Phase II studies.
