Study of MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) in Patients With Microsatellite Unstable (MSI) Tumors (Cohort D)
This study will be looking at whether MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with MSI (Microsatellite Unstable) negative cancer with a mutator phenotype.
High Tumor Mutation Burden|High TMB (Tumor Mutation Burden)|MSS (Microsatellite Stable)
DRUG: MK-3475
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Patients With MSI (Microsatellite Unstable)-Negative Solid Tumor Malignancies With a Mutator Phenotype, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions., 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of follow-up (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 80 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Patients Using RECIST 1.1(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of first dose to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 2 years|Number of Patients Experiencing a Grade 3 or Above Treatment-related Toxicity, When calculating the incidence of AEs, each adverse event (AE) (as defined by NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be counted only once for a given subject., 28 months
