Using Spectrally Encoded Confocal Microscopy (SECM) to Visualise the Esophagus Using an SECM Probe
The study is being done to test the feasibility and tolerability of a SECM imaging probe in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE).

Subjects will undergo SECM probe imaging while they are under conscious sedation. Spiral SECM imaging will be performed continuously over a pre-determined length. Patients will later be asked for their feedback.
Barrett's Esophagus
DEVICE: SECM Probe
Number of Participants With Tolerability of the Procedure, We were monitoring the number of participants able to tolerate the procedure. All six participating subjects have been asked for a feedback about tolerability of the procedure using a specific tolerability questionnaire., During the procedure
Subjects with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus will be recruited in the study and undergo SECM probe imaging while using conscious sedation, pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring. The probe will be inserted the predetermined required distance in the esophagus using a guide wire.

Once the SECM imaging probe is in place, spiral SECM image data will be continuously collected over a pre-determined length (approximately 5cm).
