Application of Perioperative Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Patients Undergoing Hepatectomy
Our primary aim is to investigate whether perioperative remote ischemic conditioning (PRIC) as an adjunctive treatment can improve postoperative recovery in patients undergoing hepatectomy as an adjunct to standard treatment.

Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) can be applied as repeated short-lasting ischemia in a distant tissue that results in protection against subsequent long-lasting ischemic injury in the target organ. This protection can be applied prior to or during a prolonged ischemic event as remote ischemic pre-conditioning (RIPreC) and per-conditioning (RIPerC), respectively, or immediate after reperfusion as remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPostC).

RIC is a non-pharmacologic and non-invasive treatment without noticeable discomfort, commonly achieved by inflation of a blood pressure cuff to induce 5-minute cycles of limb ischemia alternating with 5 minutes of reperfusion. However, whether perioperative remote ischemic conditioning (PRIC) can improve postoperative recovery in patients undergoing hepatectomy has never been investigated in a randomized controlled trial.
