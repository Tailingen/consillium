A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Early Efficacy of AVA6000 in Solid Tumours
This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 open-label, multicentre dose escalation study investigating AVA6000 monotherapy administered intravenously in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumours that are likely to be FAP positive. The study consists of an initial Phase 1a dose escalation portion and a subsequent Phase 1b dose expansion portion upon completion of the dose escalation portion.

Phase 1a (Dose Escalation): The dose-escalation portion is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and MTD and/or RP2D of AVA6000, administered as monotherapy in two schedules: Day 1 of a 21-day cycle (Q3W schedule) and Day 1 of a 14-day cycle (Q2W schedule).

Phase 1b (Dose Expansion): The dose-expansion arm is based on review of data in the dose escalation phase, with AVA6000 administered at the recommended dose for expansion.
