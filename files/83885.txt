A Study of APG-115 Alone or Combined With Azacitidine in Patients With AML, CMML, or MDS
This is a two Part study in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that will initially evaluate the safety and tolerability of APG-115 as a single agent in Part 1, followed by a combination of APG-115 + 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) in Part 2.

DRUG: APG-115|DRUG: 5-azacitidine
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Part I is to assess the safety and tolerability of APG-115 by assessing the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of APG-115. End points include: Incidence of DLTs during the first 3 weeks of treatment of each dose cohort; Severity and frequency of any adverse event(s) (AE) and serious adverse event(s) (SAE) based on NCI CTCAE 5.0, 28 days
Part 1: Dose escalation of APG-115 will use standard 3+3 design. APG-115 is administered orally once daily (QD) on Day 1-5 every 28-day cycle. The starting target dose is 100 mg (dose level; DL1) and will be increased in subsequent cohorts to 150 mg (DL2), 200 mg (DL3), and 250 mg (DL4), accordingly.

Part 2: Dose escalation of APG-115 in combination with 5-AZA will use standard 3+3 design. 5-AZA is administered at 75 mg/mË„2/d subcutaneously daily on Day 1-7 every 28 days.
