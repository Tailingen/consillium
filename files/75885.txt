To evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of HIPEC Combined With Sintilimab for Gastric Cancer Patients with Peritoneal Metastasis.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: HIPEC,anti-PD-1 antibody Sintilimab (Tyvyt®), Chemotherapy,Surgery
R0 resection, the rate of R0 resection, 3 months
Overall survival time, Overall survival time(OS) refers to the time of first use of the drug to the time of death. At the end of the study, if the subject is still alive, refer the known "date of last survival of the subject" as the date of censoring., 2 years|ORR, Objective response rate(ORR): ORR = (number of subjects with complete response (CR) + partial response (PR))/total number of subjects ×100%. Measurable lesion according to the RECISTv1.1, 3 months|Event-Free Survival, Defined as the interval between the first conversion therapy and the first recorded related events, including preoperative disease progression, postoperative disease recurrence, and death from any cause., 2 years|Relapse-Free Survival, Defined as postoperative the first recorded postoperative recurrence of disease or death from any cause, 2 years
Peritoneal metastasis is the most common pattern of disease relapse and is attributed to the dismal prognosis of the gastric cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest that systemic chemotherapy is the first-line standard strategy, and chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab for patients with positive HER-2. HIPEC can significantly improve survival in peritoneal metastasis from gastric cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 antibody has shown promising outcomes for unresectable or metastatic solid tumors. The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIPEC combined with Sintilimab (Tyvyt®) in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis.
