Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab (Avastin) for the Treatment of Metastatic or Unresectable Angiosarcoma
This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 2 study with Paclitaxel in combination with Bevacizumab in patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Angiosarcoma. The study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of combining two drugs Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in the treatment of Angiosarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery, or has spread to other parts of your body. The primary objective is to evaluate 4month non progression rate. The secondary objective is to evaluate overall response rate after 3rd and 6th cycle, median duration of response, 6th and 12th month survival, toxicity of Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab combination, toxicity of maintenance Bevacizumab and to collect paraffin-embedded tumor blocks for angiogenesis markers and tissue microarray.

DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival (PFS), The primary objective of this study was to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS or non-progression rate) through 4 months from start of treatment.

Progression is defined as ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, as compared to the baseline measurements, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)., 4 months
Overall Response Rate After 3 Cycles, Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, per protocol. Overall response rate (ORR) is the sum of the Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) rates. The ORR for participants after 3 cycles of treatment (12 weeks) is expressed as the number and proportion of subjects.

RECIST Criteria

* CR = Disappearance of all target lesions
* PR = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s),
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria, 12 weeks|Overall Response Rate After 6th Cycle, Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, per protocol. Overall response rate (ORR) is the sum of the Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) rates. The ORR for participants after 6 cycles of treatment (24 weeks) is expressed as the number and proportion of subjects.

RECIST Criteria

* CR = Disappearance of all target lesions
* PR = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s),
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria, 6 Cycles|Overall Survival (OS) at 6 Months, Assessed as the number of subjects known to remain alive 6 months after study entry, 6 months|Overall Survival (OS) at 12 Months, Assessed as the number of subjects known to remain alive 12 months after study entry, 12 months
Regimen A versus B was chosen at the discretion of the treating physician. Both groups were analyzed together as far as outcome.

Patients were to receive paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours every 21 days (Regimen A) or pactlitaxel 90 mg/m2 weekly x 3 of a 28 day cycle (Regimen B) followed by bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously over (cycle 1: 90 min; cycle 2: 60 min; cycles 3-6: 30 min) every 21 days x 6 cycles. Maintenance bevacizumab (MB) started after the completion of combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab and it was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 21 days for a maximum of 8 cycles. Patients were allowed to receive growth factors. Dose reductions were done based on hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities.
