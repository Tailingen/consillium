Assessment of TK006 in Patients With Breast Cancer-related Bone Metastases
This is a single-center, open-label, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of single and multiple subcutaneous injection TK006 in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: TK006
Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) which are related to TK006 assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Collect the information of AEs and SAEs, vital sign, physical examination, laboratory examination and electrocardiogram during the trial., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time 'last' where last is the last time point after administration [AUClast], Calculated by the linear trapezoidal method., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC0-inf], Calculated by the linear trapezoidal and extrapolation method., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|Maximum observed maximum plasma concentration [Cmax], The maximum (or peak) serum concentration that TK006 achieves after the drug has been administrated and before the administration of a second dose., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|Time to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration [Tmax], The time at which the Cmax is observed., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|Terminal elimination half-life[T1/2], The time required to divide the plasma concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium, and not the time required to eliminate half the administered dose., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|bioavailability corrected apparent volume of the central compartment cleared of drug per unit [Cl/F], The apparent volume of the central compartment cleared of drug per unit time was estimated using the formula: Cl/F = Dose / AUC0-∞, single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|bioavailability corrected apparent volume of distribution [Vd/F], Apparent volume of distribution based on the terminal elimination phase., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|urine creatinine corrected cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen [uNTX/Cr], For singel dose cohort, detecting the level of uNTX at screening period, day 0 (before dosing)、day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28, day 56, day 84 and day 112 For multiple dose cohort：detecting the level of uNTX at screening period, day 0 (before dosing)、day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28 (before dosing), day 56 (before dosing), day 84 and day 140.

Assessing the change of uNTX level to baseline and the uNTX should be corrected by urine creatinine., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|serum bone alkaline phosphatase [bALP], Assessing the change of serum bALP level to baseline. For singel dose cohort, detecting the level of uNTX at screening period, day 0 (before dosing)、day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28, day 56, day 84 and day 112 For multiple dose cohort：detecting the level of uNTX at screening period, day 0 (before dosing)、day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28 (before dosing), day 56 (before dosing), day 84 and day 140., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days|anti-drug antibody [ADA], Quantitative assay the ADA. For single cohort, the ADA titer would be detected at day 0 (before dosing) and day 56.

For multiple dose cohort, the ADA titer would be detected at day 0 (before dosing), day 28 (before dosing), day 56 (before dosing), day 84 and day 140., single dose cohort：112 days, multiple dose cohort：140 days
This is an single-center, open-label, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of single and multiple subcutaneous injection TK006 in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. It contains 4 cohorts：60 mg single-dose conhort, 120 mg single-dose conhort, 180 mg single-dose conhort and 120 mg Q4W （one dose every 4 weeks, 3 dose totally） conhort.
