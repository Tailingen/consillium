PIVKA-II for Predicting Portal Vein Thrombosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The goal of this cross-sectional observational study is to evaluate the relation between Prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II) and the presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

Researchers will compare PIVKA-II serum levels in HCC patients with PVTT and without PVTT.

Participants will undergo history-taking, clinical examination, laboratory investigations, PIVKA-II serum level, Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, BCLC staging, abdominal ultrasonography, and Triphasic CT abdomen with contrast or MRI to evaluate tumor site, size, number, and presence of PVTT (a filling defect in the portal vein or its branch to distinguish PVTT or thrombus).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II)
PIVKA-II serum level for prediction of PVTT in HCC patients., PIVKA-II level (mAU/mL) will be measured in serum of HCC patients with and without PVTT., through study completion, an average of 1 year
