Study of ALE.C04 in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of ALE.C04 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, to characterize pharmacokinetics profile of ALE.C04, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for ALE.C04 in combination with pembrolizumab and to assess anti-tumor activity of ALE.C04 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Head and Neck Cancer.

Among those items, 28 items are symptoms scales with score range from 1 to 4. A high score represents a high level of symptomatology. The 2 other items are global health status with score range of 1 to 7. A high score represents high quality of life., Phase II combination part only - Up to 4.5 year|Change from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Question Head and Neck module 43 (HN43), The HN43 has 43 items of symptoms scale with score range of 1 to 4. A high score represents a high level of symptomatology., Phase II combination part only - Up to 4.5 year
The study comprises a phase I and a phase II. The phase I dose escalation part for both ALE.C04 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab and a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) part for ALE.C04 in combination with pembrolizumab. The phase II comprises a 1:1 randomized 2 arms assessing ALE.C04 and pembrolizumab given in combination versus pembrolizumab monotherapy
