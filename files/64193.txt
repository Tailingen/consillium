Integrative Nutrition Care Plan for the Patient With Liver and Colorectal Cancer
At present, the families of cancer patients are lack knowledge and experience of nutritional care after discharge. As a result, cancer patients often suffer from low nutritional status after being discharged from the hospital.

This study intends to design a home nutrition care plan to explore the effect of a home nutrition care plan on the nutritional status of patients with liver cancer and colorectal cancer at risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition or side effects often lead to natural food intake for patients. It is not enough to meet the nutritional requirements, so it is matched with dietary products to help patients more easily meet their nutritional requirements. Supplements are used to alleviate patients' side effects. It is hoped that they can help patients improve their nutritional status.
