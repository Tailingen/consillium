A First-in-human of Multiplle Doses of BB-1709 in Subjects With Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to test in patients with local advanced/metastatic solid tumors. the main questions it aims to answer are:

* to assess the safety and tolerability of BB-1709.
* to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and/or the PR2D of BB-1709
Solid Tumor
DRUG: BB-1709
Number of subjects with adverse events and serious adverse events, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BB-1709, up to 3 years
Area under the serum concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), To characterize the PK of BB-1709, Pre-dose and post-dose during Cycle 1 through Cycle 8. Duration of each cycle is 21 days
The study consists of two parts: dose-escalation (Phase Ia) and dose expansion (Phase Ib).

Phase Ia is a multicenter, open-label, first time in human clinical trial to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BB-1709, and to establish the MTD and/or RP2D of BB-1709 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Phase Ib is to explore one or more RP2Ds to further assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BB-1709 in patients with specific types of solid tumor.
