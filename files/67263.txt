A Clinical Investigation to Confirm the Ability of MammoWave in Breast Lesions Detection
This is a multicentric, single arm, prospective, stratified by breast density clinical investigation to confirm the ability of the microwave mammogram 'MammoWave' to detect breast lesions.

MammoWave is a innovative medical device, class IIa marked CE, which uses microwaves instead of ionazing radiation (x-ray) for breast lesions. Specifically MammoWave employs a novel technique wich generates images by processing very low power (\<1mW) microwave.

The MammoWave exam takes few minutes for breast and is performed with the patient lying in a confortable facing down position.

MammoWave is safe to be used at any age, in any condition (pregnancy, specific illness and for unlimited number of times.

NOTE: RadioSpin (Deep oscillatory neural networks computing and learning through the dynamics of RF neurons interconnected by RF spintronic synapses) is one of the projects funded by EU within the call FUTURE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (FET) H2020-FETPROACT. The RadioSpin project aims to build a hardware neural network, as a "Hardware Artificial Intelligence" will be implemented. During the project, these hardware neural networks will be optimized and tested on MammoWave data, being UBT partner of RadioSpin consortium (Grant agreement ID: 101017098), During the Baseline
The maximum number of participants to the clinical investigation will be 600 (for all the sites). The study will be composed of two phases: a preliminary phase to 'optimize the imaging algorithm for each apparatus installed at each centre', where 15 volunteers (in each centre) having breast with no lesions (NL) will be examined by MammoWave. In the second phase, the remaining people will be enrolled (BL will be 50% of total) and examined by MammoWave by the clinical investigator, and results will be compared with the effective diagnosis already obtained by standard clinical methods. BL includes malignant lesions (BC) and benign lesions, and may be palpable or non-palpable lesions. BL includes also isolated clustered microcalcifications.

The primary gol of the clinical study is to assess MammoWave's ability in BL detection.

The study will involve investigational sites in Italy, Germany and Spain.
