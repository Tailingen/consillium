1911GCCC: Galeterone or Galeterone With Gemcitabine for Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Assess the effectiveness of galeterone in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: galeterone|DRUG: Gemcitabine
response rate, number of patients whose disease shrink during treatment, 8 weeks post treatment
progression-free survival, time for galeterone to control the disease, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 100 months|overall survival, total life expectancy, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of galeterone, an investigational drug, in pancreatic cancer.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved galeterone for pancreatic cancer. Galeterone is an androgen receptor inhibitor that showed anti-cancer activity in pancreatic cancer in research lab. In this study, the investigator is interested in evaluating galeterone alone or in combination with chemotherapy in treating pancreatic cancer.
