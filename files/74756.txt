A Study to Evaluate the Immune Response and Safety of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 Vaccine/Cervarix TM Vaccine in Healthy Females Aged 15-25 Years
Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer. The infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared, can lead to cervical cancer in women. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (Cervarix TM) vaccine.

The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
