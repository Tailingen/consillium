Identification of Mechanism in the Erythroid Response in Patients With Myelodysplasia Undergoing Chelation Therapy
The study aims to evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the erythroid response observed in some patients with myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia treated with Deferasirox or Deferoxamina.
Myelodysplasia|Myelofibrosis|Aplastic Anemia
To assess the molecular mechanism underlying the erythroid response, The primary outcome is to evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the erythroid response (hemogoblin increase and reduction or elimination of trasfusion dependence) observed in some patients with myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia treated with Deferasirox or Deferoxamina, 12 months
