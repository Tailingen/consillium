A Study of Evorpacept (ALX148) With Azacitidine for Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (ASPEN-02)
This Phase 1/2 clinical study will evaluate evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: evorpacept|DRUG: azacitidine
Phase 1: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of participants with a DLT, Up to 28 days|Phase 1: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), To identify the RP2D of ALX148 in combination with AZA, Approximately 2 years|Phase 2: Complete response rate (CRR), Number of participants achieving a complete response per International Working Group (IWG) criteria, Approximately 6 months
The Phase 1 will consist of a dose escalation of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with azacitidine to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose of ALX148 in combination with azacitidine. The Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with azacitidine compared to azacitidine alone for patients with previously untreated higher risk MDS.
