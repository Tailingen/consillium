PK of Melphalan During Treatment With Melflufen and Dexamethasone in Patients With RRMM and Impaired Renal Function
This was a multicenter study of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of melphalan during treatment with melflufen and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and impaired renal function.
Renal Impairment|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Melflufen|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Cmax of Melphalan, Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Samples were drawn 5-10 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-3 hours after the end of infusion, and 5-7 hours after the end of infusion.|Tmax of Melphalan, Time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax), Samples were drawn 5-10 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-3 hours after the end of infusion, and 5-7 hours after the end of infusion.|Area Under the Curve (0-t) of Melphalan, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0h to the last measurable concentration., Samples were drawn 5-10 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-3 hours after the end of infusion, and 5-7 hours after the end of infusion.|Area Under the Curve (Inf) of Melphalan, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 hours to infinity, Samples were drawn 5-10 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-3 hours after the end of infusion, and 5-7 hours after the end of infusion.|T1/2 of Melphalan, Elimination half-life of melphalan, Samples were drawn 5-10 minutes after the end of infusion, 2-3 hours after the end of infusion, and 5-7 hours after the end of infusion.
Best Confirmed Response, Best confirmed response required 2 consecutive assessments with the same response result made at any time. In case at the second consecutive assessment (made at any time) the response is higher than the previous one, then confirmed response (linked to the first assessment visit) will be the first one (e.g., PR - VGPR consecutive pair will lead to a PR confirmed response at the first visit). In case the second consecutive response is lower than the first one, then confirmed response (linked to the first assessment visit) will be the second one (e.g. CR-VGPR consecutive pair will lead to a VGPR confirmed response at the first visit)., Patients were assessed for response after each cycle. After discontinuation of therapy, patients continued to be assessed until documented progression (confirmed on 2 consecutive assessments) or initiation of subsequent therapy (max duration 127.1 weeks).|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) is the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as best response, as assessed by the Investigator., Patients were assessed for response after each cycle. After discontinuation of therapy, patients continued to be assessed until disease progression (confirmed on 2 consecutive assessments) (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed minimal response (MR) or better (stringent complete response \[sCR\], complete response \[CR\], very good partial response \[VGPR\], partial response \[PR\], and MR) as their best response, as assessed by the Investigator., Patients were assessed for response after each cycle (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of first study drug (the earliest of melflufen and dexamethasone start date) initiation to the date of first documentation of confirmed PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants were deemed 'progressed' in case of i) unconfirmed progressive disease (PD) as the final response assessment, ii) death after at least one response assessment or PD based on at least two consecutive response assessments at any time, or iii) death before the first response assessment. The distribution of PFS was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. The median PFS was estimated from the 50th percentile of the corresponding K-M estimates. The 95% confidence interval for median PFS was constructed using the method of Brookmeyer (Brookmeyer, 1982)., Patients were assessed from the initiation of therapy until documented disease progression or initiation of new therapy (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first evidence of confirmed assessment of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) to first confirmed disease progression, or to death due to any cause. The distribution of DOR was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. The median DOR was estimated from the 50th percentile of the corresponding K-M estimates. The 95% confidence interval for median DOR was constructed using the method of Brookmeyer (Brookmeyer, 1982)., Patients were assessed for response from the first measure of a confirmed response (PR or better) until confirmed progression, death, or initiation of subsequent therapy (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Duration of Clinical Benefit, Duration of clinical benefit (DOCB) was calculated as time in months from the first evidence of confirmed assessment of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or minimal response (MR) to first confirmed disease progression, or to death due to any cause. DOCB was defined only for patients with a confirmed MR or better. DOCB was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. The median DOCB was estimated from the 50th percentile of the corresponding K-M estimates. The 95% confidence interval for median DOCB was constructed using the method of Brookmeyer (Brookmeyer, 1982)., Patients were assessed from the first measure of a confirmed MR or better until confirmed progression, death, or initiation of subsequent therapy (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Time to Response, Time from first dose of therapy to first documented confirmed response of partial response (PR) or better., From initiation of therapy until documented disease response (maximum duration 127.1 weeks).|Time to Clinical Benefit, Time to clinical benefit was defined as the time from first dose of therapy to first documented confirmed response of minimal response (MR) or better., Patients were assessed for response after each cycle. After discontinuation of therapy, patients continued to be assessed until documented progression (confirmed on 2 consecutive assessments) or initiation of subsequent therapy (max duration 127.1 weeks).|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time in months from initiation of therapy to death due to any cause. Patients still alive at the end of the study, or lost to follow up, were censored at last day known alive., Patients were followed for overall survival until death or until the last patient in the study had documented progression (confirmed on 2 consecutive assessments) or initiation of subsequent therapy (maximum of 39.2 months).
This was a multicenter study assessing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of melflufen given on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle, together with weekly dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma or RRMM and impaired renal function, as well as the relationship between renal function and PK parameters for the active metabolite melphalan.
