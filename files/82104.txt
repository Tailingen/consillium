HAIC Sequential TAE Combined With Tislelizumab and Surufatinib in Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a single center, single arm, phase II, prospective study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of HAIC combined with TAE plus an ICI and an TKI in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Compared with systemic intravenous chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC) has the advantages of increasing local drug concentration and reducing systemic toxic and side effects. All patients were treated with HAIC (Oxaliplatin and Raltitrexed ). Surufatinib was taken orally after meals, once a day, with 3-5 capsules (50mg/capsule) each time； Tislelizumab was given 200mg every 3 weeks. The treatment continued until the patient developed the disease or met the other criteria for terminating the study.
