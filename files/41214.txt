Structural Description of Skin Biopsies With Dynamic Full-field Optical Coherence Tomography on Suspected Basal Cell Carcinoma Lesions, a Pilot Study (DOCTOBA)
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are the most frequent skin cancers. Their incidence is constantly increasing. BCC diagnosis is first clinically suspected and then confirmed following histological examination of either a skin biopsy or the excisional specimen. Surgery is the first-line treatment and some procedures (notably Mohs surgery) require extemporaneous histological analysis of the edges to ensure a complete excision. Such on-site histopathological examination can be time consuming and associated with decreased sensitivity. Skin imaging techniques have already been tested to overcome these limitations and seem promising. Although some of them - such as confocal microscopy - are already even used in vivo, there is to date no report of the use of full-field optical coherence tomography for the diagnosis of BCC.

The DOCTOBA study intends to describe direct histopathological examination of fresh skin biopsy or excisional specimen with dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography.

OTHER: Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography analysis of skin biopsy or resection
Histopathological analysis of basal cell carcinoma with dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography, Provide a better understanding of the ability of dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography to identify and characterize the usual basal cell carcinoma, comprising basaloid cells with a thin pale cytoplasm surrounding round or oval nuclei with a rough granulated chromatin pattern, palisade arrangement, artificially created slits, rather chaotic internal arrangement, mitoses and necrosis ; but also to identify the different sub-types of basal cell carcinoma (nodular, superficial, infiltrating, scleroderma)., Outcome measure is assessed 15 days following skin biopsy or resection
Histopathological analysis of healthy skin with dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography, Provide a better understanding of the ability of dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography to identify the normal structures of the skin (meaning not affected by carcinoma), i.e. the different layers of the skin (epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue) and the skin appendages (hair follicles and glands), also to recognize the different cells and components (keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel celles and collagen) and underlayers (stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum basale, epidermal cretes, dermo-hypodermic junction, papillary dermis and reticularis dermis)., Outcome measure is assessed 15 days following skin biopsy or resection
