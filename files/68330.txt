Stopping TSC Onset and Progression 2: Epilepsy Prevention in TSC Infants
This phase I/II clinical trial is an open-label clinical trial design to verify safety and dosing for TAVT-18 (sirolimus) powder for oral solution in TSC infants (N=5).
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex|Epilepsy
DRUG: TAVT-18 (sirolimus)
Safety - Adverse Events, Percentage of subjects reporting severe (CTCAE v5.0 grade \>= 3) adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), 12 months of age|Efficacy - Time to Seizure Onset, Time from treatment initiation to seizure onset, 12 months of age
Treatment Discontinuance Due to Adverse Events, Percentage of subjects that reduce or discontinue treatment due to an AE or SAE (any grade), 12 months of age|Treatment Disruption Due to Adverse Events, Number of days treatment is withheld due to an AE or SAE (any grade)., 12 months of age|Precision Dosing Accuracy, Blood trough concentration of sirolimus (ng/ml), 12 months of age|Age at Seizure Onset, Patient age in months at time of seizure onset, 12 and 24 months of age|Seizure Type, Percentage of subjects reporting infantile spasms, focal seizures, or other seizure types, 12 and 24 months of age|Seizure Frequency, Number of seizures in past 30 days, 12 and 24 months of age|TAND Severity Assessed by the TAND-L Checklist, Overall severity rating on the TSC-associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders-Lifetime Version (TAND-L) Checklist. The TAND-L Checklist severity rating ranges from 0-10, with higher values indicating greater concern.

Parent Rating: "Considering all of the issues reported today how much have these bothered, troubled, or distressed you/your child/family?"; Min = 0 Max = 10; higher values indicate greater concern.

Clinician Rating: "Interviewer's judgement of impact/burden on the individual/child/family."; Min = 0 Max = 10; higher values indicate greater concern, 12 and 24 months of age|Adaptive Behavior Assessed by the the VABS, Composite score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The VABS composite score is normed to 100 = average or 50% percentile in normal populations, with lower values indicative of greater concern.

Adaptive Scale: Minimum = 20, Maximum = 140, Standard deviation is +/- 15, 12 and 24 months of age|Global Neurodevelopment Assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Composite score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development is normed to 100 = average or 50% percentile in normal populations, with lower values indicative of greater concern.

Cognitive Domain: Minimum = 40, Maximum = 160, Standard Deviation is +/- 15 Language Domain: Minimum = 40, Maximum = 160, Standard Deviation is +/- 15 Motor Doman: Minimum = 40, Maximum = 160, Standard Deviation is +/- 15, 12 and 24 months of age
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by genetic mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Age at time of seizure onset in TSC infants has been linked to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in this high-risk population. TAVT-18 is a novel formulation of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. This study evaluates TAVT-18 as a targeted, disease-modifying drug therapy for preventing or delaying seizure onset in TSC using a rational, mechanism-based therapeutic approach.
