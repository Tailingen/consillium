Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Early GI Neoplasia in the United Kingdom
Multicentre cohort study on the use of endoscopic submucosal dissection for the treatment of early gastrointestinal neoplasia.
Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
Curative resection rate, % of successful resections free of disease at follow up endoscopy by the end of the follow up period (2 years), 2 years
En bloc resection rate, % of en bloc resections obtained at the time of initial endoscopic submucosal dissection, At the time of procedure|Complication rates, % of complications noted within 28 days following endoscopic submucosal dissection, 28 days post procedure|Mortality rates, % of patients alive at the end of the 2 year follow up, 2 years
Data will be collected from participating centres on en bloc resection, curative resection, R0 resection and complications/adverse events over a 2 year follow up period.
