Thoracic Radiotherapy Plus Durvalumab in Elderly and/or Frail NSCLC Stage III Patients Unfit for Chemotherapy
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial investigating the combination of thoracic radiotherapy plus Durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC (stage III) that are unfit for chemotherapy (e.g. due to age and/or frailty).
NSCLC, Stage III
DRUG: Durvalumab Injection [Imfinzi]|RADIATION: Thoracic Radiotherapy (TRT) conventionally|RADIATION: Thoracic Radiotherapy (TRT) hypofractionated
Toxicity (pneumonitis), Toxicity, defined by the occurence of treatment-related pneumonitis grade ≥ 3, up to 35 months|Objective response, Objective response evaluated at 12 weeks (3 months) after first durvalumab administration according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 35 months
treatment-related AEs and SAEs, Occurence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs according to CTCAE V5.0, up to 35 months|frequency of abnormal laboratory parameters (hematology panel, chemistry panel, Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)), Frequency of abnormal values of laboratory parameters, up to 35 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS according to RECIST 1.1, up to 35 months|Duration of Clinical Benefit, Duration of Clinical Benefit (Duration of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD)) according to RECIST 1.1, up to 35 months|Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS), Time from the date of allocation / randomization to the date of first observed metastatic lesion (investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, up to 35 months|Overall survival, time from the date of treatment allocation to the date of death, up to 35 months|Quality of Life (FACT-L), measured by FACT-L questionnaire, up to 35 months|objective response rate, Descriptive sub-group analyses of efficacy in relation to PD-L1 expression levels (\<°1% vs ≥°1%), up to 35 months
Vulnerability assessment based on the G8-screening questionnaire, Vulnerability assessment based on the G8-screening questionnaire and its association to survival and outcome, up to 35 months
This trial investigates the feasibility and treatment efficacy when combining durvalumab treatment with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy (HYPO-group) in previously untreated NSCLC stage III patients prone to radiotherapy only.

A safety lead-in phase with stop-and-go design will precede full enrollment into the HYPO-group.

Tumor tissue as well as blood and stool samples will be collected for future biomarker analysis.

It is hypothesized that TRT combined with concurrent durvalumab administration in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are not amenable to sequential radio-/chemotherapy

1. is safe and feasible,
2. will improve treatment efficacy by a synergistic effect of checkpoint inhibition and the photon-induction of immunostimulatory pathways.
3. will have an effect on the immunological characteristics of the tumor, the microenvironment, and the systemic immune response, such as upregulation of PD-L1 or secretion of stimulatory cytokines and recruitment and priming of immunocompetent cells, which might then mediate the "abscopal effect" beyond the irradiated targets.
