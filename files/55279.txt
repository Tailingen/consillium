Early Stage Lung Cancer Screening With Low-dose Computed Tomographic
The present study is a randomized controlled trial of LDCT screening for lung cancer versus usual care. 6000 high-risk subjects (age 45-70) were recruited and randomized to the Active arm (Baseline + 2 biennial repeated LDCT screening) or to the Passive arm, followed up in usual care (Baseline + 2 biennial repeated questionnaire inquiries). Follow-up for lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and overall mortality was performed. Blood samples were stored from the Active arm in a Biobank. Management of positive screening test was carried out by a pre-specified protocol.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Low Dose Computed Tomography
Lung cancer incidence rate, Assess the number of lung cancer incidences after each round of screening in both arms. Compared the stage differences between screening arm and usual care arm., 5 years
Lung cancer mortality, Assess lung cancer mortality in both arms within next 5 years after first round of screening., 5 years|All-cause mortality, Assess all-cause mortality in both arms within next 5 years after first round of screening., 5 years
Nodule detection rate, Assess nodule detection rate, and the types and sizes of nodules detected in LDCT screening arm., One year
