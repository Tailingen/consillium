A Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of DR30303 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label Phase 1, First in Human trial of DR30303, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2). It is composed of humanized variable domain of heavy chain of antibody (VHH) fused with engineered immunoglobulin gamma-1(IgG1) Fc. It is being testing against advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.

Objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), These measure are defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Disease control rate (DCR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), These measure are defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR and stable disease (SD), from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Duration of response (DOR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), These measure are defined as the duration from the first occurrence of confirmed CR or PR until the date of disease progression or death (from any cause), from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Clinical Benefit Rate, Defined as Proportion of subjects with CR, PR and duration of SD ≥ 12 weeks, from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Duration of disease control (DDC) per RECIST v1.1, For subjects with CR, PR, or SD, duration was calculated from the first assessment as CR, PR, or SD until the date of disease progression or death (from any cause), from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1, These measure are defined as time from start of treatment to tumor progression or death from any cause, from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression，or the date of death from any cause, or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|6-month and 12-month survival rates, from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression , 6 months，12 months whichever came first|Overall survival (OS) per RECIST v1.1, These measure are defined as time from start of treatment to death from any cause, from date of first dose start until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause，or the date of will receive DR30303 for 1 year whichever came first|Pharmacokinetic (PK) of DR30303: Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), up to 28 days following last dose|PK of DR30303: Area Under the concentration-time Curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last), up to 28 days following last dose|PK of DR30303: Area Under the concentration-time Curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf), up to 28 days following last dose|PK of DR30303: Time of the maximum concentration (tmax), up to 28 days following last dose|PK of DR30303: Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), up to 28 days following last dose|Immunogenicity by measurement of Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), up to 28 days following last dose
This study is an open, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of DR30303 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study is composed of two parts: part 1 is Dose escalation stage and part 2 is Dose expansion stage.
