Combination of Decitabine and Temozolomide in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
The combination of TMZ and DAC may effect dual modulation of DNA repair genes resulting in improved clinical response.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Temozolomide|PROCEDURE: biopsy
Percentage of Participants That Experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia which lasts \>7 days; grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxic effects., Up to 26 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Using RECIST v1.0 criteria, overall response rate (ORR) was determined by the number of participants with complete response (CR) + the number of participants with partial response (PR) / the number of participants with complete response (CR) + the number of participants with partial response (PR) + the number of participants with stable disease (SD) + the number of participants with progressive disease (PD), multiplied by 100. Per RECIST v1.0 criteria (assessed by MRI or CT): Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response (PR) nor sufficient increase to to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD); PD, 20% increase in the sum if target lesion or the appearance of new lesions; Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions., Up to 30 months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of DAC + TMZ, Toxicity assessments used CTCAE v3.0. Two dose levels were explored in the phase I portion of the study. A modified 3 + 3 'up and down' design was used. Given the knowledge that DAC exhibits its epigenetic effects at 30-fold lower doses than at its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), escalation of DAC to the MTD was not done., Up to 26 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Using RECIST v1.0 criteria, disease control rate (DCR) was determined by the number of participants with complete response (CR) + the number of participants with partial response (PR) + the number of participants with stable disease (SD) / the number of participants with complete response (CR) + the number of participants with partial response (PR) + the number of participants with stable disease (SD) + the number of participants with progressive disease (PD). Per RECIST v1.0 criteria (assessed by MRI or CT): Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response (PR) nor sufficient increase to to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD); PD, 20% increase in the sum if target lesion or the appearance of new lesions; Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions., Up to 30 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from study entry until the documented radiological or symptomatic progression. Per RECIST v1.0 criteria (assessed by MRI or CT): Progressive Disease (PD); PD, 20% increase in the sum if target lesion or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 42 months|6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate, 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from study entry until the death or date of last contract., Up to 42 months|1-year Overall Survival (OS) Rate, Percentage of patients alive at one year (number of patients alive / total number of evaluable (analyzed) patients)., 12 months
Primary Objectives:

* Phase I: To determine the safety, tolerability, and Phase II recommended dose of the combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC.
* Phase II: To determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate, of the combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC given at the Phase II recommended dose to patients with metastatic melanoma.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine pharmacokinetics of the combination of TMZ and DAC in patients with metastatic melanoma.
* To determine, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor tissue, the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination of TMZ and DAC on promoter methylation and expression of selected genes and correlate these with response.
* To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with the combination of TMZ and DAC.
