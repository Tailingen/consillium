FOLFOX vs Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Non-fit to FOLFIRINOX
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) incidence increases regularly in Western countries and it is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 2020. The prognosis of this disease remains very poor with an overall 5-year survival rate less than 5%.

The FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil \[5-FU\], folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine demonstrated to be more effective than gemcitabine alone, and are both validated as standard first-line treatment options for metastatic PAC. However, the use of FOLFIRINOX is limited to patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 and aged less than 75 years. Nab-paclitaxel is currently not reimbursed in France.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: FOLFOX
Overall survival (OS) at 24 months, OS will be defined as the delay between the date of inclusion and the date of death (whatever the cause) or the date of last news if the patient is alive., At 24 months after inclusion
Objective response rate, RECIST criteria 1.1 in case of evaluable lesion, At 24 months after inclusion|Disease control rate, RECIST criteria 1.1 in case of evaluable lesion, At 24 months after inclusion|Duration of response, The time interval between the first occurrence of partial or complete response according to RECIST criteria and secondary progression (clinic or radiologic), Tumor assessment will be done every 2 cycles (1cycle = 28 days), assessed up to 24 months after inclusion|Duration of disease control, The time interval between the first occurrence of disease control (stabilization or partial response or complete response) according to RECIST criteria and secondary progression (clinic or radiologic), Tumor assessment will be done every 2 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days), assessed up to 24 months after inclusion|Progression Free Survival (PFS), In most cases, patient will have a radiologic evaluation and radiologic progression will be defined according to RECIST criteria. In absence of radiologic evaluation (decision of investigator), clinic progression would be defined by investigators according to clinical deterioration of PS, increase of symptoms, and/or increase of tumor markers., From inclusion to the date of first event (progression or death) or date of last news if the patient is alive without progression, assessed up to 60 months|Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA-19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, At baseline (at selection or inclusion visit before starting treatment) and then each 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) until end of treatment, up to 24 months|Toxicities: Type, frequency and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, Toxicities will be described and grades according to International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, From inclusion to end of treatment, up to 24 months|Safety: Rate of serious adverse events, grade 3-4 toxicities (hematologic and non-hematologic), Rate of serious adverse events, grade 3-4 toxicities (hematologic and non-hematologic). Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0., From inclusion to end of treatment, up to 24 months|inLongitudinal changes in Quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire and a consensual geriatric minimum data set (SOFOG) for patients ≥75 years), Quality of life will be studied by means of the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire (30 questions, score from 30 to 126) and a consensual geriatric minimum data set (SOFOG: 7 questions, score from 0 to 24) for patients ≥75 years at inclusion and at each cycle. A 5-point deterioration in HRQoL scores will be considered as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Time until MCID will be analyzed (for each questionnaire) and compared between the two groups. The dynamic change under treatment will be compared at each cycle., At inclusion, before starting treatment, and then Day 1 of each cycle (every 4 weeks, 1 cycle = 28 days) until end of treatment, up to 24 months|Dose intensity of each protocol, The dose intensity (DI) of each protocol will be calculated based on the number of cycles received by each patient. The relative DI will be calculated as the ratio of the DI to the DI indicated in the protocol (obtained as the dose specified per cycle in mg/m²), During the entire treatment period, up to 24 months|Quality-adjust Time Without Symptoms of disease or Toxicities (Q-TWiST), The Q-TWiST method combines treatment benefits and risks into a single measure by partitioning survival time into three health states and subsequently assigning quality-of life weights to the survival time in each state. The primary Q-TWiST analysis will be performed using the Intention-to-treat analysis(ITT) population, and will be supplemented with analyses in the per-protocol population (i.e., patients who received ≥80% of the protocol-defined treatment during the first 6 weeks of treatment) and analysed in pre-specified subgroups: age (\<75 years, ≥75 years), baseline PS (0-1, 2), liver metastases (Yes, No), and tumour location (head, other)., During the entire treatment period, up to 24 months|Rate of second and third line, For the patients who will stop the treatment of the protocol (for progression, toxicity or other reason...), we will register the date of beginning and of last administration of each new line of chemotherapy administered during the follow-up., From end of study treatment to patient death, assessed up to 60 months.
This trial is an open label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial comparing gemcitabine vs FOLFOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-fit for FOLFIRINOX. Adults fulfilling inclusion criteria and non-inclusion criteria will be randomized between a FOLFOX arm and a gemcitabine arm. The primary endpoint is the overall survival (OS) at 24 months. The secondary objectives are : objective response rate and disease control rate (RECIST v1.1, in case of evaluable lesion), duration of response, duration of disease control, progression free survival (PFS), the evolution of biomarkers Ca 19-9 and CEA under treatment, the toxicities according to International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, the safety of both arms, the quality of life, the dose intensity (DI) of each protocol, the Quality-Adjusted Survival, and the rate and type of second-line / third-line regimens chemotherapy. With an expected median survival time in the control group of 5 months, an accrual period of 3 years and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, a total of 199 patients per group are required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 based on a 5% two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, leading to a total number of 400 patients to include.
