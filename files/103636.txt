DRUG: CDK4/6 inhibitor
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of starting CDK4/6 inhibitor to the date of objective tumor progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first., From the date of starting CDK4/6 inhibitor to the date of first documentation of progression or death (up to approximately 2.5 years)
Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from starting CDK4/6 inhibitor to death from any cause., From the date of starting CDK4/6 inhibitor until death from any cause up to 3 years|Adverse events, Adverse events during CDK4/6 regimen will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., From the date of starting CDK4/6 inhibitor to the end of the treatment (up to approximately 2.5 years)
