A Randomized Controlled Study of Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Uracil- Tegafur (UFT) Compared With Surgery Alone (NSAS-GC)
This is a controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of UFT on survival compared with surgery alone. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either surgery alone or surgery followed by UFT within 6 weeks after curative resection. To assess treatment response, data on recurrence and survival will be collected for 5 years after enrollment of the last patient. To evaluate safety, data on adverse events will be collected for 16 months after the start of treatment.
