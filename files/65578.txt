BIBF 1120 in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
VEGF inhibition by BEV may induce a change in tumor invasiveness and treatment failure is often associated with remote metastases. BEV may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Cediranib, a pan-VEGF inhibitor has shown promising results in recurrent GBM.

VEGF-blocking with small molecules may overcome the mechanism of resistance, and response to BIBF-1120 in such circumstances may open a new treatment option in GBM. In additional, recurrent glioblastomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed.
