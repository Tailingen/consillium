Impact of Photobiomodulation (PBM) on Biomarkers of Radiation Lymphedema and Fibrosis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
Radiation fibrosis syndrome (RFS) is a general side effect of radiation therapy (RT) which can adversely impact patients chronically over years typically triggered by an acute inflammatory state that evolves into chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling causing lymphedema, fibrosis, pain, atrophy and organ dysfunction. Some of the side effects that encompass RFS in the head and neck (HNC) population include decreased ability to fully open the mouth (trismus), neck pain and tightness (cervical dystonia), lymphedema (swelling), difficult with speech and swallowing and salivary hypofunction. Although there is Level I evidence demonstrating the benefit of Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy to prevent acute mucositis in HNC patients treated with RT, there is only limited data regarding its impact.

This is a clinical trial to compare active treatment (PBM-therapy) with sham control (Sham- therapy). Up to 60 patients will be randomized to the two groups with equal allocation to estimate the efficacy (soft tissue thickness) of external Photobiomodulation (PBM) with light-emitting diode (LED) planned therapy for the treatment of radiation fibrosis syndrome (RFS) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who have undergone radiation therapy (RT) compared with sham control.
