Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Exercise
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder characterized by oligo-ovulatory menstrual dysfunction, androgen excess and polycystic ovaries. It affects ten to fifteen percent of reproductive-age women and has been associated with complications in reproductive, metabolic and cardiovascular health. Current Clinical Practice Guidelines suggest exercise and weight loss for PCOS, although their specific roles in improving PCOS-related symptoms are uncertain.

Non-pharmacological treatments are appealing to many reproductive age women. There is preliminary evidence that exercise in PCOS may increase menstrual regularity, ovulation, cardiorespiratory fitness, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-esteem, and decrease body fat and insulin resistance. These studies have been limited by short durations and lack of randomization or appropriate control groups.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves brief intervals of near-maximal exercise alternating with lower-intensity exercise, is becoming increasingly popular in the exercise community. In some non-PCOS trials, HIIT resulted in improved cardiovascular fitness and greater fat loss compared with continuous aerobic exercise. No other trials are currently on-going that are comparing HIIT with continuous aerobic exercise training in women with PCOS (as confirmed by searches of the literature and the clinical trials registry maintained by the US NIH).
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
BEHAVIORAL: High Intensity Interval Training|BEHAVIORAL: Continuous Aerobic Exercise Training
Ovulation Rate, The ovulation rate is defined as the number of times a participant ovulates during the intervention period adjusted for the baseline ovulation rate during the run-in phase., Up to 9 months.

Scores range from 0-36, with higher scores indicating more hair growth., Up to 9 months.|Menstrual Cycle Length, The menstrual cycle starts on the first day of menses and lasts until menses resumes. A regular menstrual cycle length ranges from 24 to 35 days., Up to 9 months.|Luteal Phase Length, The luteal phase length is defined as the number of days from ovulation to menses (normal is 12 to 16 days)., Up to 9 months.|Pregnancy, Pregnancy will be confirmed by the presence of a fetal heart beat on a first-trimester ultrasound, ordered by the participant's physician., Up to 15 months.|Spontaneous Abortions, Non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation., Up to 15 months.|Live Births, The delivery of a live infant, Up to 15 months.|Body Weight, Change in body weight pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Body Mass Index, Change in body mass index pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Waist Circumference, Change in waist circumference pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Blood Pressure, Change in blood pressure pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Hemoglobin A1c, Change in hemoglobin A1c pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Fasting Glucose, Change in fasting glucose pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Fasting Insulin, Change in fasting insulin pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Homeostatic Model of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Change in HOMA-IR pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|HOMA-2, To assess insulin resistance using the updated HOMA-2 model, Up to 9 months.|Lipids - total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, Change in lipid profile pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Liver Enzymes - ALT, GGT, Change in liver enzymes pre- and post-intervention, Up to 9 months.|Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Change in cardiorespiratory fitness assessed as maximal oxygen consumption evaluated using a treadmill test and a metabolic cart, Up to 9 months.|Health-Related Quality of Life, Change in Health-Related Quality of Life using the PCOS-Q and SF-36, Up to 15 months.|Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Change in symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea pre- and post-intervention using the STOP-BANG score. This score has 8 questions, and the likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea increases with a score of 3 or more., Up to 9 months.|Participant Satisfaction, To assess participant satisfaction with their participation in this study using a questionnaire specifically designed for this study, with higher numbers indicating higher satisfaction., Up to 9 months.|Participant Recruitment - Number of Participants Screened, Participant recruitment will be assessed by recording the number of participants that were initially screened., Up to enrolment in study.|Participant Recruitment - Recruitment Method, The investigators will document how each participant was recruited (i.e. poster, physician referral, etc.)., Up to enrolment in study.|Participant Recruitment - Number of Participants That Met Criteria, The investigators will record the number that met all inclusion and exclusion criteria., Up to enrolment in the study.|Participant Recruitment - Number of Participants That Signed Informed Consent, The investigators will record the number that agreed to participate in the study and signed informed consent., Up to enrolment in the study.|Participant Dropout, Dropout will be reported as a percentage of participants that enrolled in the study and did not complete the study., Up to 15 months.|Adherence to Menstrual Cycle Tracking, Participants will record features of their menstrual cycle daily (menses, spotting, no menstrual bleeding) using a monthly calendar, or phone app. Adherence will be recorded as the percentage of data recorded over the study duration., Up to 9 months.|Adherence to Ovulation Prediction Kit (OPK) Testing, Participants will complete the OPK test daily, take a digital photograph of the used test strip and send it to the research team daily. Adherence will be recorded as the percentage completed over the study., Up to 9 months.|Adherence to Exercise Sessions, For individuals randomized to the high-intensity training group or the continuous aerobic exercise training group, exercise sessions will be tracked using a Polar heart rate monitor and data will be downloaded weekly at a supervised exercise session. Participants will also log their workouts (type, duration, intensity) in a log book., Up to 9 months.|Change in Gut Microbiota Composition, Pre- and post-intervention stool samples will be assessed with 16S rRNA sequencing., Up to 9 months.|Daily Physical Activity Level, All individuals will wear Polar A370 fitness trackers during the intervention phase, and daily steps and kilocalories per day will be recorded., Up to 9 months.|Physical Activity Enjoyment, Individuals randomized to the exercise groups will complete the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale during an exercise training session at the beginning of the exercise intervention, at 3 months into the intervention and at 6 months into the intervention., Up to 9 months.
