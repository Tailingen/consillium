Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients With dMMR and/or MSI Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Resistant to Anti-PD1 Monotherapy
NIPIRESCUE is a national, single-arm, open-label phase II study. The study aims to evaluate the clinical activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with MSI/dMMR mCRC resistant to anti-PD1 monotherapy and previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatine, irinotecan, and anti- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, ORR defined as the number of patients with partial or complete response from the beginning of the treatment divided by the total of number of patients evaluable for the primary endpoint analysis., At week 24 (6 months)
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, All grade and severe toxicities, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Assessed up 60 months|Disease control rate (DCR) by RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response, partial response, or stable disease after study treatment., At 12 week and 24 week|Duration of response, Duration of response is measured from the time of the first response observed (partial or complete) until documented tumor progression or death, At 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as time from beginning of treatment to progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., At 5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between beginning of treatment and death from any cause., At 5 years|Antigen-specific CD4+ T cell immunity, Assessment of antigen-specific CD4+ T cell immunity response as a biomarker of immunotherapy in dMMR/or MSI mCRC, At Baseline, at week 3 and week 6|Circulating tumoral DNA (ctDNA) changes during treatment, Evaluation of circulating tumoral DNA (ctDNA) changes during treatment as marker of treatment response, At Baseline, at week 3 and week 6|Gut microbiota composition, Analysis of gut microbiota composition changes and their association with clinical activity of study treatment, At baseline and at 6 weeks|MSI/MMR status, Tumor will be tested for MSI/MMR status using immunohistochemistry (anti-MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6) and PCR (pentaplex panel)., At baseline
