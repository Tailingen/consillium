Perioperative Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Cystectomy or Perioperative Pembrolizumab Plus Enfortumab Vedotin Plus Cystectomy Versus Cystectomy Alone in Participants Who Are Cisplatin-ineligible or Decline Cisplatin With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (MK-3475-905/KEYNOTE-905/EV-303)
This is a study of perioperative pembrolizumab or enfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in participants who are cisplatin-ineligible or decline cisplatin with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

The primary hypothesis is that perioperative pembrolizumab plus radical cystectomy (RC) plus pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and perioperative enfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab plus RC+PLND will achieve superior event-free survival (EFS) compared with RC+PLND alone.

With Amendment 5, outcome measures for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) were removed.

With Amendment 8, the primary outcome measure of pathologic complete response (pCR) rates was changed to a secondary outcome measure.

DRUG: Pembrolizumab|PROCEDURE: Surgery (radical cystectomy (RC) plus Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection [PLND])|DRUG: Enfortumab Vedotin
Event-Free Survival (EFS) between Arm C and Arm B, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes RC surgery or failure to undergo RC surgery in participants with residual disease (biopsy-proven muscle-invasive bladder cancer \[MIBC\] will be considered an event regardless of radiographic findings), gross residual disease left behind at the time of surgery, local or distant recurrence as assessed by imaging and/or biopsy, or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 6.75 years
