Evaluating Novel Therapies in ctDNA Positive GI Cancers
This study is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-site, pilot feasibility therapeutic trial. The study will enroll 20 patients across 4 cohorts (CRC, gastric, PDAC, and HCC/intra-hepatic-/extra-hepatic-, gall bladder adenocarcinomas) diagnosed with histologically confirmed GI cancers. These patients will have already completed all Standard of Care (SOC) treatments (including neoadjuvant, surgery, local therapies, and/or adjuvant therapy as applicable), as defined by the treating primary physician or research team, with curative intent but have a positive SignateraTM tumor-informed ctDNA test and NED radiographically by standard imaging within 28 days prior to enrollment and within 1 year of completing all curative-intent therapy. All patients will be treated with intravenous (IV) atezolizumab 1200 mg IV and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease recurrence, ctDNA POD, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal of consent with a maximum 12 month total duration of study therapy. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab drug will be provided.

Rates of SignateraTM ctDNA positive Patient identification, The number of local and regional SignateraTM ctDNA positive patients identified over 12 months in the setting of NED after all SOC definitive therapies (identified patients). This data will be obtained on a local and regional level through the SignateraTM company, Natera., 12 months|Rate of Enrollment, Percentage and absolute number of contacted patients who ultimately enrolled on trial (enrolled patients), 12 months|Rate of ctDNA Complete Response (CR), Percentage of patients in each cohort (and collectively) who achieve ctDNA CR (defined as ctDNA clearance on two sequential tests compared to baseline ctDNA and ongoing NED clinically/radiographically) within 12 weeks ± 14 days of study therapy., 12 weeks from start of treatment|Rate of ctDNA Partial Response (PR), Percentage of patients in each cohort (and collectively) who achieve ctDNA PR (ctDNA does not clear on two sequential tests, ctDNA does not double on each of two consecutive tests, does not increase on each of three consecutive tests, and ongoing NED clinically/radiographically) within 12 weeks ± 14 days of study therapy., 12 weeks from start of treatment|Rate of ctDNA Progression of Disease (POD) or Clinical/radiographic Relapse, Rate of ctDNA POD or clinical/radiographic relapse is defined as the percentage of patients in each cohort (and collectively) who experience ctDNA doubling (at least) on each of two consecutive, sequential tests using the prior ctDNA value as the reference point for doubling for each test, ctDNA rise on each of three consecutive ctDNA tests using the prior ctDNA value as the reference point for each test (ctDNA POD), or clinical/radiographic relapse within 12 weeks ± 14 days of study therapy., 12 weeks from start of treatment
Toxicity by CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Toxicity and safety analysis will occur in patients who received at least one full or partial dose of study treatment. Adverse events will be graded per NCI CTCAE v.5.0., 12 months|Reasons for failure of enrollment, Reasons for failure of enrollment characterized as patient preference, physician preference, or ineligibility, among others of identified and contacted patients will be reported, 12 months
