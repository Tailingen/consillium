Valproic Acid/Simvastatin Plus Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel Based Regimens in Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Patients
This is a proof-of-concept, Open label, randomized, multicentric, superiority phase-2 study.
Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
DRUG: Valproic acid|DRUG: Simvastatin 20mg|DRUG: Gemcitabine 1000 mg|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored at the time of the last available tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients alive at the time of analysis., 40 months
Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR), Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR) as defined by RECIST 1.1, calculated as the proportion of patients achieving complete or partial response relative to total enrolled patients., 40 months|Duration of Objective response (DOR), Duration of Objective response (DOR) defined as the first occurrence of a documented objective response until progression or death for any cause., 40 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients with complete/partial response and stable disease as their best response., 40 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. OS will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive for patients alive at the time of analysis., 40 months|Overall toxicity rate, Overall toxicity rate defined as the proportion of patients experiencing any grade AE accordingly to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (NCI CTC-AE) Version 5, relative to the total of patients receiving at least one cycle of treatment.AE will be listed individually by the patient and summarized overall (severity grades 1-4) and for grade â‰¥3 by treatment received., 40 months|Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of Life (QoL), based on questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline (prior to treatment start, once eligibility is confirmed) and every 8 weeks until 40 weeks after randomization, regardless of disease progression, or death, 40 months
The study hypothesizes that valproic acid (VPA) in combination with simvastatin (SIM) may improve the efficacy of first-line gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel-based regimens and extend progression free survival (PFS) as compared with chemotherapy alone, in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).

Correlative studies on tumor and blood samples could identify potential biomarkers of toxicity and efficacy helping to define personalized treatment strategy and adding new insight into the antitumor mechanism of the combination approach.
