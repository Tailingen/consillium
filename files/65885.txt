This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of mecbotamab vedotin (BA3011), a conditionally active biologic (CAB) AXL-targeted antibody drug conjugate (CAB-AXL-ADC) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Phase 1 of this study will consist of a dose escalation phase (enrollment complete as of Oct 2019) and a dose expansion phase (enrollment complete as of Jan 2024).

Phase 2 will consist of two parts. Part 1 is designed to evaluate mecbotamab vedotin alone and with nivolumab in patients with various types of advanced sarcomas (enrollment complete as of Jan 2024). Part 2 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of mecbotamab vedotin in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) and myxofibrosarcoma (MFS).
