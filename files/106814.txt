Prognostic Significance of the Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) in Postoperative Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: a Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study
This retrospective study included 704 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy. Patients were stratified into the LIPI good group and the intermediate/poor (int./poor) group based on dNLR (≥ 3) and LDH (≥ 245 U/L) levels. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for baseline differences and minimize selection bias. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were employed to evaluate the impact of LIPI and other clinical factors on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).
