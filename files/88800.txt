CXCR4 Targeted PET Imaging in APA Preoperative Localization Diagnosis
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of CXCR4 targeted PET imaging in preoperative localization diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA). Participants diagnosed with PA will be asked to be scanned by 68Ga-PentixaFor PET, and then underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS). Then, the responsible adrenal adenoma will be resected by adrenalectomy, and examined with pathological section and staining. Researchers will compare the sensitivity and specificity between 68Ga-PentixaFor PET imaging and AVS in preoperative localization diagnosis of PA.
