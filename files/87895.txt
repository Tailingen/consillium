Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation From HLA-matched Donor After Flu-Mel-PTCy Versus Flu-Mel-ATG Reduced-intensity Conditioning
The present project aims at comparing two conditioning regimens (FM-PTCy vs FM-ATG). The hypothesis is that one or the two regimens will lead to a 2-year cGRFS rate improvement from 30% (the cGRFS rate with FM without ATG/PTCy) to 45% (Pick-a-winner phase 2 randomized study).

This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II study pick-a-winner study, comparing 2 conditioning regimens. A total of 114 eligible patients with HLA-matched donors will be randomized 1:1 between the FM-PTCy arm and the FM-ATG arm, with stratification for donor type (related or unrelated). The recruitment period is 3 years with a 5-year follow-up plus a 10-year additional long-term follow-up (for GVHD status, disease status, second malignancy and QOL). The whole study will be completed within 18 years.
