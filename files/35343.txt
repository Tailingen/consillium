Safety and Effectiveness Study of CPI-613 and/or Gemcitabine to Treat Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This Phase II study is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS). The secondary outcome measures are: changes in CA 19-9, Quality of Life (QOL), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and safety.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: CPI-613|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Any non-gemcitabine chemotherapies or best supportive care
Overall Survival (OS), Monitored until participants pass away, for an expected average of 6 months.
Changes in CA 19-9, CA 19-9 is monitored through blood work â‰¤2 weeks before treatment and after every third cycle (12 weeks) of treatment while on-study. CA 19-9 is a pancreatic tumor biomarker and a decline in CA 19-9 during and after therapy may be a marker of treatment efficacy., Monitored within 2-weeks before treatment, and every 3-cycles (months) during treatment|Quality of Life (QOL), QOL will be assessed as described by Aaronson NK, et al. 1993. It assesses how the various treatments and the disease affect the daily living abilities of the patient., Monitored before, during, and 1-week after treatment with CPI-613, for an expected average of 20 weeks.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Monitored during treatment with CPI-613 and until participants passed away, which will be an expected average of 6 months.|Safety, Safety assessment will be based on clinical signs, vital signs, blood work, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), etc., Monitored just before study treatment, and during study treatment at the end of every 4-week treatment cycle, for an expected average of 20 weeks.
Data from dose-escalated Phase I trials indicate that CPI-613 is safe and effective against metastatic pancreatic cancer (Lee et al. 2012; Retter et al. 2012). Accordingly, this Phase II trial is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Primary Outcome Measure:

- Overall Survival (OS)

Secondary Outcome Measures:

* Changes in CA 19-9
