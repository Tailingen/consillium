A Study of Belimumab in Treating Symptomatic Waldenstroms Macroglobulinaemia
Hypothesis; That inhibition of plasma Blys by the monoclonal antibody Belimumab will reduce both the survival of the lymphoplasmacytoid cells of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinaemia (WM), and their production of monoclonal IgM, resulting in a reduction of IgM paraprotein.
Symptomatic Waldenstroms Macroglobulinaemia
DRUG: Belimumab
Safety of Belimumab infusions in symptomatic WM, Patients are assessed every 28 days while on treatment
Reduction of IgM paraprotein, Serum Immunoglobulins will be tested every 28 days|Reduction of splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy, This will be tested every 28 days|Improvement in anaemia, Patients will be assessed every 28 days while on treatment|Correlate the degree of response with Belimumab levels, Pharmacokinetics will be performed on days 1, 15, 56, 168, 364
