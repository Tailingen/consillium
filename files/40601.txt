Study of Capmatinib in Chinese Adult Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutation
The purpose of the study is to learn whether the study treatment (capmatinib), which already shows efficacy and safety in non-Chinese patients, could help Chinese patients with controlling their lung cancer in a safe way. Participants will have a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung lancer (NSCLC), with a specific alteration in a part of their DNA (called mutation) of the MET gene, within a specific part of this gene called exon 14.

Participants who have advanced (or metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations in the MET gene but without mutations in the EGFR or ALK genes, who are aged 18 years or older will be enrolled in this study.

The study drug, capmatinib (also known as INC280), is an oral drug that is called a 'targeted' medicine, which means it targets particular processes that may not be working properly in cancer cells (called dysregulation). The dysregulation of the MET signaling in cancer cells of patients with NSCLC is believed to make the cancer worse. Capmatinib has been shown to selectively block the effects of the MET gene and therefore may help in keeping the disease under control, stopping cancer cells from growing.

This is an open-label, multicenter two-cohort phase II study. Chinese adult participants with EGFR wild-type (wt) (EGFR mutations that predict sensitivity to EGFR therapy, including, but not limited to exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement negative, advanced (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) NSCLC disease harboring MET exon 14-skipping (METÎ”ex14) mutations as determined by a Novartis central molecular laboratory will be treated in this study. Cohort 1 will include treatment naive participants and Cohort 2 participants who failed one or two prior lines of therapy in the advanced stage (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV). Each participant will receive 400 mg capmatinib tablet twice daily (BID).

The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR) by cohort as per the blinded independent review committee (BIRC) review. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1.

The primary analysis will be performed using full analysis set (FAS). The primary efficacy endpoint ORR will be estimated and the exact 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided by cohort.
