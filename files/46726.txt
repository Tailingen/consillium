CNS Involvement in Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMLBCL)
This is a retrospective, multicenter study designed to collect data on the diagnostic, therapeutic management and outcome of patients diagnosed with primary mediastinal lymphoma who have progressed or relapsed with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

Through this study, an international data set from 6 different countries will be collected on clinical factors, anti-lymphoma therapy administered alone or in conjunction with CNS prophylaxis, re-biopsy site information when available, dose intensity of lymphoma therapy received at recurrence, and patient outcome.

In addition, to better characterize the pathologic features of this rare entity, a central pathologic review of the initial diagnosis and, if available, histologic confirmation of recurrence will be performed.
