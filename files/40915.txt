Clinical Study of VG161 in the Treatment of Advanced Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This study plans to use 1.0×108PFU/day per cycle, intratumoral injection administration for 3 consecutive days, and 28 days as a cycle. Tumor imaging evaluation was performed every 8±1 weeks from the first dose of C1D1 until an event that met the criteria for treatment discontinuation occurred.

This study plans to use 1.0×108PFU/day per cycle, intratumoral injection administration for 3 consecutive days, and 28 days as a cycle. Tumor imaging evaluation was performed every 8±1 weeks from the first dose of C1D1 until an event that met the criteria for treatment discontinuation occurred. If the subject VG161 injection target lesion shrinks after treatment and can no longer receive intratumoral injection administration of this administered dose of VG161, after evaluation by the investigator, it is allowed to reduce the dosing dose or suspend the administration as appropriate according to the size of the injectable lesion. After the end of treatment, there will also be an end-of-treatment visit and a post-treatment safety visit. Subjects who end the study for reasons not attributable to disease progression will undergo imaging evaluation at the end of treatment (if no imaging evaluation is performed within 4 weeks) and have imaging every 3 months after the end of treatment until disease progression or death or initiation of new anti-tumor therapy (whichever occurs first) to assess the time to disease progression. After the end of treatment, the subjects will also receive survival follow-up once every 3 months, and the survival status of the subjects and subsequent anti-tumor therapy will be collected and recorded until death, loss to follow-up or 1 year after the last dose (whichever occurs first).
