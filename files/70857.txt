Effect of Perioperative Bronchodilator in COPD Patients Undergoing Lung Cancer Surgery
This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of perioperative dual bronchodilator therapy on post-operative pulmonary function and health-related quality of life (QoL) in mild-to-moderate less symptomatic COPD patients undergoing lung cancer surgery.

Investigators hypothesized that dual bronchodilator, as compared with placebo, would prevent reduction of pulmonary function after surgical resection and improve postoperative health related QoL.
