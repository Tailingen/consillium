T-Cell Therapy (EB103) in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
This is an open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety of an autologous T-cell therapy (EB103) and to determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) in adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) who have relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell NHL. The study will include a dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase.

To assess the Dose Limiting Toxicities of EB103., The incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) that occur within 28 days following EB103 T-cell infusion will be assessed. A DLT consists of any adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, concomitant medication, or intercurrent illness that occurs within 28 days following EB103 T-cell infusion and meets specified criteria as outline in the clinical protocol. The type, frequency, and severity of each DLT, AE, and abnormal laboratory value will be documented to assess the safety and tolerability of EB103., Time Frame: 28 days|Incidence rates of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of EB103., The type, frequency, and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be assessed and includes an AE that starts any time from initiation of EB103 administration through and including 90 days after EB103 administration.

Listing and summaries will be prepared for the following type of events: TEAEs, SAEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, treatment related AEs (conditioning chemotherapy, protocol-mandated procedures, or EB103), and AEs leading to death. AESIs, including but not limited to acute infusion reaction, CRS, ICANS, prolonged cytopenia, TLS, MAS/HLH, SPM, and hypogammaglobulinemia., Time Frame: 90 days|Incidence rates Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities reported for EB103., The type, frequency, and severity after Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities will be assessed and includes a laboratory abnormality that, compared to baseline, worsens by at least one grade with 90 days after EB103 administration., Time Frame: 90 days|To determine the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of EB103., The RP2D will be determined by the study Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) and chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) but will not exceed the MTD and the maximum administered dose (MAD). The RP2D will also be based on the manufacturing capability., Time Frame: 21 months
To assess the Overall Response Rate of EB103 in our study subject population., The Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) will be assessed., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To assess the Disease Control Rate of EB103 in our study subject population., The Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR of either Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) will be assessed., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To assess the Duration of Response of EB103 in our study subject population., The Duration of Response (DOR), defined as the time from first response to Progressive Disease (PD) or death will be assessed., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To assess the Progression-Free Survival rate of EB103 in our study subject population., The Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from EB103 infusion to PD or death will be assessed., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To assess the Event-Free Survival rate of EB103 in our study subject population., The Event-Free Survival (EFS) will be defined as the time from EB103 T-cell infusion to the earliest of the following events: death from any cause, PD, or starting a new anticancer therapy., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To assess the Overall Survival rate of EB103 in our study subject population., The Overall Survival (OS) will be defined as the time from EB103 T-cell infusion to the date of death., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of EB103 by measuring the peak exposure (Cmax)., The peak exposure (Cmax) will be measured in our study subject population., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of EB103 by measuring the time to reach peak exposure (Tmax)., Time to reach peak exposure (Tmax) will be measured in our study subject population., Time Frame: Up to 2 years|To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of EB103 by measuring the partial area under the curve (pAUC)., Partial area under the curve (pAUC) will be measured in our study subject population., Time Frame: Up to 2 years
This is an open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety of EB103 and determine the RP2D in adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age) who have R/R B-cell NHL.

The study will include a dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. A traditional dose escalation model (3+3 design) will be used to determine the RP2D, and once determined, the expansion phase will commence. Additional subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase to further confirm the safety profile of EB103 at the RP2D and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of EB103.
