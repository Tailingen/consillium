Long-term Follow up for Retinal Vascular Changes After Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery.
This study investigates the retinal vascular features, using optical coherence tomography angiography, in patients during one year's follow up after the endoscopic endonasal surgery to remove an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery
Study of vessel density of the retinal vascular network in patients underwent endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery, by optical coherence tomography angiography, during long-term follow up., To evaluate the changes in vessel density of the retinal vascular network 48 hours and 1 year after endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve, using optical coherence tomography angiography. The parameter analyzed by optical coherence tomography angiography was the vessel density of the retinal vascular network., one year
The role of the optical coherence tomography angiography to detect the changes in retinal vascular networks in patients after 48 hours and 1 year from the endoscopic endonasal surgery to remove an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

The optical coherence tomography angiography allows a detailed and quantitative analysis of the retinal vascular networks and to follow their changes over time.
