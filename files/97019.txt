Identification of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and aquagenic pruritus. Evaluation of the intensity of the aquagenic pruritus. Patients with value \>5/10 on the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale ) are proposed to participate to the protocole. Randomization between the two treatments. Duration of the treatment : 14 days. Regular evaluation of efficacity of the drugs (questionnaires). Evaluations will stop 2 months after the last intake. Blood samples will be collected before and after the intakes to study cytokine and neuropeptide levels.
