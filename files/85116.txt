Study to Evaluate Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treatment Landscape and Real-life Treatment Outcomes in Hungary: Analysis of National Health Insurance Fund Database
The objectives of this study are to describe patient demographics, clinical and disease characteristics and treatment patterns of Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia (CML) in Hungary.

The primary endpoint of this study is the overall survival of CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Hungary. The Overall Survival (OS) of all enrolled patients, OS by sequence pattern and by the number of treatment lines will be analyzed.

Secondary objectives are description of the treatment length in 1st and later lines, incidence and prevalence of CML, the patient demographics (as age, gender, comorbidities), average number of patients' comorbidities, most frequent comorbidities and patient number with comorbidities at baseline and at different treatment lines by investigated Thyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), distribution of the investigated TKI therapies by treatment lines
