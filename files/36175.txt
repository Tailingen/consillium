Whole Body Fluorine F 18 Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Scan and Whole Body MRI in Finding Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This phase 0 trial studies whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in finding bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan and whole body MRI, may help find and diagnose bone metastases.

PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance imaging|RADIATION: fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride|PROCEDURE: positron emission tomography|PROCEDURE: computed tomography|RADIATION: technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Uptake of fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride on PET/CT scan, Determine if increased uptake of 18F-fluoride on PET/CT scan is directly correlated to the metastatic tumor burden within the bones using bone scan as the reference standard., Up to 24 months|Incidence of focal MRI abnormality, Determine if focal MRI abnormality is directly correlated to the metastatic tumor burden within the bones using bone scan as the reference standard., Up to 24 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard.

II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference standard.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan, and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases. Patients with discordant imaging results (negative bone scan and positive PET/CT scan and/or MRI) undergo additional imaging at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
