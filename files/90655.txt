Diagnostic Accuracy of EBV C Promoter Methylation Kit in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This clinical study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) C promoter methylation detection kit. All participants will undergo a series of diagnostic tests including VCA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA, and EBV-DNA assays. Additionally, nasopharyngeal swabs will be analyzed for EBV C promoter methylation. Confirmatory biopsy will be performed on all patients to establish a definitive diagnosis. This comprehensive approach seeks to assess the effectiveness of the methylation detection kit in a clinical setting.

Sensitivity of Epstein-Barr Virus C Promoter Methylation in Diagnosing Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Measure the sensitivity of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) C Promoter Methylation as a diagnostic marker for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Sensitivity will be calculated as the proportion of true positive cases (patients correctly identified with NPC) out of the total number of actual NPC cases., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks|Specificity of Epstein-Barr Virus C Promoter Methylation in Diagnosing Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Measure the specificity of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) C Promoter Methylation as a diagnostic marker for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Specificity will be calculated as the proportion of true negative cases (patients correctly identified without NPC) out of the total number of actual non-NPC cases., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks|Kappa Value of Epstein-Barr Virus C Promoter Methylation in Diagnosing Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Evaluate the agreement between Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) C Promoter Methylation and the gold standard diagnostic methods for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) using the Kappa statistic. The Kappa value will indicate the consistency and reliability of EBV C Promoter Methylation as a diagnostic tool compared to established diagnostic criteria., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks|Concordance Analysis of Test Reagents and Sequencing Methods in EBV C Promoter Methylation Detection, This measure evaluates the positive, negative, and total concordance rates, as well as the Kappa Value, between test reagents and two established sequencing techniques-Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing-for detecting Epstein-Barr virus C promoter methylation. The accuracy of these detection methods is assessed by comparing their results to those obtained through the widely used and mature technologies of Sanger dideoxy chain termination and pyrosequencing, often considered the "gold standards" for gene sequence analysis. This study aims to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the test reagents in identifying methylation of the EBV C promoter, using these established sequencing benchmarks., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks
Concordance Rates between EBV-Related Antibodies and EBV C Promoter Methylation, This outcome measures the agreement rates between EBV C promoter methylation and EBV-related antibodies in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma without a gold standard for comparison. It includes an evaluation of the positive concordance rates, negative concordance rates, and Kappa value, which might reflect limited conclusiveness but offer insight into the relative alignment of these diagnostic tests. This will help ascertain their comparative reliability and diagnostic utility in a real-world setting., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks|Concordance Rates between EBV-DNA and EBV C Promoter Methylation, This outcome measures the agreement rates between EBV C promoter methylation and EBV-DNA in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma without a gold standard for comparison. It includes an evaluation of the positive concordance rates, negative concordance rates, and Kappa value, which might reflect limited conclusiveness but offer insight into the relative alignment of these diagnostic tests. This will help ascertain their comparative reliability and diagnostic utility in a real-world setting., From enrollment to final diagnosis, up to 4 weeks
Dynamics of EBV C Promoter Methylation Before and After Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment, During follow-up consultations 1 to 6 months post-discharge, nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected to observe the dynamics of EBV C promoter methylation before and after treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 6 months, up to 1 years
