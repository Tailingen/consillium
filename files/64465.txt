A 2 Stage Trial of Lenalidomide (REV) in Asymptomatic Ovarian Cancer Patients With Increasing CA 125 in Late Relapse
Study in two stages, and with a sub-study.
Ovarian Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: Lenalidomide
Efficacy of lenalidomide as single agent, then DMT of lenalidomise with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, STAGE A: To determine efficacy of lenalidomide as single agent in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in second or third line.

STAGE B: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in combination with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin., Rate of Tumor Response + Stable Disease (at 4 months) / DMT
Safety profile of lenalidomide as single agent, then in combination, STAGE A:

* To determine the safety profile of lenalidomide (type, frequency, severity, and relationship of adverse events to study treatment).
* To assess time to progression (TTP).

STAGE B:

* To evaluate the safety profile of the combination therapy.
* To determine the response rate.
* To assess time to progression., Response rate, Stable Disease rate at 4 months / MDT
Stage A: To determine efficacy of lenalidomide as single agent in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in second or third line.

Stage B: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in combination with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.

Substudy: To investigate the impact of the lenalidomide on patients' immune system affected by cancer and to look for an immunizing marker which could be predictive of the activity of the lenalidomide in the solid tumors.
