Study of Dovitinib and Biomarkers in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or Advanced Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if dovitinib is an effective treatment for patients with advanced lung cancer or advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who have progressed on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Dovitinib
Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 100 months
Disease Control Rate, The total number of patients who demonstrate a response to treatment. Measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria., From start of treatment, up to 8 weeks|Progression Free Survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of the cancer that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From start of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Number of Patients Who Experienced Treatment Related Toxicities, Toxicities will be summarized by the type, severity (by NCI CTCAE), time of onset, duration, and outcome. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0., Starting at screening and then at every visit and then up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
The purposes of this study are 1) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of dovitinib and 2) to prospectively estimate the prevalence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling alterations in patients with advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or advanced CRC who have progressed on anti-VEGF treatment. Additionally, the investigators will make exploratory initial observations of the relationship between FGF signaling alterations and the clinical activity of dovitinib. This trial is expected to provide key biologic information that will inform the clinical development of dovitinib and provide initial evaluation of the analytic characteristics of these potential predictive biomarkers of its efficacy.
