Expanded Access to Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET in Patients With Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer
This is an expanded access program using 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11).

The primary goal of this expanded access program is to make 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging available to patients.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning. Gallium-68 labeled HBED-CC PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11) has recently been approved by the FDA for clinical use in a formulation utilized at the University of California in Los Angeles UCLA) and San Francisco (UCSF).

The production process for 68Ga-PSMA-11 at the University of Michigan (UM) is different and not FDA approved. This expanded access program was established to allow a continued use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 produced at the University of Michigan for clinical management for prostate cancer at the University of Michigan.
