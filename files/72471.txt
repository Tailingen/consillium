Vyxeos Plus Gilteritinib in Relapsed or Refractory, FLT3-Mutated AML
This study combines vyxeos and gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Vyxeos and gilteritinib will be given as induction therapy. Those patients entering a complete remission or a complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery will be allowed to proceed to consolidation therapy with vyxeos and gilteritinib. Those patients who do not proceed to an allogeneic stem cell transplant for any reason are able to enter the maintenance phase of this trial using daily gilteritinib
Acute Myeloid Leukemia With FLT3/ITD Mutation
DRUG: Gilteritinib|DRUG: Vyxeos
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose escalation will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Vyxeos plus Gilteritinib. The MTD is the highest dose of the combination therapy that dose not cause unacceptable side effects., Up to 18 months
Complete Remission Rate, Rate of complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). The definition of CR and CRi is based on the European LeukemiaNet 2017 Response Criteria, Up to 18 months|Event free survival (EFS), Event free survival is determined as the duration of time from start of treatment to the time of cancer recurrence., Up to 18 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to the time of death from any cause or date of last contact., Up to 5 years
