A Study of Adult Participants With BRAF V600 Mutation-Positive Advanced Melanoma Treated With Cobimetinib (Cotellic®) During the French Early Access Program (Temporary Authorization for Use [TAU])
This is a multicentre, ambispective (both retrospective and prospective), and non-interventional study conducted in France in adult participants with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib (Zelboraf®).
Melanoma
DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Vemurafenib
Overall Survival (OS), From first intake of cobimetinib up to date of death due from any cause (assessed up to 18 months)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), From first intake of cobimetinib up to first disease progression or death from any cause (assessed up to 18 months)|Percentage of Participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Treatment According to RECIST as Assessed by Physician, From first intake of cobimetinib up to first disease progression or death from any cause (assessed up to 18 months)|Time to Cobimetinib Treatment Discontinuation, From first intake of cobimetinib up to cobimetinib treatment discontinuation (assessed up to 18 months)|Percentage of Participants by Treatments After Disease Progression or Permanent Cobimetinib Treatment Discontinuation, From disease progression or permanent cobimetinib treatment discontinuation up to overall study completion (assessed up to 18 months)|Retrospective Period: Percentage of Participants with Targeted Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Participants with following targeted adverse events will be reported: fever (pyrexia), diarrhea, hepatic abnormalities, creatinine phosphokinapse (CPK) increased, rhabdomyolysis, retinal serous detachment, decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), squamous cell skin carcinoma and keratoacanthom, renal failure, drug reaction (or rash) with eosinophilia and systemic syndrome (DRESS), rash not otherwise specified (NOS), and photosensitivity., From first intake of cobimetinib up to inclusion in the study (up to Day 1)|Prospective Period: Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), From first intake of cobimetinib up to overall study completion (assessed up to 18 months)
Concomitantly to the marketing authorization applications for cobimetinib and vemurafenib to European Medicines Agency (EMA) and United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in 2014, a French TAU program was initiated in February 2015. This study will enroll participants under this program.
