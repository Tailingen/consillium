Anti-CD19, Dual Co-stimulatory (4-1BB, CD3ζ) Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive Lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
Autologous, unselected CD3+ lymphocytes collected from apheresis, transfected with a lentiviral vector containing a 2nd generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a scFv recognizing CD19 and dual co-stimulatory intracellular signaling domains (4-1BB and CD3ζ).

Anti-CD19/4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T-cell: autologous, unselected CD3+ lymphocytes collected from whole blood or apheresis, transfected with a lentiviral vector containing a 2nd generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a scFv recognizing CD19 and dual co-stimulatory intracellular signaling domains (4-1BB and CD3ζ). All patients will receive lymphodepleting, conditioning chemotherapy in the form of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day) and fludarabine (30 mg/m\^2/day) on Days -5, -4, and -3 prior to a CAR T-cell intravenous, single dose administration on Day 0.

Phase 1b: Dose Finding/Escalation Dose Level 1: 0.5 x 10\^6/kg Dose Level 2: 1.0 x 10\^6/kg Dose Level 3: 2.0 x 10\^6/kg

Phase 2: Expansion Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy as indicated prior to receiving the CAR T-cell intravenous, single dose administration on Day 0 at the RP2D as identified during Phase 1b.
