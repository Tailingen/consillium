Study With T-cel Receptor Gene Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma
Patients with stage IV melanoma (also eye melanoma) will be treated with TCR transduced cells.
Stage IV Skin Melanoma|Eye; Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: TCR transduced T-cells|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood taking
Safety of the TCR treatment (according to CTCAE 4.0), Safety of the TCR treatment will be measured by noting the toxicity (according to CTCAE 4.0) that the patient experiences while on treatment., Baseline until release from the hospital, about 4 weeks.|Objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1., The objective response rate will be measured by RECIST 1.1., Baseline until progressive disease, median 6 months.
1-year progression free survival (PFS), 1-year PFS will we measured by the number of patients still free of disease after 1 year, using RECIST 1.1 to measure progressive disease, Baseline until 1 year after treatment.|Efficacy of induction of tumor specific T cell responses as measured by the persistence of Melan-A/MART1 specific T cells in peripheral blood samples, Efficacy of induction of tumor specific T cell responses as measured by the persistence of Melan-A/MART1 specific T cells in peripheral blood samples at several time points following adoptive transfer and in tumor biopsies when possible., Baseline until progressive disease, median 6 months.|Overall survival, Assessed up to 12 months|Systemic release of inflammatory cytokines after administration of transduced T cells compared to baseline, To study whether the infusion of MART-1 specific TCR (1D3 HMCys) transduced T cells will lead to systemic release of inflammatory cytokines., Baseline until progressive disease, median 6 months.
In this multicenter phase I/IIa trial 25 patients will be treated with non-myeloablative chemotherapy followed by adoptive transfer of autologous TCR transduced T cells, to study the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment.

Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 or 30 mg/kg/day x 2 days i.v.) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day i.v. x 5 days). Following this regimen, patients will receive one single intravenous adoptive transfer of transduced T cells starting with the first dose level.

* Dose level 1: 5x10\^7 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day
* Dose level 1a: 1,0x10\^8 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg/day
* Dose level 2: 2,5x10\^8 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day
* Dose level 3: maximum 1x10\^9 transduced T cells (depending on production yield). At time points 4, 8, and 12 weeks and every 3 months thereafter patients will be evaluated for response to treatment. After 3 patients have been treated in each dose level, but not before 8 weeks after the last patient has been infused with transduced T cells, the DSMB will be informed about the observed toxicity and efficacy within this cohort and decide, based on this information, whether the trial will be continued to the next dose level or will continue in the current dose level. The study will continue as the first stage (2-stage Simon), until a total of 16 patients have been enrolled and treated: if less than 2 responses are observed, the trial will be stopped and the conclusion will be that TCR lacks efficacy. Otherwise, the trial will continue its second stage. In addition, safety data after these first 16 patients will be evaluated by the DSMB. Any unexpected or serious (grade 3/4 or higher) toxicities during the trial, will be reported immediately to the DSMB and CCMO. Second stage: overall 25 patients will be enrolled (including the first stage): if the total number of responses for the two stages combined is less than 5, the trial will be stopped as soon as this is evident and the conclusion will be that TCR lacks efficacy.
