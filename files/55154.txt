The Impact of Neurocognitive Function in Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases Receiving Whole Brain Radiation Therapy
Brain metastases (BM), occurring in 10-30% of adult cancer patients, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality.The prognosis of patients with BM is generally poor, with a median survival time of 2-6 months. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been advocated as the primary treatment for metastatic brain cancer. WBRT injures small cerebral vasculature and neuropil,effects linked to imaging-defined white matter changes. However, information on the neurocognitive function(NCF) impact of WBRT in BM patients is also limited.This study aims to explore and evaluate the impact of NCF in patients with multiple brain metastases receiving WBRT.
