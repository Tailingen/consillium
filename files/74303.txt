Modufolin (Arfolitixorin) in Combination With 5-Fluorouracil Alone or Together With Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan in Colorectal Cancer
The purpose is to characterise the tolerability of Modufolin (arfolitixorin) in combination with 5-FU alone, in combination with 5-FU and Oxaliplatin, in combination with 5-FU and Irinotecan and in combination with 5-FU, Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab.

Colorectal Neoplasm
DRUG: Modufolin (arfolitixorin)|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Frequency and severity of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or other Adverse Events (AE), Primary safety variables will consist of monitoring and recording of DLTs and any significant AE that have led to adjustments in the therapy administration., The patients will be followed during 4 cycles of treatment (8 weeks).
The study will investigate the tolerability of Modufolin at four (4) different dose levels (30 to 240 mg/m2) in therapy combinations with the chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU, Oxaliplatin +/- bevcizumab, and Irinotecan.

When the selected phase 2 dose is determined, 40 additional patients, will be included in the study in order to acquire more data on the safety and tolerability of Modufolin at this dose level. Twenty (20) of these additional patients will be treated in with Oxaliplatin, 20 with Irinotecan.
