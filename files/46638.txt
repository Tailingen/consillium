F-18 TFB-PET Studies in Cancer Patients Undergoing NIS-containing Viral Therapies
The goal of this proposal is to perform first-in-man evaluation of the imaging probe F-18 tetrafluoroborate (BF4) as a PET imaging biomarker for expression of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) in tissues. .
Myeloma Before MV-NIS Treatment|Endometrial Cancer Before VSV-hINF-NIS Treatment
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: 18F-TFB-PET
Evaluate the uptake and distribution of the imaging agent 18F-TFB, This is a preliminary study and all analyses will be exploratory in nature., up to 10 days
Imaging Sensitivities, Comparisons will be made between 18F -TFB-PET/CT scans and 99mTc-SPECT/CT scans for feasibility to monitor expression of NIS in tumors following oncoviral treatments in the subjects, up to 10 days
The goal of this proposal is to perform first-in-man evaluation of the imaging probe F-18 tetrafluoroborate (BF4) as a PET imaging biomarker for expression of the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) in tissues. Imaging of functional hNIS activity in tissues with \[18F\]BF4 is anticipated to provide superior sensitivity and image quality to Tc-99m SPECT for monitoring hNIS transduction effected by viral therapies. The proposed work is designed to 1) evaluate the imaging feasibility in comparison with Tc-99m SPECT of hNIS expression in a) 10 myeloma patients treated with Edmonston Measles virus-NIS (MV-NIS) and b) 10 endometrial cancer patients treated with vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express human interferon-and NIS (VSV-hINF-NIS). This data will be necessary to support future regulatory submissions.
