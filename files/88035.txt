Study of a PD-1 Inhibitor (JTX-4014) in Subjects With Solid Tumor Malignancies
JTX-4014-101 is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation clinical study of JTX-4014 in adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumor malignancies, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

JTX-4014 is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1 and block its interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to augment anti-tumor T cell activity. This is a Phase 1, first in human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of JTX-4014 when administered as a single agent to adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumor malignancies. The intent of this study will be to determine the MTD and RP2D.
