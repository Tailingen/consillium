A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of NDI-219216 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if NDI-219216 is safe for patients, and if NDI-219216 might be a possible treatment for advanced solid tumors in the later phases of the study.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Is NDI-219216 safe and what kinds of side effects might it cause? What kind of effects does NDI-219216 have on the body? Does NDI-219216 have any impact on tumor size?

Participants will:

Take NDI-219216 every day by mouth. Visit the clinic 6 times during Cycle 1, 2 times during Cycle 2, once a month thereafter for checkups and tests while on the study, then one time for an end of treatment visit. After the End of Study, a follow up will occur but can be done on the phone.

Keep a diary of their tablet consumption and symptoms experienced.
