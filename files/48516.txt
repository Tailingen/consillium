A Modified Dose of Rabbit Anti-thymocyte Globulin (rATG) in Children and Adults Receiving Treatment to Help Prepare Their Bodies for a Bone Marrow Transplant
The purpose of this study is to see if conditioning regimens that include personalized rabbit ATG (P-rATG) help the immune system recover sooner and decrease the chances of transplant-related side effects. Participants in this study will be children and adults who have acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and will receive a standard conditioning regimen to prepare the body for an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). The conditioning regimen will include r-ATG, one of two combinations of chemotherapy, and possibly total body irradiation (TBI).
