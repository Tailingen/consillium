Study Evaluating the Tolerance and Biologic Activity of Oral Ciclopirox Olamine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancy
This is an open-label, single arm study. Approximately 3-30 patients will be enrolled. Patients will receive Oral ciclopirox olamine (aqueous suspension), initial starting dose of 5 mg/m2/day administered as a single dose daily for 5 days. Three patients will initially be treated at each dose level in sequential cohorts. Dose escalation will continue for each subsequent cohort based on toxicity and plasma drug concentrations observed during the previous cohort. Dose escalation will continue until establishment of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been met.

Patients who have demonstrated response to treatment, up to 6 total cycles of treatment may be administered. If additional cycles are warranted, ciclopirox olamine will be given at the same dose and frequency as the patient initially received.
