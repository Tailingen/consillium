Evaluation of Safety of Cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in Patients With Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the safety of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer

Secondary Objectives:

1. To describe the use of cabazitaxel (Jevtana) in combination with oral prednisolone for the treatment of patients with metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
2. To describe patient profile in terms of demography, disease characteristics and prior treatment history
3. To describe efficacy outcomes: radiological response (if available) using Recist criteria V 1.1 and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response
Prostate Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: CABAZITAXEL XRP6258|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Prednisolone
Number of patients with Related Serious Adverse Events, up to13 months
Evaluation of use of cabazitaxel in terms of treatment duration, number of cycles, dose modifications, up to 13 months|Radiological overall response (if radiological tumor assessment done) using Recist criteria, up to 13 months|Number of patients with at least 50% decrease in PSA, up to 13 months
The study consists of:

* a screening phase (maximum length of 7-day).
* a treatment phase with 21-day study treatment cycles. Patients continue to receive treatment until disease progression , death, unacceptable toxicity, investigator's decision or withdrawal of consent.
* a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.
