Maintaining Fitness During Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy for Oesophago-gastric Cancer: a Feasibility Study
Feasibility study to investigate the utility of a simple, home-based, exercise intervention during and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy but prior to surgery for esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma.

The principle aim of this study is to test the feasibility of utilising a home-based 'prehabilitation' exercise regimen in oesophago-gastric patients during preoperative chemotherapy and the period leading up to surgical resection. The investigators also hope to explore secondary outcomes of such a regimen, such as maintenance of fitness, the incidence of sarcopenia, muscle function and the outcomes of therapy. The investigators will explore the added value of blood-borne frailty biomarkers to objectively measure changes in physiology during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This will be tested using CPET, CT measured sarcopenia, grip strength and a small panel of biomarkers as secondary outcome and exploratory measures. Thus the main question is: 'Will patients participate in a home-based exercise programme during and after NAC for oesophago-gastric cancer?'
