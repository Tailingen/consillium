GAD-M Regimen As First-Line Treatment in Untreated Extranodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of High dose of Methotrexate combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M regimen) as first-line treatment in patients with de novo extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type

Overall Response Rate (ORR), 21 days (3 weeks) for one cycle, Efficacy was evaluated every two cycles, every 6 weeks, up to completion of treatment (approximately 6 months)
Progress Free Survival (PFS), up to end of follow-up-phase (approximately 5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), up to the date of death (approximately 5 years)
The number of participants with adverse events of grade 3-4, 21 days (3 weeks) for one cycle, Toxicity was evaluated every cycle, every 3 weeks, up to completion of treatment (approximately 6 months)|Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) DNA copies and antibodies, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|Plasma β2-microglobulin, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|Urinary microglobulin β2, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|lymphocyte count, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months) 21|Monocyte Count, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|C reactive protein, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)
Studies have shown that effects of P glycoprotein mediated chemotherapy resistance reduce the therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapy of NK/T cell lymphoma, and agents like pegaspargase and large doses of Methotrexate is not affected by the P glycoprotein. A number of reports suggest that gemcitabine combined with other chemotherapy drugs has good application prospect in the treatment of lymphomas. Dexamethasone is used in combination with other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which may be implicated in the development or growth of some cancers. So we explored to evaluate the efficacy and safety of High dose of methotrexate combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M regimen) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
