Dolasetron for the Prevention of CINV in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a prospective, multicenter, real-world study of 500 participants with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are scheduled to receive dolasetron mesylate injection for prophylaxis against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

This study did not make any decision or process intervention for clinical antitumor therapy. The study plans to observe the control of nausea and vomiting within 120 h (D1-D5) after receiving induction chemotherapy and the safety within 7 days (or until this discharge, whichever occurs first).

During the whole study, demographic data, history of motion sickness, ECOG score, complications, name and dosage of anti-tumor therapy drugs, this antiemetic regimen, nausea and vomiting, rescue therapy drugs, combined drugs and adverse events were recorded.
Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting
DRUG: Dolasetron mesylate injection
Response (CR) rate during 0-120 hour after chemotherapy (global phase), CR defined as no vomiting or retching occurring within 120 hours after chemotherapy and no remedial medication being used, 0-120 hour after chemotherapy
Response (CR) rate 0-24 hour after chemotherapy (acute phase), CR defined as no vomiting or retching occurring within 24 hours after chemotherapy and no remedial medication being used, 0-24 hour after chemotherapy|Response (CR) rate 24-120 hour (delayed period) after chemotherapy, CR defined as no vomiting or retching occurring within 24-120 hours after chemotherapy and no remedial medication being used, 24-120 hour after chemotherapy|Proportion of subjects who did not vomit at 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy, Data were derived from subjects' diaries；Vomiting defined as even when very small amounts of stomach contents are expelled or retching （muscle movements in which vomiting occurs but stomach contents are not expelled), 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy|Proportion of subjects who did not use rescue treatment 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy, Data were derived from subjects' diaries；Rescue treatment includes commonly used antiemetic drugs, decided by the investigator, 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy|0-120 h after chemotherapy when vomiting (vomiting or retching) first occurs or rescue treatment is given (whichever occurs first), Data were derived from subjects' diaries；Vomiting defined as even when very small amounts of stomach contents are expelled or retching （muscle movements in which vomiting occurs but stomach contents are not expelled)；Rescue treatment includes commonly used antiemetic drugs, decided by the investigator, 0-120 hour after chemotherapy|Proportion of subjects free of nausea 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy, Data were derived from subjects' diaries, 0-24 hour and 24-120 hour after chemotherapy|The incidence and severity of adverse events (aes) within 7 days after chemotherapy (or until this discharge, whichever occurs first), Adverse reactions were judged by the investigator, 7 days after chemotherapy (or until this discharge, whichever occurs first)
Screening period: D-14\~D0 (D1 recorded on the day of chemotherapy drug infusion)

Subjects who planned to receive induction chemotherapy for the first time signed informed consent for this study, completed screening period examination, checked the inclusion criteria before drug infusion, and successfully screened subjects received CINV（chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting） prophylaxis regimen including Dolasetron mesylate injection.

Treatment observation period: D1\~D5 (beginning of study drug administration - 120 h after chemotherapy drug infusion)

Subjects who met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria were required to complete pre-chemotherapy CINV prophylaxis 30±10 min before induction chemotherapy drug infusion, as described in the administration protocol. The time of starting infusion of chemotherapy drugs (referring to other chemotherapy drugs except hormone drugs in the chemotherapy regimen) was recorded as 0 h, and the subsequent days were calculated as 24 hours.

Within 120 h after the start of chemotherapy infusion, if the subject had at least one episode of vomiting, retching, or nausea and complained of antiemetic therapy, the investigator evaluated the subject and gave remedial antiemetic therapy, which was determined by the investigator.

Within 120 h after the infusion of chemotherapy drugs, the subject or guardian will fill in the occurrence of vomiting/retching and nausea daily through the subject's diary. If there were any omissions in the subjects' diaries, the researchers would remind the subjects to fill in the contents through phone calls and wechat.

Follow-up period: D6\~D7 (or until this discharge, whichever occurs first)

Adverse events were collected from D6 to D7 after chemotherapy drug infusion began (or until this discharge, whichever occurred first), and the relevant data were recorded in the study medical records and EDC（Electronic Data Capture） system.
