Effect of Coadministration of Sotorasib on the Pharmacokinetics of Rosuvastatin in Healthy Participants
A study to determine the effect of sotorasib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rosuvastatin, and to assess the PK of rosuvastatin when administered alone, in healthy participants.
Healthy Participants
DRUG: Rosuvastatin|DRUG: Sotorasib
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Rosuvastatin, The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose following administration of rosuvastatin on Days 1 and 6|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) of Rosuvastatin, The PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose following administration of rosuvastatin on Days 1 and 6|AUC From Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf) of Rosuvastatin, The PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose following administration of rosuvastatin on Days 1 and 6
Number of Participants Reporting Any Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Any clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and vital signs results were recorded as AEs., Day 1 to Day 41|Cmax of Sotorasib, The PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose following administration of sotorasib on Day 6|AUClast of Sotorasib, The PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose following administration of sotorasib on Day 6|AUCinf of Sotorasib, The PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods., Predose (Hour 0), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose following administration of sotorasib on Day 6
