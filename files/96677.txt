A Phase II, Open-Label Study of Clofarabine in Paediatric Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
This study is for a population of patients with few or no alternative options that was conducted to determine the response rate to clofarabine. Additionally the study will provide information on the safety profile, impact of overall survival, and impact on remission duration with clofarabine. It is a single arm study and has no comparator.
