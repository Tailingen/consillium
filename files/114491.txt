A Clinical Study of Intratumoral MVR-T3011 (T3011) Given as a Single Agent and in Combination With Intravenous Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral T3011 given alone and in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in partients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, first-in-human study of T3011 given via intratumoral (IT) injection as a single agent and in combination with IV pembrolizumab in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Phase 1 portion of the study is a single agent dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of T3011. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 15 to 30 evaluable participants enrolled. Once the RP2D is established Phase 2a Part 1 will enroll approximately 10 participants with locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma (in Arm A) 23 to 53 participants with HNSCC in Arm B, 40 to 80 participants with sarcoma in Arm C and 10 participants with cSCC in Arm D. During Phase 2a Part 1 the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of T3011 as a single agent will be evaluated. Phase 2a Part 2 will enroll in parallel to Phase 2a Part 1 once the RP2D is established. The safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of IT T3011 given in combination with IV pembrolizumab will be evaluated in 15 participants with histologically or pathologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC (Arm E). A rollover arm is also included in this study to allow participants who have documented progression on T3011 alone to receive T3011 in combination with pembrolizumab if considered eligible.
