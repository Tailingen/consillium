Developing Risk Prediction Model and Testing the Effect of Dual Task Walking on Improving Cognitive Function in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The aims of this three-year study are to explore cognitive function under different stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its related factors; and understand its disturbance and coping process caused by cancer-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) from patient perspective; and further to test effect of dual-task walking on improving cognitive function in CRC patients.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: dual-task walking
Self-report Questionnaire, The questionnaire includes 37 items to assess perceived cognitive function, Change from baseline cognitive function at 12 months|Neuropsychological battery test, Three neuropsychological battery tests will be used to assess cognitive function of executive function., Change from baseline cognitive function at 12 months|Neuropsychological battery test, One neuropsychological battery test will be used to assess cognitive function of attention, Change from baseline cognitive function at 12 months|Neuropsychological battery test, Five neuropsychological battery tests will be used to assess cognitive function of memory, Change from baseline cognitive function at 12 months
Self-report Questionnaire, The questionnaire includes 24 items to assess symptom severity, Change from baseline symptom at 12 months
Self-report Questionnaire, The questionnaire includes 15 items to assess fatigue level, Change from baseline fatigue at 12 months|Self-report Questionnaire, The questionnaire includes 20 items to assess frequency of depression symptom, Change from baseline depression symptom at 12 months
In the first phase, a cross-sectional design will be used to explore both subjective and objective cognitive functions under different cancer treatment trajectories of CRC and their related factors. Additionally, a risk prediction model for mild cognitive impairment will be developed by examining the effects of surgery and chemotherapy on cancer-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) , with the aim of identifying high-risk populations. A qualitative design will be employed to understand the disturbances and coping processes caused by CICI from the patient's perspective. A longitudinal design will be used to examine the effects of surgery and chemotherapy on cognitive function. In the second phase, we will develop a dual-task walking training program and use a randomized controlled trial to test its effect on improving cognitive function (memory, executive function, and attention) in CRC patients.
