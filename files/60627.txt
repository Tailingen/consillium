Phase (Ph) II Bevacizumab + Erlotinib for Patients (Pts) With Recurrent Malignant Glioma (MG)
Primary objective:

To estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of pts w recurrent malignant gliomas treated w erlotinib + bevacizumab.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate safety \& tolerability of erlotinib + bevacizumab among pts w recurrent malignant gliomas To evaluate radiographic response of pts w recurrent malignant gliomas treated w erlotinib + bevacizumab To evaluate pharmacokinetics of erlotinib when administered to pts w recurrent malignant gliomas; \& to examine relationship of clinical response to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR) expression, amplification, \& v-III mutation, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) \& phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in archival tumor samples
Glioblastoma|Gliosarcoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab and Erlotinib
6 Month Progression-free Survival, The proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months, 6 months
Radiographic Response, The number of participants with complete or partial response as determined by the following criteria:

* Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all enhancing tumor on contrast enhanced MRI scan. Patient must be off steroids or only on adrenal maintenance doses.
* Partial response (PR): Greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in the size (products of the largest perpendicular diameters) for all enhancing lesions. No new lesions may arise. Steroids must be stable or decreasing dose., Patients were followed for the duration of the study, with a median follow-up of 103 weeks for grade III participants and 141.8 weeks for grade IV participants|Pharmacokinetics of Erlotinib: Cmax, Day 1 and Day 42 of Dosing Erlotinib in Cycle 1: Maximum Concentration (ng/mL) (Cmax) for subjects receiving 500 mg (Enzyme-Inducing Anti-epileptic Drug, EIAED) or 200 mg (non-EIAED) Erlotinib, Day 1 and 42 of Dosing Erlotinib|Pharmacokinetics of Erlotinib: AUC, Day 1 and Day 42 of Dosing Erlotinib in Cycle 1: Area under the Curve (ng/mL.h) (AUC) for subjects receiving 500 mg (Enzyme-Inducing Anti-epileptic Drug, EIAED) or 200 mg (non-EIAED) Erlotinib, Day 1 and 42 of Dosing Erlotinib|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR), Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry for biomarkers., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - EGFR vIII, Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry for biomarkers., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - Phosphatase and Tensin Homologue (PTEN), Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry for biomarkers., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - Phosphorylated Protein Kinase B (pAKT), Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry for biomarkers., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - Phosphorylated Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK), Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry for biomarkers., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for biomarkers. The IHC expression score is the product of the percentage of cancer cells positive for VEGF multiplied by the overall intensity of staining, ranging from 0 to 3+. This produces a score ranging from 0 to 300., 1 year|Association of Biomarkers and One-year Survival - VEGFR-2, Archival tumor samples from grade IV participants were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for biomarkers. The IHC score is the product of the percentage of cancer cells positive for VEGFR-2 multiplied by the overall intensity of staining, ranging from 0 to 3+. This produces a score ranging from 0 to 300., 1 year
Exploratory, Phase II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial regimen consisting of erlotinib + bevacizumab among pts w recurrent malignant glioma. Signal transduction inhibitors, such as erlotinib, as well as anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, are expected to exert a cytostatic anti-tumor effect. Primary endpoint of study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. An important secondary objective is to further assess the safety of erlotinib + bevacizumab for pts w RMG. Pharmacokinetic studies included in protocol will evaluate impact of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) on metabolism of erlotinib.

If study demonstrates that combo regimen of erlotinib + bevacizumab is associated w encouraging anti-tumor activity among pts w recurrent malignant glioma (RMG), further assessment of regimen in additional ph II \& possibly ph III studies, will be considered.
