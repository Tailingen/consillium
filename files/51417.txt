Interventional Study on the Impact of the Hypnosis Used as Sedation or Relaxation in the Breast Oncologic Surgery
The aims of the study are to compare the recovering period between a group of patients with conventional sedation, a group using hypnosis as sedation during the surgery and a third group using hypnosis as a relaxation method and preparation but enjoying a classic sedation for their surgery.

Comparaison of pain ( different types of pain), consumption of pain killers ,anxiety and fatigue on day0,1, 8 after surgery and every. 3 months during the first 2 years of follow up.

Comparisons are also performed in substudies defined by treatments modalités. Inflammatory parameters s ( CRP_ C reactive protein, NLR- ( neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio) are measured on Day 0, 1, 8 and also salivary Immunoglobulins and different endocannabinoids.
Breast Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: General anesthesia|PROCEDURE: Hypnosis sedation|PROCEDURE: General anesthesia with preoperative session of hypnosis
Number of the days spent at the hospital post-surgery between the three groups, The aim of the study is to compare the recovering period hospitalisation and the different side effects (pain, anxiety, fatigue and consumption of pain killers ) during the post opérative period ( day 0, 1, 8- and at each follow up visit) between a group of patients with conventional sedation, a group using hypnosis as sedation during the surgery and a third group using hypnosis as a relaxation method and preparation but enjoying a classic sedation for their surgery, Day 0, 1, 8 and every 3 months for 2 years after surgery|Comparaison of inflammatory parameters measured on day 0,1,8: CRP ( c reactive protein) and NLR ( neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio), Blood test performed, Day 0, 1, 8
Substudy evaluation of salivary immunoglobulins and endocannabinoids among 50 patients (25 under general anesthesia and 25 under hypnosis sedation, Blood and salivary simples to observe if hypnosis modifies salivary parameters and endocannabinoids system, Simples collected on Day 0, 1 and 8 for endocannabinoids and salivary simples collected on Day 0 and 8
Hypnosis has already demonstrated benefits among breast cancer patients undergoing oncologic surgery. Different side effects were measured during the post operative period and at each follow up visit by physicians in order to carefully compare side effects in the 3 armes of patients..

Our hypothesis was that hypnosis sedation generates less perioperative inflammatory reaction.

A substudy of 50 patients was also dedicated to the investigation ofsalivary immunoglobulins and dosage of differents endocannabinoids
