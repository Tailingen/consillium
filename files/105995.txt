A Feasibility Study to Improve Colorectal Cancer Screening Among Racially Diverse Zip Codes in a Persistent Poverty County Using Navigation and Machine Learning Predictive Algorithms
The overarching goals of the "PCSNaP" Research Study is to support the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) of the University of Pennsylvania in carrying out its mission to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by designing, conducting, disseminating and evaluating an electronic health record-based automated identification program to target effective, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation to individuals who have not completed an ordered colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
