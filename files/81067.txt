Randomized, Open Label, Clinical Study of the Targeted Therapy, Palbociclib, to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the combination of palbociclib with anti-HER2 therapy plus endocrine therapy is superior to anti-HER2-based therapy plus endocrine therapy alone in improving the outcomes of subjects with hormone receptor-positive, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.

Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Investigator, 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, 24 months|3 and 5 year survival probabilities, Survival probabilities will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, 24 months|Objective Response Rate (OR: CR or PR), Defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death from any cause, whichever occurs first, 24 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR: CR or PR or SD ≥ 24 weeks, The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) on each treatment arm will be estimated by dividing the number of patients with CR, PR, or SD/Non-CR and Non-PD (for patients with measurable disease) ≥ 24 weeks by the number of patients randomized to the treatment arm., 24 months|Safety: Type incidence and severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v 4.0), Seriousness and attribution to the study medications of AEs and any laboratory abnormalities, 24 months|Patient Reported Outcomes, Time to symptom progression (FACT-B PFB-TOI), breast cancer specific health treatment related quality of life and general health status, 24 months|Incidence of CNS Metastasis, Compare the incidence of CNS metastasis between treatment arms, 24 months
Trough Plasma concentration of palbociclib, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, only for patients enrolled in the US, Palbociclib PK assessment: Day 22, Cycle 1, No; Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab PK assessment: Day 1, Cycle 4|PIK3CA genotype assessed in circulating cfDNA, Progression Free Survival (PFS) based upon investigator assessment of progression between patients in the two treatment arms in the subset of patients with tumors bearing a PIK3CA mutation., Day 1, Cycle 1, Day 1, Cycle 4, End of Treatment, approx 24 months|Tumor tissue biomarkers including genes, proteins, and RNA expression, Will evaluate baseline tumor and blood-based markers as predictors of benefit from the addition of palbociclib to anti-HER2 therapy plus endocrine therapy, Baseline
Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms following minimum of 4 and maximum of 8 cycles of induction treatment with anti-HER2 therapy. Arm A subjects will receive the experimental therapy, palbociclib, in addition to their current anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy. Arm B subjects will continue to receive the anti-HER2 therapy. It is expected that the addition of palbociclib to the first-line treatment of HER2 disease will delay the onset of therapeutic resistance and ultimately prolong the survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study is designed to treat the subset of patients with HER2+ disease who are also hormone receptor positive (HR+). It is also expected that palbociclib will modulate the endocrine resistance in HER2+/HR+ disease and potentiate the benefits of anti-HER2 therapy. Lastly, the current study includes a comprehensive molecular characterization of the disease at study entrance which will allow us to investigate the benefits of palbociclib in subsets of HER2+/HR+ disease such as PIK3CA mutant.
