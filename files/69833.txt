DS-8201a in HER2-positive Gastric Cancer That Cannot Be Surgically Removed or Has Spread (DESTINY-Gastric02)
This study will find out if trastuzumab deruxtecan is safe and works for participants with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

They must have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer:

* that cannot be removed surgically
* that has moved to other parts of the body
* that got worse during or after treatment that included trastuzumab

The study will enroll about 80 participants. Sites will be in North America and the European Union.

Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Independent Central Review Following Treatment With DS8201a in Participants With HER2-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastro-Esophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) was the defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), assessed by independent central review (ICR) committee based on RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Confirmed ORR based on ICR is reported., Up to 16 months (data cut-off)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Independent Central Review Following Treatment With DS8201a in Participants With HER2-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastro-Esophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) was the defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), assessed by independent central review (ICR) committee based on RECIST version 1.1.
