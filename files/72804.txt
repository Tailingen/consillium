A Randomized Study of the Effect of Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide With Mesna in the Treatment of High-Grade Adult Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Randomized study. All patients must be randomized to treatment on Arms I and II within 3 months of definitive surgery on Regimen A.

Regimen A: Surgery followed, as indicated, by Radiotherapy. Amputation; or limb-sparing resection followed by involved-field irradiation using megavoltage equipment with or without electron boost.

Arm I: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation and Urothelial Protection. Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Ifosfamide, IFF, NSC-109724; with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF,

NSC-614629; and Mesna, NSC-113891.

Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant chemotherapy.
Sarcoma
DRUG: doxorubicin|DRUG: ifosfamide|DRUG: mesna
Patients with primary, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities will undergo treatment of their primary tumor with either amputation or limb-sparing surgery and radiotherapy, and then be randomized to either observation or adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin and ifosfamide with mesna (with G-CSF) for five cycles beginning post-operatively. Local recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival will be evaluated in this randomized two-arm trial.
