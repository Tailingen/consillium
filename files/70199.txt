Evaluate the Safety Profile and Ability of TW1025 Oral Solution to Decrease Fatigue
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study to evaluate the safety profile and ability of TW1025 oral solution to decrease fatigue in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Fatigue
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: TW1025|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo
Change in fatigue scores at 9 weeks post-supplement initiation (+/- 1 week) compared with baseline, Change in fatigue scores at 9 weeks post-initiation of supplementation with TW1025/Placebo compared with baseline, assessed by using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale, Baseline vs 9 weeks
Number of Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events (side effects) in each arm will be counted and compared, 1 year after discontinuation of study treatment
Change in Fatigue Scores at Baseline vs at 18-weeks, Change in fatigue scores at 18 weeks post-supplement initiation and other on-treatment time points compared with baseline assessed by using the FACIT Fatigue subscale, Baseline vs 18-weeks|Change in Sleepiness Scores, Change in Daytime sleepiness scores, assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Baseline vs 9 weeks|Change in Quality of Life Scores, Change in Quality of life scores, assessed using the Quality of Life Linear Analog Scale (QOL-LAS), Baseline vs 9 weeks|Change in Overall Impression, The Subject Global Impression of Change is a 7-point instrument in which the patient rates the change in their overall status since beginning the study drug (ranging from very much better, moderately better, a little better, about the same, a little worse, moderately worse, to very much worse). It has been used extensively for determination of minimally clinically significant differences in numerous oncology clinical trials. Patients will be asked to fill out the Global Impression of Change scale at week 9 after starting study therapy only., 9 weeks|Levels of C-reactive protein in blood, C-reactive protein levels will be measured at baseline, and at weeks 9 and 18 following initiation of dietary supplement., baseline vs 9-weeks vs 18-weeks|Change in Gene Expression, Change in Whole blood gene expression profiles will be assessed using the NanoStringÂ® human immunology and the human inflammation gene panels at baseline and at weeks 9 and 18 of dietary supplementation. RNA-Seq or other methodologies may also be utilized to evaluate cytokine and immune cell signaling pathways, Baseline vs 9-weeks vs 18-weeks
The study population designed to be enrolled is patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with clinical evidence of recurrent or progressive HER2-negative metastatic disease and planning to begin a chemotherapy regimen of physician's choice for HER2-negative MBC who have evidence of fatigue.

An add-on study design to assess the superiority of TW1025 over placebo will be utilized in this study to evaluate whether TW1025 can decrease fatigue in patients with fatigue. The study will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized trial.
