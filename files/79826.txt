Study of Vorinostat in Combination With Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Advanced Sarcoma
This is a Phase Ib/II experimental, open-label, dose escalation, active treatment study designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of the combination.

During the Phase 2 portion of the study, we will assess progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),overall response rate (ORR), correlative endpoints, DNA methylation measured by microarray, and expression level of the genes as measured by microarray
Sarcoma
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
Phase I: Recommended Phase II Dose of Vorinostat, Recommended Phase ll dose of vorinostat that can be safely combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel. Gemcitabine and docetaxel were given at a fixed dose while vorinostat was dose-escalated using a standard '3+3' design. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as specific study drug-related events experienced during Cycle 1; only DLTs observed in a patient during the first cycle of treatment will be used for the dose escalation decision., During Cycle 1 of treatment|Six-month Progression-free Survival (PFS), Proportion of participants whose disease does not progress within 6 months of start of treatment (number of patients without progressive disease/total number of patients). Per RECIST v1.1, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. For non-target lesions, PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., Up to 6 months (per patient)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients with Complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\], per RECIST v1.1 criteria . Per RECIST v1.1, CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. For non-target lesions: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10mm short axis);PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, Up to 7 years and 7 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The median length of time from the beginning of study treatment that patients remain alive without progression of their disease (cancer). Per RECIST v1.1, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. For non-target lesions, PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., Up to 7 years and 7 months|One-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Proportion of participants whose disease does not progress within one year of start of treatment (number of patients with progressive disease/total number of patients). Per RECIST v1.1, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. For non-target lesions, PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., Up to one year (per patient)|Overall Survival (OS), The median length of time from the start of treatment that diagnosed study participants remain alive., Up to 7 years and 7 months|Six-month Overall Survival (OS), Proportion of participants alive at six months from the start of treatment., Up to 6 months (per patient)|One-year Overall Survival (OS), Proportion of participants alive at one year from the start of treatment., Up to one year (per patient)
Phase 1b

* To determine the dose of vorinostat that can be safely combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas.
* To characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of vorinostat when combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with advanced sarcomas (Exploratory Aim).

Phase 2

* To determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine and docetaxel in combination with vorinostat in patients with advanced sarcomas. The hypothesis is that gemcitabine and docetaxel + vorinostat will be safe and will improve the 6-months progression-free rates (PFR) of the combination by 20% (from 20% to 40%).
* To determine the objective response rate, progression-free, and overall survival of patients with advanced sarcomas treated with gemcitabine and docetaxel + vorinostat;
* To develop a predictive molecular signature of response to treatment in advanced sarcomas.
