Outcomes With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor for Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Stable Brain Metastases
Non-small cell lung cancer patients may have brain metastases at diagnosis. Patients with brain metastasis may contribute as poor prognosis factors. This trial aims to explore the efficacy and the safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in non small cell lung cancer patients with initial brain metastasis.
