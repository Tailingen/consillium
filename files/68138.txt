A Study to Evaluate Glofitamab as a Single Agent vs. Investigator's Choice in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of glofitamab monotherapy compared with an investigator's choice of either rituximab plus bendamustine (BR), or lenalidomide with rituximab (R-Len) in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
Lymphoma
DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Tocilizumab
Progression-free survival (PFS), From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (up to approximately 24 months)
Complete response (CR) rate, Up to approximately 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS), From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 24 months)|Time to deterioration in physical functioning/fatigue, From randomization to a 10-point decrease in physical functioning/10-point increase in fatigue compared to baseline (up to approximately 24 months)|Investigator-assessed PFS, From randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (up to approximately 24 months)|Investigator-assessed CR rate, Up to approximately 24 months|Investigator-assessed ORR, Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Complete Response (DOCR), From the initial occurrence of a documented CR until documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), From the initial occurrence of a documented CR until documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|Proportion of participants reporting each response option for item GP5 from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) subscale, Up to approximately 24 months|Time to deterioration in lymphoma symptoms, From randomization to the first documentation of a 3-point or more decrease in score as assessed by the FACT-Lym lymphoma subscale (LymS) questionnaire (up to approximately 24 months)|Proportion of participants experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement (3-point or more increase) in lymphoma symptoms as assessed through use of the FACT-Lym LymS, Up to approximately 24 months|Change from baseline in physical functioning and fatigue at each cycle as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions assessing five aspects of participant functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), global health status and quality of life (QoL), and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4-point scale that ranges from "not at all" to "very much," and the global health status and QoL items are scored on a 7-point scale that ranges from "very poor" to "excellent.", Up to approximately 24 months|Change from baseline in lymphoma symptoms at each cycle as assessed by the FACT-Lym LymS, Up to approximately 24 months|Serum concentration of glofitamab, Up to approximately 24 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Up to approximately 24 months
