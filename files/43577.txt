Autologous Vaccine for Follicular Lymphoma
This phase I study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an autologous idiotype vaccine manufactured by magnICON technology for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who are in complete or partial remission following non-antiCD20 containing salvage therapy. Data in terms of idiotype-specific immune responses will also be obtained.
