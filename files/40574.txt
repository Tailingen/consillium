A Study of Focal Salvage High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Prostate Gland Only Recurrence
The purpose of this study is to learn more about what effects the use of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy on prostate cancer recurrence, seen by AXUMIN PET scan, has on prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|HDR
PROCEDURE: High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy
Number of patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels rising of 2ng/ml or above, Rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after focal salvage HDR in the setting of prostate only recurrence after primary non-surgical treatment, defined as a PSA rise of 2 ng/ml or more above the nadir at 6 months, 6 Months|Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Measured by adverse event severity and quantity, 6 Months
Progression Free Survival, Measure of time from study enrollment until progression., 6 Months
In this study the investigator would like to better understand the use of high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy to target only recurrent prostate cancer that can be seen by AXUMIN PET scan. The use of HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not new, but it is a more recent advancement to use it to treat only what can be seen instead of the whole prostate.
