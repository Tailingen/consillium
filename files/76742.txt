Usefulness of Myocardial Deformation Imaging for Trastuzumab-induced Cardiotoxicity
Trastuzumab prolongs survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-positive breast cancer. Sequential left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) assessment has been mandated to detect myocardial dysfunction because of the risk of heart failure with this treatment. Myocardial deformation imaging is a sensitive means of detecting LV dysfunction, but this technique has not been evaluated in patients treated with trastuzumab. The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed by myocardial strain and strain rate (SR), are able to identify LV dysfunction earlier than conventional echocardiographic measures in patients treated with trastuzumab.
Left Ventricular Function Systolic Dysfunction|Cardiotoxicity
LV systolic dysfunction, LV systolic dysfunction was defined as following;

1. An EF unit drop of ≥10% from the baseline available echocardiogram or
2. Change in strain or strain rate : drop(decrement) corresponding to ≥1 SD of the relevant parameter assessed at the baseline available echocardiogram, 3-month F/U
LV systolic dysfunction, LV systolic dysfunction was defined as following;

1. An EF unit drop of ≥10% from the baseline available echocardiogram or
2. Change in strain or strain rate : drop(decrement) corresponding to ≥1 SD of the relevant parameter assessed at the baseline available echocardiogram, 6,9, and 12-month F/U
The investigators will prospectively evaluate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed by myocardial strain and strain rate (SR) and identify possibility of early detection of LV dysfunction in patients treated with trastuzumab.
