An Online-platform to Improve Patient-centered Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a GIMEMA Surveillance Program in Hematologic Malignancies
This is a national multicenter prospective observational study led by the GIMEMA. The GIMEMA-ALLIANCE Platform is also an online monitoring system for patients with hematologic malignancies aiming at helping hematologists in the early recognition and timely management of problems of their patients. Based on patient's rating of specific items (i.e. on the presence of clinically relevant problems or problems with adherence to therapy or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection), the Platform will automatically send alerts to the treating hematologist (and/or appointed members of the local Team). Physicians will be free to make any action they feel appropriate for the best care of their patients.
