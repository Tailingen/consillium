Efficacy and Safety of Precision Therapy in Refractory Tumor
This study is intended to evaluate efficacy and safety of targeted precision therapy in patients with refractory tumor, including rare tumor without standard recommended treatment and common tumor after multiple line of therapy.
Rare Tumor|Refractory Tumor
DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Afatinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Oxazolidine|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Dabrafenib|DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: PD-1/L1 inhibitor plus anti-angiogenic agent
Objective Response Rate, Proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of a predefined amount, including complete remission and partial remission, Evaluation of tumor burden based on RECIST criteria through study completion, an average of 2 months
Progress Free Survival, Time from treatment beginning until disease progression, Evaluation of tumor burden based on RECIST criteria until first documented progress through study completion, an average of 2 months|Overall Survival, Time from treatment beginning until death from any cause, From date of treatment beginning until the date of death from any cause, through study completion, an average of 1 months|Adverse Effect, Incidence of Treatment-related adverse Events, Through study completion, an average of 1 months
The individuals recruited in the present study are with solid tumor, mainly including two parts: first, rare tumor without standard recommended treatment such as atypical fibrous histiocytoma; second, common tumor after multiple line of therapy such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, etc. All patients have no any standard therapy based on NCCN guideline when recruiting. Next-generation sequence was used to detect druggable molecular event including gene mutation, gene fusion, amplification, etc. Then patients with molecular events were treated with corresponding targeted drug and followed-up, and not limited tumor type. PD-1/L1 inhibior plus anti-angiogenic agent was used in patients without durgguable targets. The efficacy and safety of these regimens were evaluated.
