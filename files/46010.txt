Predicting Response to Neoadjuvant ATEZOLIZUMAB Plus Carboplatin/Nab Paclitaxel in Resectable Non-squamous NSCLC
Exploratory study evaluating the potential of immune signature profiling for predicting response in patients with resectable Stage II, IIIA and select IIIB (T3N2 only) non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to neoadjuvant ATEZOLIZUMAB plus Carboplatin/nab Paclitaxel

Atezolizumab is given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg, day 1 of each 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant treatment phase, Carboplatin at an initial dose of AUC (area under curve) 5 mg/mL/min, intravenously day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant treatment Phase, and Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) at 100 mg/m2, intravenously day 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant treatment phase. Surgery after the 3rd cycle Atezolizumab / Carboplatin / Nab-Paclitaxel is standard procedure.
NSCLC Stage II|NSCLC, Stage IIIA|NSCLC Stage IIIB
DRUG: Atezolizumab 1200 mg abs day 1 q22 (iv)
Response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy with ATEZOLIZUMAB, Carboplatin and nab-Paclitaxel, determined by Major Pathologic Response (MPR) (≤10% residual viable tumor cells) (pathologic regression grading according to Junker criteria) rate, up to 5 months (after 9 weeks of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (3 cycles with 21 days per cycle) + surgery (4-8 additional weeks after completion of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy)
Response rate according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, determined by Δ tumor size and Δ lymph node size, pre-surgery after completion of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy|Response rate as determined by Δ PETactivity, determined by standardized uptake value \[SUV\] (standard uptake value), pre-surgery after completion of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy|Event-free survival (EFS), time to any of the following events, whichever occurs first: progression of disease prior to surgery as defined by RECIST v1.1, local or distant disease recurrence, or death due to any cause, up to 29 months after study inclusion; calculated from start of 1st cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, thus including three 21 day cycles+surgery, follow-up for 24 months after end of treatment visit; end of treatment visit takes place 6 weeks after surgery|Overall survival (OS), time to death due to any cause, up to 29 months after study inclusion; calculated from start of 1st cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, thus including three 21 day cycles+surgery, follow-up for 24 months after end of treatment visit; end of treatment visit takes place 6 weeks after surgery|Number of patients attaining surgery as planned, number of patients attaining surgery divided by the total number of patients included, up to 5 months
In early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), surgical treatment with curative intent is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard of care for fully resected stage II, IIIA, or select IIIB \[T3N2\] NSCLC to improve survival outcome as compared to surgery alone. Neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy has become a widely accepted alternative therapy. Chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings consist of platinum-based doublets. With the successful development of cancer immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC, several (neo)adjuvant studies of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently being conducted in resectable early-stage NSCLC.

The IREP study explores neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy with three cycles of atezolizumab, carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in patients with histologically confirmed and resectable non-squamous NSCLC Stage II, IIIA or select IIIB (T3N2 only). The primary endpoint of the study is the Major Pathologic Response (MPR) rate (≤10% residual viable tumor cells) at surgery. Secondary endpoints include EFS and OS, safety endpoints as well as analyses of molecular and immunological biomarkers that are predictive of response to the neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy treatment.

Atezolizumab is given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg day 1, carboplatin at an initial dose of AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously day 1 and nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 intravenously day 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant treatment phase. Subsequent surgery is standard procedure with standard lobectomy / bi-lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection.
