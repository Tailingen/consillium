Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of TRX-818 in Asian Solid Tumor Patients
TRX-818 is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. TRX-818 is a potent anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer cell lines. The objectives of this study are to determine the safety profile of TRX-818 including identification of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Asians and determine the recommended dose and regimen(s) to initiate Phase 2.

DRUG: TRX-818 capsules
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of TRX-818 in Asians, Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0., up to 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRX-818 in Asians, The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experiences a DLT after 28 days of treatment have occurred, with the next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing a DLT., up to 28 days
Preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), up to 112 days|Composite measure of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of TRX-818: AUC(0-last), AUC(0-last): area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to the time of the last measurable concentration, Day 1, 8, 15 for Cycle 1 only(each cycle is 28 days)|Composite measure of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of TRX-818:Cmax, Cmax: maximum plasma concentration, Day 1, 8, 15 for Cycle 1 only(each cycle is 28 days)|Composite measure of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of TRX-818: Tmax, Tmax: time to maximum plasma concentration, Day 1, 8, 15 for Cycle 1 only(each cycle is 28 days)|Composite measure of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of TRX-818: T(1/2), T(1/2): terminal elimination half-life, Day 1, 8, 15 for Cycle 1 only(each cycle is 28 days)|Time to tumor progression (TTP), up to 112 days
