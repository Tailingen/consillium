CCT301-38 CAR-T in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory AXL Positive Sarcomas
This clinical study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of CCT301-38 CAR modified autologous T cells (CCT301-38) in subjects with relapsed or refractory AXL positive sarcomas

This study is an open label, single-center Phase I dose escalation trial to assess the safety, tolerability, DLT and MTD of CCT301-38 cell therapy in patients with AXL positive relapsed or refractory sarcomas.

Subjects that meet inclusion criteria with positive AXL biopsy (IHC 1+ or greater in ≥50% tumor cells) will receive CCT301-38 according to the 3+3 dose escalation design.
