A Safety and Efficacy Study of INC280 Alone, and in Combination With Erlotinib, Compared to Chemotherapy, in Advanced/Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With EGFR Mutation and cMET Amplification
The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of INC280 in combination with erlotinib in the Phase Ib of this study, and to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of INC280 alone, and in combination with erlotinib, versus platinum with pemetrexed in the Phase II of this study, in adult patients with EGFR mutated, cMET amplified, advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: INC280 single agent|DRUG: erlotinib
Phase Ib: Frequency and characteristics of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) to the INC280 and erlotinib combination, To determine MTD and/or RP2D of INC280 in combination with erlotinib, First 28 days of dosing
Phase Ib: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR, proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial Response (CR+PR), Every 3 weeks, up to 5 years|Phase Ib: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR, proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or SD, Every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Phase Ib: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as time from the first documented CR or PR to first documented progression or death due to any cause, Every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Phase Ib: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as time from the first dose of study treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause, Every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Phase Ib: Number of patients with adverse events (AEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability of INC280 in combination with erlotinib assessed by change in vital signs, laboratory results and electrocardiogram (ECG)., Every 3 weeks, up to 2 years|Phase Ib: Plasma concentration-time profiles of INC280 and pharmacokinetic parameters, Composite pharmacokinetics of INC280 in the presence of erlotinib., 6 weeks|Phase Ib: Plasma concentration-time profiles of erlotinib in the presence of INC280, Composite pharmacokinetics of erlotinib in the presence of INC280., 6 weeks
The decision was taken to halt study enrollment with Cohort #3 in Phase Ib. Therefore, activities for the planned Phase II were not initiated.

This decision to stop further development of this combination was taken due to the challenge for enrollment in this very rare patient population along with the rapidly evolving disease landscape setting.
