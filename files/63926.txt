Umbrella Trial Testing Integrative Subtype Targeted Therapeutics in Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn if adding a new drug that is targeted at a specific genetic change found in some breast tumors pre-operatively will slow the growth of the tumor more than standard anti-hormone therapy used to treat this type of breast cancer. Different therapies are being tested based on the specific gene changes in the tumor. Not every tumor will have a gene change that is being studied.

Percentage change in Ki67, The primary outcome for this study is the change in digital pathology software-assessed quantitative Ki67 IHC from pre-treatment specimen to the on-treatment specimen. For analysis purposes, the change in Ki67 will be assessed on log-transformed values. The outcome will be expressed as mean and standard deviation., Measured pre-treatment and after treatment 15 or 19 days, based on the duration specified for the assigned therapy
Ki67 <10% on-treatment measurement, The proportions of subjects with Ki67 less than 10% after treatment. The outcome will be reported as a number without dispersion., 15 or 19 days, based on the duration specified for the assigned therapy
Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of investigational agent compared with standard endocrine therapy in in reducing Ki67 values based on digital pathology (QuPath) from baseline to on-treatment biopsy after an specific treatment duration (i.e. 14 days) in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors (tumor size ≥1 cm) with Ki67 ≥ 10%, for different integrative subtype categories identified at integrative subtype screening.

Secondary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of investigational agent compared with standard endocrine therapy on the proportion of subjects with Ki67 \< 10% after a specific treatment duration (i.e. 14 days)
