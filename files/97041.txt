Fourth Ventricular Administration of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (Nivolumab) and Methotrexate or 5-Azacytidine for Recurrent Medulloblastoma, Ependymoma, and Other CNS Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety, toxicity, and antitumor activity of fourth ventricular infusions of nivolumab plus 5-azacytidine for recurrent ependymoma and nivolumab plus methotrexate for recurrent medulloblastoma and other CNS malignancies.

Additionally, the study will explore immunologic responses to nivolumab.

The hypothesis is that local administration of nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is safe and will lead to even more robust treatment responses when administered following 5-azacytidine in patients with recurrent ependymoma or methotrexate in patients with medulloblastoma or other CNS tumors.
Recurrent Ependymoma|Recurrent Medulloblastoma|CNS Malignancies
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: 5-Azacytidine
Safety as assessed by the number of participants with a new neurological toxicity that is graded as Grade 3 or higher and that is probably or definitely related to infusions [that is, classified as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)], Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI common terminology criteria version 5.0. Adverse events not included in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) chart will be graded as follows:

* Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment required beyond prophylaxis
* Grade 2: Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require treatment.
* Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first line treatment.
* Grade 4: Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death., from start of treatment to end of treatment (about 12 weeks)
Number of participants who responded to therapy as determined by MRI imaging, baseline, within 7 days of completing final infusion (about 12 weeks)
