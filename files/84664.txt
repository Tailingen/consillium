Analyzing the Composition of Tears to Identify Cancer
This study will further evaluate the use of protein identification or protein pattern (signature) found in tears. We hypothesize that differences exist between the protein profile in tear fluid from patients with versus without cancer.

This study will further evaluate the use of tumor markers (substances in body fluids that may be elevated as a consequence of certain diseases or conditions) in the diagnosis of breast and/or other cancers., Collection of specimen and analysis with SELDI-MS
Specifically, this study will compare the protein profile in tear fluid from patients with breast, ovarian or colon cancer versus "normal male and female patients" for differences that show promise as a diagnostic indicator. If such differences can be found, then their diagnostic potential will be assessed and developed further in a subsequent study. The long-term goal of this project will be to develop a screening tool for the detection of breast and/or other cancers.
