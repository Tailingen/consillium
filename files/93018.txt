Study to Evaluate Effectiveness of Investigational Device in the Assistance of Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
This study aims to evaluate Effectiveness of Investigational Device, Lunit INSIGHT MMG, in the assistance of Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer during Screening Mammography Interpretation.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Mammography
Patient-level FBR (forced BI-RADS) area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Patient-level FBR (forced BI-RADS) area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to measure the effectiveness of Investigational Device between CAD assited and unassisted environment, Through study completion, an average of 6 months
The Lunit INSIGHT MMG is developed as a computer-assisted detection/diagnosis device based on deep learning technology. In this pivotal study, effectiveness of the investigational device, Lunit INSIGHT MMG, was examined by comparing the reading panelist's interpretation ability between CAD assisted and unassisted during screening mammography interpretation.
