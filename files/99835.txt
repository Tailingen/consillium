Evaluation of the Incidence of NTRK Gene Fusion in Adult Brain Tumours
This is a retrospective, mono centric, exploratory study to assess the incidence of a genomic alteration: NTRK gene fusion, in adult gliomas and brain metastases.
Glioma
OTHER: Glioma data collection|OTHER: Brain metastasis data collection
NTRK Fusion, Incidence of NTRK gene fusion identified by RNAseq in glioma and brain metastasis tumour samples., through study completion, an average of 12 months
NTRK Fusion identification in brain metastasis and primary tumor, Incidence of NTRK gene fusion identified in matched pairs of brain metastasis and primary tumor;, through study completion, an average of 12 months|Progression-free survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion, Progression-free survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion. Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of initial surgery to the date of diagnosis of progression. Progression will be defined according to the RANO criteria at 6 months, Month 6|Progression-free survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion, Progression-free survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion. Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of initial surgery to the date of diagnosis of progression. Progression will be defined according to the RANO criteria at 12 months, Month 12|Overall survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion., Overall survival in patients with NTRK gene fusion. Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of initial surgery to the date of death (or the date of last news) of the patient., through study completion, an average of 12 months|Specific radiological criterion (T1), Specific radiological criteria (T1) in patients with NTRK gene fusion in gliomas and brain metastases, through study completion, an average of 12 months|Specific radiological criterion (T2), Specific radiological criteria (T2) in patients with NTRK gene fusion in gliomas and brain metastases, through study completion, an average of 12 months|Specific radiological criterion (FLAIR), Specific radiological criteria (FLAIR) in patients with NTRK gene fusion in gliomas and brain metastases, through study completion, an average of 12 months|Specific radiological criterion (perfusion), Specific radiological criteria (perfusion) in patients with NTRK gene fusion in gliomas and brain metastases, through study completion, an average of 12 months|Incidence of other genomic alterations, Incidence of other genomic alterations identified by RNAseq, associated with the incidence of NTRK gene fusion, through study completion, an average of 12 months
Retrospective mono centric study of medical data (clinical, histological, molecular and imaging) from medical records and analysis of available excisional tissue samples.
