Perioperative Immune Function in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Cancer Surgery
At Zealand University Hospital, Denmark, the investigators will examine the immune function of patients with colorectal cancer before and after tumor resection.

The immune function will be assessed with functional profiling of the immune function (TruCulture®)

The study aims to describe alterations in the perioperative immune response to surgery. The generatied knowledge will lead to better under standing of perioperative pathophysiology.
