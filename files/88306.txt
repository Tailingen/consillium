An Open Label Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Lenvatinib with Pembrolizumab or Lenvatinib, Pembrolizumab and FLOT in the Neoadjuvant / Adjuvant Treatment for Patients with Gastric Cancer
This study is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lenvatinib with Pembrolizumab or Lenvatinib, Pembrolizumab and FLOT in the neoadjuvant / adjuvant treatment for Patients with Gastric Cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Lenvatinib 20mg|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib 8mg|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Levofolinate|DRUG: Fluorouracil
Major pathological response (MPR) rate, The MPR rate will be defined as the proportion of patients whose percentage of residual tumor in the stomach and lymph node decreased to \< 10%, as determined by a pathologist., 6 months
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, The pCR rate will be defined as the proportion of patients whose tumor in the stomach and lymph node completely disappeared, as determined by a pathologist., 6 months|Tumor response in the gastric primary lesion, The number of patients achieving endoscopic CR, PR, SD, or PD will be separately tabulated., 6 months|Radical resection rate, The radical resection rate will be defined as the proportion of patients who underwent a radical resection (R0 resection)., 6 months|Treatment completion rate until surgery, The treatment completion rate will be defined as the proportion of patients who started the protocol treatment, completed a three-cycle treatment with the study drug, and then underwent a radical resection (R0 resection)., 6 months|Treatment completion rate until adjuvant treatment, The treatment completion rate will be defined as the proportion of patients who started the protocol treatment, completed a three-cycle treatment with the study drug, and then underwent a radical resection (R0 resection) and adjuvant treatment was performed up to 14 cycles., 1 year 8 months|Event free survival (EFS), The registration date is the starting date, and is defined as the period until the event that occurs any of the following.

* Disease progression based on image evaluation using RECIST 1.1
* Recurrence based on CT or biopsy among patients with no postoperative lesions
* Death of any cause If it is determined to be exacerbated based on the image evaluation, the inspection date on which the image inspection was performed shall be the exacerbation date.

Secondary primary malignancies are not an EFS event. Patients for whom no EFS event has been recorded will be censored on the final image evaluation date., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), The period will be from the day of enrollment, as the starting date of the computation, to the day of death of any cause.

Surviving patients should be censored on the last day of PFS confirmed (Confirmation of survival by telephone inquiry will be acceptable. However, the fact of confirming survival should be documented in medical records.).

Patients who are lost to follow up should be censored on the last day when their survival is confirmed before being lost to follow up., 3 years|The incidence of adverse events, For adverse events due to protocol treatment, determine the frequency of worst grades in all courses according to CTCAE v5.0, the incidence of adverse events of Grade 3 or higher, and the incidence of adverse events of Grade 4 or higher., Up to 30 days after the last dose
This study is an open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase 2 clinical trial. Eligible patients are with previously untreated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma as defined by cT2-4 and/or cN+ without evidence of metastatic disease. Patients in the exploratory cohort will receive 3 cycles of 20 mg oral Lenvatinib daily plus 200 mg intravenous Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks as the neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery, and then 3 cycles of Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab followed by 11 cycles of Pembrolizumab monotherapy as the adjuvant treatment. Also, Patients in the FLOT cohort will receive 3 cycles of 8 mg oral Lenvatinib daily, 200 mg intravenous Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m2, Oxaloplatin 85 mg/m2, Levofolinate 200 mg/m2, 5-FU 2600 mg/m2) every 2 weeks as the neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery, and then 3 cycles of Lenvatinib ,Pembrolizumab plus FLOT followed by 11 cycles of Pembrolizumab monotherapy as the adjuvant treatment.
