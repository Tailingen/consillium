This is a phase II, prospective, single arm, non comparative study with crizotinib combined with bevacizumab in treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma cancer patients with ALK translocation or ROS1 translocation or MET amplification
Lung Adenocarcinoma Metastatic
DRUG: Crizotinib, bevacizumab
Progression-free survival (PFS), From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months
Overall Survival (OS), From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Response rate in patients with ALK translocation or ROS1 translocation or MET amplification, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Toxicity analysis: Incidence of Grade 3-4 Grade Toxicity graded according to National Cancer, Incidence of Grade 3-4 Grade Toxicity graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4.0, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months
This is a phase II, prospective, single arm, non comparative study with crizotinib combined with bevacizumab in treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma cancer patients with ALK translocation or ROS1 translocation or MET amplification. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC(Stage ⅢB/ⅢC/Ⅳ) with at least one measurable tumor lesion will be considered eligible for the trial. All potentially eligible patients will be evaluated for ALK、MET and ROS1 by FISH or IHC or NGS to detect MET amplification or ALK translocation or ROS1 translocation After evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and after signature of informed consent form, all MET amplified or ALK translocation or ROS1 translocated eligible patients will receive crizotinib 250 mg BID p.o and bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
