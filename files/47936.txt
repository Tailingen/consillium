PREHAB - Improving Condition Before Surgery
The pilot research project is focused on the feasibility of a prehabilitation program for two groups of diagnoses (esophageal and stomach cancer, rectal cancer).
Cancer, Digestive System|Cancer, Rectum
BEHAVIORAL: Physical training|BEHAVIORAL: Muscle strength training
Number of enrolled patients, The number of patients who express an interest in being included in the study from all patients diagnosed and indicated for neoadjuvant therapy in the monitored period. the reasons for refusal to enroll in the study will be monitored., 3 months|Number of patients completing the program, The number of patients who complete the prehabilitation program by the time of surgery., 3 months|Individual patient compliance, Number of days when the patient wore the smart bracelet and performed or attempted to perform the exercise program out of the total number of days in the monitored period, 3 months
Changes in spirometry examination results, Changes in spirometry examination will be assessed, comparing the baseline values with the values after training (maximum tidal volume (ml/1kg of weight/1 min), anaerobic threshold (beats/min)., 3 months|Changes in the quality of life, Changes in the quality of life will be monitored using the EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). This questionnaire is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the oncologist, Number of patients with chemotherapy dose reduction or premature termination of chemotherapy, number of patients with complete chemotherapy, number of patients hospitalized due to chemotherapy toxicity, 3 months|Exercise program - number of steps/day, The number of steps taken by the study subjects in a day will be counted., 3 months|Exercise program - pressing force on the dynamometer, The pressing force on the dynamometer (in kg) will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the program., 3 months|Exercise program - InBody examination, The InBody examination (analysis of body composition in %) will be performed at the beginning and at the end of the program., 3 months|Exercise program - Body Mass Index, The value of Body Mass Index will be recorded at the beginning and at the end of the program will be assessed (in kg/m2), changes will be assessed., 3 months|Exercise program - perceived exertion, The perceived exertion will be assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE). RPE is based on the physical sensations a person experiences during physical activity, including increased heart rate, increased respiration or breathing rate, increased sweating, and muscle fatigue. The rating is from 6 to 20., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the anesthesiologist - ASA value, ASA value - the ASA physical status classification system is a system for assessing the fitness of patients before surgery. It is a five-category physical status classification defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the anesthesiologist - morbidity assessment, Morbidity assessment among the study population will be performed, using assessment of incidence and prevalence., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the anesthesiologist - preoperative analgesia, The use of preoperative analgesia will be recorded and assessed., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the anesthesiologist - postoperative opioid analgesia, The use of postoperative opioid analgesia will be recorded and assessed., 3 months|Parameters monitored by the anesthesiologist - pain assessment, The Numeric Pain Rating Scale will be used to assess pain. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults, including those with chronic pain due to rheumatic diseases., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - complete blood count, Complete blood count will be analyzed (g/L)., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - CRP values, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) will be assessed (in mg/L). C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein that is produced in the liver. The levels increase rapidly in response to acute inflammation., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - procalcitonin level, Procalcitonin levels will be analyzed (ng/L). This marker indicates the presence of infection., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - nutritional parameters, Nutritional parameters - the levels of total protein, albumin and prealbumin will be analyzed (mg/dL)., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - coagulation factors (aPTTp, Coagulation factors - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) will be measured (in seconds)., 3 months|Laboratory examinations - coagulation factors (fibrinogen), Coagulation factors - fibrinogen levels will be assessed (mg/dL). Higher and lower levels point to blood clotting disorders., 3 months
With the aim of achieving downstaging, downsizing, and reducing the risk of recurrence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, possibly chemoradiotherapy - i.e. neoadjuvant therapy is indicated in the preoperative period for patients with cancer of the upper digestive tract and rectal cancer.

Chemotherapy has a negative impact not only on the overall physical and mental condition of the patient but also on the quality of life and on the daily activities of the individual, especially in the period when the organism is facing an abnormal stress load in the sense of extensive surgical procedures.

Recently, attention and efforts to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality have increasingly focused on the preoperative period. The concept of prehabilitation, which is defined as an intervention improving functional capacity before an upcoming physiological stressor, appears as a way to contribute to this. This fact is evidenced by a number of published references.

The main aim of the study is to confirm or refute the feasibility of the prehabilitation program during neoadjuvant therapy in two diagnostic groups of patients:

* - Patients with cancer of the upper digestive tract
* - Patients with rectal cancer

The prehabilitation program will be implemented in the patient's home environment.

The study aims to answer the basic research question of whether selected patients will be able to complete a home exercise regimen during the preoperative period when they will undergo neoadjuvant therapy.

As part of the study, the program's security and feasibility will be tested.
