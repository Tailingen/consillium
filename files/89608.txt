Heterotopic Ossification in Abdominal Incision and Pancreatic Cancer
To investigate whether pancreatic cancer is the cause of heterotopic ossification of abdominal incision.
Cancer of Pancreas|Ossification, Heterotopic
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Bone alkaline phosphatase|RADIATION: Abdominal CT scan
Incidence of HOAI, HOAI is determined by CT, whose CT number is similar to that of the same spine., 12 months|Bone alkaline phosphatase, Preoperative tests were performed and every three months postoperatively, 12 months
Incidence of distant metastasis and local recurrence, Patients with pancreatic cancer were divided into HOAI and non-HOAI groups to determine whether there were differences in the incidence of distant metastasis and local recurrence between the two groups., 12 months
Overall survival, Patients with pancreatic cancer were divided into HOAI and non-HOAI groups to determine whether there were differences between the OS of two groups., 5 years
Heterotopic ossification of abdominal incision (HOAI) has long been regarded as a rare complication after general surgery. However,according to our retrospective analysis. HOAI was more frequently observed in the malignancy group (33/121 cases, 27.3%) than in the non- malignancy group. Because of the many biases in the retrospective analysis, the result was not widely shared.

The purpose of this prospective study is to confirm that pancreatic cancer is the cause of heterotopic ossification of abdominal incisions. According to postoperative pathology, the patients were divided into two groups: pancreatic cancer group and benign diseases group.The researchers will observe whether patients develop heterotopic ossification of the abdominal incision one year after surgery to conclude.
