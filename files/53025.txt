Neoadjuvant Toripalimab and Paclitaxel/Cisplatin on Pathological Response in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients
The aim of this study is to use the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor of Toripalimab, and chemotherapy agents of TP, as a neoadjuvant therapy to treat the patients with locally advanced OSCC, followed with radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, the major pathological response and safety will be evaluated as the primary surrogate endpoints, the 2-year survival rate and local recurrence rate will be the second endpoints.

Major pathological response, Major pathological response is based on the pathological examination on the post-operative specimens after neoadjuvant therapy., One year
2-year overall survival, The overall survival time refers to the time from initiating inductive therapy to death due to any cause., Two years|2-year tumor recurrence rate, The tumor recurrence rate is calculated using the number of patients with tumor recurrence divided by the total number of patients., Two years
In patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), comprehensive treatment is recommended, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and others. Pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy can reduce tumor burden, increase organ preservation rate, and reduce distant metastasis rate. Pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxcel and cisplatin (TP) has been used as one of recommended protocols in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell caricnoma, including OSCC. Anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapies have achieved exciting clinical outcomes in several malignancies, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and so on. Recently, pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy with combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy agents has been used with good pathological response, which might transfer to good clinical prognosis in patients with malignancies. However, pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy with combination of anti-PD1 and TP in OSCC patients has not been reported. The innovation of this study is the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor of Toripalimab, and chemotherapy agents of TP, as a neoadjuvant therapy to treat the patients with locally advanced OSCC, followed with radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, the major pathological response and safety will be evaluated as the primary surrogate endpoints, the 2-year survival rate and local recurrence rate will be the second endpoints.
