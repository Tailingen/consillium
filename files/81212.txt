Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent B-Cell Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mouse DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of mouse DNA vaccine in treating patients with recurrent B-cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: plasmid DNA vaccine therapy|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: immunoenzyme technique
Safety and immunogenicity, 2 years
Antibody and T-cell responses against CD20, 2 years|Antitumor response, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular DNA vaccination with a plasmid DNA vector expressing the mouse extracellular domain of CD20, namely pINGmminiCD20. Doses of pING-mminiCD20 will be escalated by group to determine the optimal biological dose.

Secondary

* To evaluate antibody and T-cell responses to CD20 after vaccination.
* To observe patients for evidence of any antitumor response generated after vaccination.

OUTLINE: The entire immunization schedule comprises five injections administered every three weeks (for a total of approximately four and one half months). After the second injection, blood will be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses. After the fifth and final injection, blood will again be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses.
