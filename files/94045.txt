Effect of Gastrectomy and Anastomosis on Diabetes and Hypertension in Early Gastric Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the extent of gastrectomy and anastomosis type affect chronic metabolic disease such as diabetes and hypertension in early gastric cancer patients.
Early Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection
Proportion of patients who quit previous medication for diabetes because of improved disease, proportion of patients who quit their previous medication for diabetes because of improved disease after operation among all patients who underwent gastrectomy for early gastric cancer with diabetes., 5 year after operation|Proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension because of improved disease, Proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension because of improved disease among the patients who diagnosed as early gastric cancer and hypertension, 5 years after operation
difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for diabetes between patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and those who underwent total gastrectomy, difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for diabetes between patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and those who underwent total gastrectomy, 5 years after operation|difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for diabetes according to anastomosis, difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for diabetes among patients who underwent gastroduodenostomy and loop gastrojejunostomy and Roux-Y gastrojejunostomy, 5 year after operation|difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension between patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and those who underwent total gastrectomy, difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension between patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and those who underwent total gastrectomy, 5 years after operation|difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension according to anastomosis, difference of proportion of patients who quit previous medication for hypertension among patients who underwent gastroduodenostomy and loop gastrojejunostomy and Roux-Y gastrojejunostomy, 5 years after operation|difference of serum levels of c-peptide, Ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin between before and after operation, difference of serum levels of c-peptide, Ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin between before and after operation in patients with diabetes, 1 years after operation
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the extent of gastrectomy and anastomosis type affect chronic metabolic disease such as diabetes and hypertension in early gastric cancer patients.
