Study of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Carfilzomib in Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Renal Disease
The purpose of this study is to see how the body and the cancer react to carfilzomib, including measuring the amount of the study drug in the blood at certain times following dosing. This study is being done in people with normal kidney function and those with end-stage renal disease to see if they respond differently to the study drug.

Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03, where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Fatal.

A Serious AE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:

* Death,
* Life-threatening experience;
* Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization,
* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
* Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
* Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are adverse events considered related to carfilzomib by the investigator, including those with unknown relationship., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug as of the data cut-off date of 12 October 2015; median duration of treatment was 14 weeks in the normal renal function group and 12 weeks in the ESRD group.
Specifically, the purpose of this study is to assess the influence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on area under the curve (both area under the curve, from time 0 to the last concentration measured \[AUC0-last\] and area under the curve, from time 0 extrapolated to infinity \[AUC0-inf\]) of carfilzomib 56 mg/m² at Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.
