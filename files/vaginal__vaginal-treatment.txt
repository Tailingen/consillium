Carcinomas of the vagina are uncommon tumors comprising about 2% of the cancers that arise in the female genital system.[
1
] Squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for approximately 80% to 90% of vaginal cancer cases and adenocarcinoma accounts for 5% to 10% of vaginal cancer cases.[
1
]
Rarely, melanomas (often nonpigmented), sarcomas, small-cell carcinomas, lymphomas, or carcinoid tumors  have been described as primary vaginal cancers. The natural history, prognosis, and treatment of other primary vaginal cancers are different and are not covered in this summary.
Distant hematogenous metastases occur most commonly in the lungs, and, less frequently, in the liver, bone, or other sites.[
1
]
The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system classifies tumors in the vagina that involve the cervix of women with an intact uterus as cervical cancers.[
2
]   Therefore, tumors that originated in the apical vagina but extend to the cervix are classified as cervical cancers.  For more information, see
Cervical Cancer Treatment
.
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from vaginal and other female genital  cancer in the United States in 2025:[
3
]
New cases: 8,070.
Deaths: 1,950.
Anatomy
Enlarge
Normal female reproductive system anatomy.
Risk Factors
Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for vaginal cancer include:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
SCC of the vagina is associated with a high rate of infection with oncogenic strains of HPV. SCC of the vagina and SCC of the cervix have many common risk factors.[
4
-
6
]  HPV infection has also been described in a case of vaginal adenocarcinoma.[
6
] For more information, see
Cervical Cancer Treatment
.
Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure
in utero
.
A rare form of adenocarcinoma, known as clear cell carcinoma,  occurs in association with
in utero
exposure to DES, with a peak incidence before age 30 years.  This association  was first reported in 1971.[
7
] The incidence of this disease, which is highest for those exposed during the first trimester, peaked in the mid-1970s, reflecting the use of DES in the 1950s. It is extremely rare now.[
1
] However, women with a known history of
in utero
DES exposure should be carefully monitored for possible presence of this tumor. (This association was mainly applicable to vaginal cancers diagnosed in younger women since adenocarcinomas that are not associated with DES exposure occur primarily during postmenopausal years.)
Vaginal adenosis is most commonly found in young women who had
in utero
exposure to DES and may coexist with a clear cell adenocarcinoma, although it rarely progresses to adenocarcinoma. Adenosis is replaced by squamous metaplasia, which occurs naturally, and requires follow-up but not removal.
History of hysterectomy.
Women who have had a hysterectomy for benign, premalignant, or malignant disease are at risk of vaginal carcinomas.[
8
] In a retrospective series of 100 women studied over 30 years, 50% had undergone hysterectomy before the diagnosis of vaginal cancer.[
8
] In the posthysterectomy group, 31 of 50 women (62%) developed cancers limited to the upper third of the vagina. In women who had not previously undergone hysterectomy, upper vaginal lesions were found in 17 of 50 women (34%).
Clinical Features
Although early vaginal cancer may not cause noticeable signs or symptoms, possible signs and symptoms of vaginal cancer include:
Metrorrhagia.
Dyspareunia.
Pelvic pain.
Vaginal mass.
Dysuria.
Constipation.
Diagnostic Evaluation
The following procedures may be used to diagnose vaginal cancer:
History and physical examination.
Pelvic examination.
Cervical cytology (Pap smear).
HPV testing.
Colposcopy.
Biopsy. If the cervix is intact, biopsies are mandatory to rule out a primary carcinoma of the cervix.  Carcinoma
of the vulva should also be ruled out.
Prognostic Factors
Prognosis depends primarily on the stage of disease, but survival is reduced among women with the following features:
Age older than 60 years.
Symptomatic at the time of
diagnosis.
Lesions of the middle and lower third of the vagina.
Poorly differentiated tumors.
In addition, the length of vaginal wall
involvement has been found to be associated with survival and stage
of disease in patients with vaginal SCC.
Follow-Up After Treatment
Similar to other gynecologic malignancies, the evidence to support surveillance after initial management of vaginal cancer is weak because of a lack of randomized or prospective clinical studies.[
9
]  There is no reliable evidence that routine cytological or imaging procedures in patients improves health outcomes beyond what is achieved by careful physical examination and assessment of new symptoms.  Therefore, outside the investigational setting, imaging procedures may be reserved for patients in whom physical examination or symptoms raise clinical suspicion of a recurrence or progression.

Stage Information for Vaginal Cancer
In This Section
FIGO Staging System
FIGO Staging System
The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) have designated staging to define vaginal cancer. The FIGO system is the most commonly used staging system for vaginal cancer.[

]
Stage I
The carcinoma is limited to the vaginal wall.
Stage II
The carcinoma has involved the subvaginal tissue but has not extended to the pelvic wall.
Stage III
The carcinoma has extended to the pelvic wall.
Stage IV
The carcinoma has extended beyond the true pelvis or has involved the mucosa of the bladder or rectum; bullous edemas as such does not permit a case to be allotted to stage IV.
IVa -  Tumor invades bladder and/or rectal mucosa and/or direct extension beyond the true pelvis.
IVb -  Spread to distant organs.
In addition, the FIGO staging system incorporates a modified World Health Organization prognostic scoring system. The scores from the eight risk factors are summed and incorporated into the FIGO stage, separated by a colon (e.g., stage II:4, stage IV:9, etc.).  Unfortunately, a variety of risk-scoring systems have been published, making comparisons of results difficult.

Treatment Option Overview for Vaginal Cancer
In This Section
Fluorouracil Dosing
Because vaginal cancer is rare, studies are limited to retrospective case series, usually from single-referral institutions.[
Level of evidence C2
] During the long span of time covered by these case series,   available staging tests and radiation techniques often changed, including the shift to high-energy accelerators and conformal and intensity-modulated radiation therapy.[
1
,
2
] Comparing treatment approaches is further complicated by the frequent failure of investigators to provide precise staging criteria (particularly for stage I vs. stage II disease) or criteria for the choice of treatment modality. This has led to a broad range of reported disease control and survival rates for any given stage and treatment modality.[
3
]
The following factors should be considered when planning treatment for vaginal cancer:
Stage and size of the lesion.
Ability to retain a functional vagina.
Presence or absence of the uterus.
Whether the patient has received previous pelvic radiation therapy.
Whether the lymphatics drain to pelvic or inguinal nodes or both, depending on tumor location.
Proximity of the vagina to the bladder or rectum. This limits surgical treatment options and increases short-term and long-term surgical complications and functional deficits.
Proximity to radiosensitive organs or organs that preclude radical resection without unacceptable functional deficits (e.g., bladder, rectum, urethra).
Radiation-induced damage to nearby organs may include:[
1
,
2
]
Rectovaginal fistulas.
Vesicovaginal fistulas.
Rectal or vaginal strictures.
Cystitis.
Proctitis.
Premature menopause from ovarian damage.
Soft tissue or bone necrosis.
Management of the extremely rare vaginal clear cell carcinoma is similar to  the management of squamous cell carcinoma. However, techniques that preserve vaginal and ovarian function should be strongly considered during treatment planning, given the young age of the patients at diagnosis.[

Radiation therapy
For patients with early-stage vaginal carcinoma, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these treatments are standard. Data from randomized trials are lacking, and the choice of therapy is generally determined by institutional experience and the
factors listed above
.[
3
]
For patients with stages III and IVa disease, radiation therapy
is standard and includes  external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), alone or with brachytherapy.  Regional lymph nodes are included in the radiation portal.  When used alone, EBRT involves a tumor dose of 65 Gy to 70 Gy, using shrinking fields, delivered within 6 to 7 weeks.  Intracavitary brachytherapy provides insufficient dose penetration for locally advanced tumors, so interstitial brachytherapy is used if brachytherapy is given.[
3
,
5
]
For patients with stage IVb or recurrent disease that cannot be managed with local treatments, current therapy is inadequate. No established anticancer drugs have demonstrated proven clinical benefit, although patients are often treated with regimens used to treat cervical cancer. Concurrent chemotherapy, using fluorouracil or cisplatin-based therapy, and radiation are sometimes advocated, based solely on extrapolation from cervical cancer management strategies.[
6
-
8
]  Evidence is limited to small case series and the incremental impact on survival and local control is not well defined.[
Level of evidence C3
]
Local control is a problem with bulky tumors.   Some investigators have also used concurrent chemotherapy with agents such as cisplatin, bleomycin, mitomycin, floxuridine, and vincristine without  improved outcomes.[
1
]  It is an extrapolation from treatment approaches used in cervical cancer, based on shared etiologic and risk factors.
Because vaginal cancer is rare, these patients are candidates
for clinical trials of anticancer drugs and/or radiosensitizers to attempt
to improve survival or local control.
 Discussion of clinical trials should be considered with eligible patients. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Fluorouracil Dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
9
,
10
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
9
-
11
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
12
-
14
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
15
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Treatment of Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia
In This Section
Treatment Options for VaIN
Current Clinical Trials
Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN), the presence of noninvasive squamous cell atypia, is classified by the degree of involvement of the epithelium, as follows:
VaIN 1 is defined as involvement of the upper one-third of the epithelial thickness.
VaIN  2 is defined as involvement of the upper two-thirds of the epithelial thickness.
VaIN 3 is defined as involvement of more than two-thirds of the epithelial thickness. VaIN 3 lesions that involve the full thickness of the epithelium are called carcinoma
in situ
.
VaIN is associated with a high rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and is thought to have an etiology that is similar to that of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).[
1
-
3
]
The cervix  and vulva are carefully evaluated because vaginal carcinoma
in situ
is associated with other genital neoplasia, and in some cases, may be an extension of CIN. Vaginal carcinoma
in situ
is often multifocal and commonly occurs in the vaginal vault. For more information, see
Cervical Cancer Treatment
.
The extent and type of surgical treatment needed is dependent upon anatomical location, evidence of multifocality, general patient comorbidities, and other specific factors (e.g., anatomical distortion of vaginal vault from prior hysterectomy).[
4
]
Treatment Options for VaIN
The following treatments  have not been directly compared in randomized trials, so their relative efficacy is uncertain.[
Level of evidence C3
]
Treatment options for
VaIN
include:
Laser therapy [
5
] after biopsy to rule out invasive components that could be missed with this treatment approach.
Wide local excision with or without skin grafting.[
6
]
Partial or total vaginectomy, with skin grafting for multifocal or extensive
disease.[
7
]
Intravaginal chemotherapy with 5% fluorouracil (5-FU) cream.  This option may be useful in the setting of multifocal lesions.[
5
,
8
]
Intracavitary radiation therapy.[
9
,
10
] Because of its attendant toxicity and inherent carcinogenicity, this treatment is primarily used in the setting of multifocal or recurrent disease, or when the risk of surgery is high.[
1
]  The entire vaginal mucosa is usually  treated.[
11
]
Imiquimod cream 5%, an immune stimulant used to treat genital warts, is an additional topical therapy that has a reported complete clinical response rate of 50% to 86% in small case series of patients with multifocal high-grade HPV-associated VaIN 2 and VaIN 3.[
12
]   However, it is investigational, and it may have only short-lived efficacy.[
13
]
Women with VaIN 1 can usually be observed carefully without ablative or surgical treatment because the lesions often regress spontaneously.  VaIN 2, the intermediate grade, is managed by careful observation or initial treatment. Although the natural history of VaIN is not precisely known because of its rarity, patients with VaIN 3 are presumed to be at substantial risk of progression to invasive cancer and are treated immediately. Lesions with hyperkeratosis respond better to excision or laser vaporization than to 5-FU.[

Treatment Options for Stage I Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Vagina
Treatment Options for Stage I Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Current Clinical Trials
The treatment options for stage I vaginal cancer have not been directly compared in randomized trials.[
Level of evidence C2
]    Because of differences in patient selection, expertise in treating local disease, and staging criteria, it is difficult to determine whether there are differences in disease control rates.
Treatment Options for Stage I Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Vagina
Treatment options for
stage I SCC of the vagina
superficial lesions less than 0.5 cm thick include:
Radiation therapy.[
1
-
4
]
These tumors may respond to intracavitary brachytherapy alone,[
1
] but treatment usually begins with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT).[
2
]
EBRT is required for bulky lesions or lesions that encompass the entire vagina.[
1
] For lesions in the lower third of the vagina, elective radiation therapy is often administered to the patient's  pelvic and/or inguinal lymph nodes.[
1
,
2
]
Surgery.[
5
]
Wide local excision or total vaginectomy with vaginal 
reconstruction may be performed, especially in lesions of the upper vagina.  In cases  with
close or positive surgical margins, adjuvant radiation therapy  is often added.[
6
]
Treatment options for
stage I SCC of the vagina
lesions more than 0.5 cm thick include:
Surgery.[
5
]
For lesions in the upper third of the vagina, radical 
vaginectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy should be considered.  Construction of a
neovagina may be performed if feasible and if  desired by the patient.[
6
,
7
]
In lesions of the lower third,  inguinal lymphadenectomy should be
considered.  In cases with close or  positive surgical margins, adjuvant
radiation therapy should be  considered.[

]
EBRT [
2
] and/or combination of interstitial and

For lesions  of the lower third of
the vagina, elective radiation therapy of 45 Gy to 50 Gy is given to the
pelvic  and/or inguinal lymph nodes.[

Treatment Options for Stage I Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Treatment options for
stage I adenocarcinoma of the vagina
include:
Surgery.
Total radical
vaginectomy and hysterectomy with lymph node dissection are indicated because the tumor spreads subepithelially.
The
deep pelvic lymph nodes are dissected if the lesion invades the upper vagina, and the
inguinal lymph nodes are removed if the lesion originates in the lower vagina.
Construction of a neovagina may be performed if feasible and if desired by the
patient.[

Treatment of Stages II, III, and IVa Vaginal Cancer
In This Section
Treatment Options for Stages II, III, and IVa Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Current Clinical Trials
The treatment options for stages II, III, and IVa vaginal cancer have not been directly compared in randomized trials.[
Level of evidence C2
]  As a result of  differences in patient selection, expertise in treating local disease, and staging criteria, it is difficult to determine whether there are differences in disease control rates.
Radiation therapy is the most common treatment for patients with stages II, III, and IVa vaginal cancer.
Treatment Options for Stages II, III, and IVa Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Treatment options for
stage II SCC and adenocarcinoma of the vagina
,
stage III SCC and adenocarcinoma of the vagina
, and
stage IVa SCC and adenocarcinoma of the vagina
include:
Radiation therapy.
External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone or in combination with interstitial and/or intracavitary brachytherapy.[

]  For example, EBRT for  a period of 5 to 6 weeks (including the pelvic
lymph nodes) followed by an interstitial and/or intracavitary implant for a total
tumor dose of 75 Gy to 80 Gy and a dose to the lateral pelvic wall of 55
Gy to 60 Gy.[

]
For
lesions in the lower third of the vagina, elective  radiation therapy of 45 Gy to 50
Gy is given to the pelvic and/or inguinal lymph  nodes.[

Surgery.
Radical vaginectomy or pelvic exenteration is performed with or 
without radiation therapy.[

Treatment of Stage IVb Vaginal Cancer
In This Section
Treatment Options for Stage IVb Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Stage IVb Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Adenocarcinoma of the Vagina
Treatment options for
stage IVb SCC and adenocarcinoma of the vagina
include:
Radiation therapy (for palliation of symptoms) with or without chemotherapy.
For patients with stage IVb disease, current therapy is inadequate.  No established anticancer drugs have demonstrated clinical benefit, although patients are often treated with regimens used to treat cervical cancer.
Concurrent chemotherapy using fluorouracil or cisplatin-based therapy and radiation therapy is sometimes advocated on the basis of results extrapolated from cervical cancer management strategies.[

]   Evidence is limited to small case series, and the incremental impact on patient survival and local disease control is not well defined.[
Level of evidence C3
] For more information, see
Cervical Cancer Treatment
.
Because stage IVb vaginal cancer is rare, these patients are candidates for clinical trials to improve survival or local control. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.

Treatment of Recurrent Vaginal Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Patients with recurrent vaginal cancer have a very poor prognosis.  Most recurrences occur in the first 2 years
after treatment.
Some patients with centrally recurrent vaginal cancers are
candidates for pelvic exenteration or radiation therapy.   In a large series, only 5 of 50
patients with recurrence were salvaged using surgery or radiation therapy.  All
five of these salvaged patients originally presented with stage I or II disease
and had tumor recurrence in the central pelvis.[

No established anticancer drugs have demonstrated clinical benefit, although patients are often treated with regimens used to treat cervical cancer.  If patients are eligible, participation in clinical trials should be considered.  Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
