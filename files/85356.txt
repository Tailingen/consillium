A Clinical Trial of Regorafenib in Patients With Pretreated Advanced Melanoma
There are in total 3 cohorts. Cohort A: 16 patients will receive a daily dose of 80mg regorafenib up until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Dose can be escalated intra-patient up to 120 mg if no AE with a grad \>1 at 28 days. Patients get a baseline evaluation and have a consultation every 2 weeks for evaluation during treatment. This evaluation consists out of lab tests, PET/CT (not bi-weekly), MRI (not bi-weekly) and physical evaluation.

Primary endpoint is the anti-tumor activity, secondary endpoints are the Overall Survival Rate, Progression Free Survival and the incidence and severity of AE and Health-Related Quality of Life.

Cohort-B: 16 patients who are being treated with BRAF-/MEK- inhibitors will receive additional daily regorafenib in combination with BRAF-/MEK inhibitors. Approved BRAF-/MEK- inhibitor combinations include dabrafenib/trametinib and encorafenib/binimetinib. An interruption of BRAF-/MEK-inhibitors dosing of maximum 4 weeks is allowed between the documentation of progression of disease on this therapy and the initiation of regorafenib study treatment. Dose of regorafenib is 40mg.

Cohort-C: 16 patients in Cohort-C will have interrupted treatment with any BRAF- /MEK - inhibitor combination for at least 12 weeks prior to initiating study therapy with regorafenib. At the time of initiating regorafenib study treatment at 40mg, patients will also resume treatment with encorafenib/binimetinib at its standard dosing regimen.

The first 6 patients enrolled in each Cohort (B, and -C) will be considered as a safety lead-in study population. If two or more serious treatment-related adverse events are observed among the first 6 patients, enrollment will be suspended (if applicable).

The risk/benefit for continuing enrollment will be evaluated and an interim safety report will be provided to the Medical Ethics Committee of the UZ Brussel. If less than two serious treatment-related adverse events are observed, enrollment will be continued without interruption to complete the phase II objective.
Melanoma Stage III|Melanoma Stage IV
DRUG: Regorafenib 40 MG Oral Tablet|DRUG: Triplet therapy
To measure the anti-tumor acitivity of regorafenib treatment in patients with advanced pretreated melanoma., Objective response rate (ORR; defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] at any time per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\], version 1.1, Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
To measure the progression-free survival (PFS) of study patients treated with regorafenib, Progression-free survival (PFS; defined as the time from the date of the first dose administration of regorafenib until the earliest date of documented disease progression \[per RECIST v1.1\] or death due to any cause), Through study completion, an average of 1 year.|To measure the overall survival (OS) of study patients treated with regorafenib, overall survival (OS; defined as the time from the date of the first dose administration of regorafenib until the date of death due to any cause), Through study completion, an average of 1 year.|Number of AE in study patients, To count the number of Adverse Events study patients have during the study., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.|To measure the severity of AE in study patients, Document the grade of all AE in study patients, expressed in grade 1 Mild, 2 Moderate, 3 Severe, 4 Life-Threatening, 5 Death related to AE, Through study completion, an average of 1 year.|To measure the Health-Related Quality of Life, There will be 1 questionnaire used to assess the quality of life. The generic health status of the patients will be assessed by means of the EuroQOL-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
