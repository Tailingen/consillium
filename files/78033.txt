BGT007H Cells for the Treatment of Refractory Digestive System Tumors
This is an exploratory clinical study evaluating the safety and initial efficacy of BGT007H injection in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic/refractory digestive system tumors.
Digestive Tract Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: BGT007H Injection
Dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）, Adverse events related to cell therapy were observed on 28 days after BGT007H injection , as specified in the protocol, From day 0 to day 28
Cmax, The amplification of BGT007H injection in peripheral blood peaked after administration, 12 months|Tmax, Number of days of peak BGT007H injection expansion after administration, 12 months|ORR, Proportion of patients who achieved pre-defined tumor volume reduction and maintained the minimum time limit.Imaging examination was performed after administration, and RECIST1.1 evaluation criteria was used for evaluation., 12 months|PFS, The time from the onset of leukocyte apheresis to the appearance of tumor progression or death., 12 months
The researchers designed a single arm, open, exploratory study to improve the "3+3" dose escalation. The maximum dose or the best effective dose shall be determined according to the subject and dose increasing test to verify the safe and effective number of cells per unit weight. The improved "3+3" dose increasing design was adopted, and BGT007H cells were set with 5 dose groups that were gradually increased for treatment evaluation. The dose groups were 2.0 × 10\^8cells，5.0 × 10\^8cells，1.0 × 10\^9cells，3.0 × 10\^9cells，6.0 × 10\^9cells。 Cell reinfusion will be carried out on day 0 (d0), and each subject will be observed for at least 4 weeks after receiving cell reinfusion (DLT observation period).
