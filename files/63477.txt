Trial Studying Chemotherapy in Nigerian Women With Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to determine what proportion of participants will achieve complete pathological response with epirubicin+ cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel +carboplatin. This will also examine the potential of using signals in the blood (biomarkers) to identify resistance to chemotherapy in Nigerian women with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

All enrollment to this trial will occur at sites in Nigeria. University of Chicago is serving as coordinating center and will be involved in data analysis.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: Breast Surgery|DRUG: Capecitabine
Percentage of Participants that Achieve Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate (Breast), How well does the study chemotherapy regimen of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel and carboplatin work to remove tumor cells in the breast. This will be determined by percentage of participants that do not have noticeable cancer cells in the breast after completing the chemotherapy regimen., 4 - 6 months from start of chemotherapy|Percentage of Participants that Achieve Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate (Lymph Nodes), How well does the study chemotherapy regimen of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel and carboplatin work to remove tumor cells in the lymph nodes. This will be determined by percentage of participants that do not have noticeable cancer cells in the lymph nodes after completing the chemotherapy regimen., 4 - 6 months from start of chemotherapy|Percentage of Participants that Achieve Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate (By Stage), How well does the study chemotherapy regimen of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel and carboplatin work to remove tumor cells based on stage of breast cancer. This will be determined by percentage of participants that do not have noticeable cancer cells in the lymph nodes after completing the chemotherapy regimen., 4 - 6 months from start of chemotherapy
Side Effects of the Study Pre-surgery Chemotherapy Regimen, Percentage of participants experiencing Grades 3 and 4 blood, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular toxicities., After 8 cycles of treatment (24 weeks)|Clinical Response, Percentage of participants achieving clinical response (CR and PR) during neoadjuvant period by breast ultrasound, 4 - 6 months from start of chemotherapy|Progressive Disease, Percentage of participants with progressive disease during pre-surgery treatment period, After 8 cycles of treatment (24 weeks)|Invasive Disease Free Survival (iDFS), Time to cancer returning or death, 10 years from start of treatment|Duration of Response, Time to cancer worsening or death, 10 years from start of treatment|Heart Related Side Effects of the Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy Regimen, Percentage of participants with Heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV or as confirmed by a cardiologist) and a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 10 ejection fraction (EF) points from baseline and to below 50%., 10 years from start of treatment
