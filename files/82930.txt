A Phase 1 Study of TRS005 in Patients With R/R CD20-positive B-NHL.
This trial is a multicenter, open, single arm, dose increasing and extended clinical trial. The dose was increased according to the "3 + 3" rule. Patients with recurrent or refractory CD20 positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were selected to evaluate the safety, tolerance (DLT, MTD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of TRS005 by intravenous drip.
CD20-positive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Recombinant CD20 monoclonal antibody-MMAE conjugte for injection
Neutropenia, Hematology DLT, grade 4 neutropenia, which cannot return to grade 2 or baseline within 7 days after G-CSF treatment, and the disease itself involvement / infiltration is excluded, At the end of cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|Thrombocytopenia, Hematology DLT, grade 4 Thrombocytopenia;, At the end of cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|Neurotoxic, Non hematological DLT,neurotoxic reaction of grade 2 or above, At the end of cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|MTD，Maximum Tolerated Dose, After the dose increment is completed, the incidence of DLT in each dose group is summarized and analyzed. The highest dose group closest to 1 / 3 of the preset incidence of DLT is MTD, At the end of cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)
ADA/Nab，anti-drug antibody(ADA) /neutralizing antibody (Nab), Evaluate the changes of anti drug antibody and neutralizing antibody produced by the subjects., At the first day of cycle 2、cycle 3、cycle 5 (each cycle is 21 days)|ORR，overall response rate, Summarize the number and percentage of objective remission (Complete remission (CR) or Partial remission (PR)), At the end of cycle 2、cycle 4 and cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Cmax, Peak concentration. Obtained directly from the measured data of blood drug concentration-time., At the day3/day5/day8/day15 in cycle one；and at the first day of Cycle 2-6 (each cycle is 21 days)|AUC0-t, Area under the curve from zero to the lowest detectable plasma concentration. Calculated by linear trapezoidal rule:

AUC(i, i+1)=(Ti+1-Ti)(Ci+Ci+1)/2, AUC 0-t is the sum of all AUC (I, I + 1)., At the day3/day5/day8/day15 in cycle one；and at the first day of Cycle 2-6 (each cycle is 21 days)|AUC0-∞, Area under the curve extrapolated from zero to infinity time. AUC0-∞=AUC0-t+Ct/λ z(Ct is the last measurable plasma concentration), At the day3/day5/day8/day15 in cycle one；and at the first day of Cycle 2-6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Tmax, Peak time. Obtained directly from the measured data of blood drug concentration-time., At the day3/day5/day8/day15 in cycle one；and at the first day of Cycle 2-6 (each cycle is 21 days)
The subjects were screened and examined according to the protocol before enrollment。The dose of the enrolled subjects was increased according to the following 7 dose groups: 0.1mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 1.5mg/kg, 1.8mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg and 2.3 mg/kg. (according to the data of the previous study, when the dose climbs to 1.5 mg / kg, there is a serious decline of neutrophils, which shall be subject to the principle of 3 + 3. If the dose group reaches 6 patients and the DLT is less than or equal to 1 case, it continues to increase sequentially (1.8 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and 2.3 mg/kg). Whether to continue the dose increase or not shall be discussed and decided by the researcher and the sponsor). The incremental process is divided into groups according to the principle of 3 + 3 dose increment. The subjects randomly receive intravenous drip of TRS005 in chronological order. Each subject first carries out a single dose study, and then carries out multiple continuous doses. The first dose is given once in D1. After 21 days of observation, it is decided whether to continue multiple continuous doses according to the situation. They are given once in C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C5D1 and C6D1 respectively, for a total of 6 cycles and 6 times.

Based on the data of pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of the previous 4 dose groups, the dose group of 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg or 1.8 mg/kg (when the maximum dose exceeds 1.8 mg/kg) will enter the extended trial phase and continue to complete 6 cycles of treatment according to the original research principles. It is expected that the number of research cases in each group will accumulate to 10, a total of about 30 cases; If 2 cases of DLT occur in 6 cases in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group, the dose increase will not continue. At this point, an additional 1.3 mg/kg dose group is required to enter the study, while the extended dose group is expected to select 1.0 mg/kg 1.3 mg/kg, with a cumulative enrollment of 12 subjects, for a total of 24 cases.
