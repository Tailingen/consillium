Remote Temperature Data for Early Detection of Febrile Neutropenia
BioSticker data is remotely tracked and displayed in a report termed the BioReport for retrospective data analysis. Typically, the biosensor collects data on an interval of \~1 minute and this data is collated and reported remotely back to the BioReport every 6 hours. More importantly, for future applications of the BioSticker for early detection of FN, there are ongoing efforts to implement real time reporting and alarms using remote monitoring services that could alert the patient that they need to seek medical care. There are no known deleterious effects from the BioSticker and it is now being widely used and tested in diverse applications including detection and contact tracing of COVID and others.
Hematologic Malignancy
DEVICE: BioSticker
Reliability of BioSticker compared to self-check, Patients will self-temperature check every 6 hours or at least two times per day, and will log these temperatures in a paper record with date, time and temperature noted., 28 days
BioSticker Impact on Patient reported temperature, Patients will report a single oral temperature of ≥38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of ≥38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained over a one-hour period to our clinic nurses or 24/7 on-call advanced practitioner and will be directed to the Emergency Department or clinic for initiation of antibiotics and FN work-up and management as per usual practice., 28 days|BioSticker Impact on Length of Hospitalization, Hospitalization during the 28 days will be extracted from the medical record, 28 days|BioSticker Impact on ICU transfers, ICU transfers during the 28 days will be extracted from the medical record, 28 days|BioSticker Impact on Delays in Chemotherapy, Delays in chemotherapy during the 28 days will be extracted from the medical record, 28 days
The BioIntelliSense BioSticker potentially offers a solution to these challenges through early and reliable detection of elevated temperature and perhaps other relevant physiologic changes. The BioSticker is an FDA approved medical device which can be worn on the upper left chest for remote data capture and can provide for up 30 days of continuous vital sign monitoring (see https://biointellisense.com as well as attached documents on BioSticker instructions for a full description and use instructions). The BioSticker detects the following:

* Respiratory rate, heart rate at rest and skin temperature
* Body position, activity levels, sleep status
* High-resolution gait analysis and fall detection
* Symptomatic events
