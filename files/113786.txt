Dose Escalation Study of GSK2820151 in Subjects With Advanced or Recurrent Solid Tumors
The study drug, GSK2820151, is a Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitor arising from a distinct structural class. GSK2820151 potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models. This first time in human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK2820151 in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The objective is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK2820151 in subjects 18 years or older with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Eligible subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until MTD is established. All subjects will receive study drug. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The duration of study will depend on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects' duration on study (withdrawal rates due to toxicity or progression). It is anticipated that approximately 30 to 50 subjects will be enrolled.
