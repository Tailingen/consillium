Comparative Evaluation of Two Different Radiosurgery
Randomized double arm phase III study to evaluate feasibility and safety of Gamma Knife radiosurgery and Linac Based (Edge) radiosurgery in brain metastatic patients
Metastases to Brain
RADIATION: Radiosurgery with Gamma Knife Perfexion|RADIATION: Linac-based Radiosurgery with EDGE
Incidence of symptomatic radionecrosis, two years
Local Control of Brain Metastases, two years|Disease Free survival, two years|Overall survival, two years
This is a prospective double arm phase III study to evaluate cerebral side effects following radiosurgery delivered by Gamma Knife Perfexion and Linac Based EDGE. In particular our primary objective is to evaluate rate of symptomatic radionecrosis from the two different modalities of radiosurgery.
