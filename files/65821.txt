Irradiation in Paediatrics: Neurocognition, Neuroimaging and Evaluation of Memory and Attention
This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric study designed to correlate the dose delivered to the hippocampus with declarative memory deficits 2 years after radiotherapy treatment in a paediatric population who had received brain irradiation between the ages of 4 and 12 for a brain tumour.

In order to meet this objective, several neuropsychological assessments consisting of parental questionnaires and cognitive tests will be carried out during the course of the study, at the following two stages:

* A 1st assessment at patient inclusion, i.e. 2 years after the end of radiotherapy treatment,
* And a second assessment 2 years after patient inclusion, i.e. 4 years after the end of radiotherapy treatment.

A retrospective assessment of the patient's neurocognitive level 1 year before the diagnosis of the disease will also be carried out at inclusion, with the parents completing a questionnaire specifically designed for the trial.

In addition, patients who have received their radiotherapy treatment at the IUCT-O will be offered participation in the ancillary imaging study. If the parents and the patient agree, multimodal MRI scans specific to the study (without injection of contrast) will be performed at inclusion and 2 years after inclusion.

Imaging and radiotherapy data will be collected in parallel using the PediaRT software used in current practice (collection of radiotherapy dosimetric data as well as standard MRI examinations pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at the 2-year and 4-year follow-up).

130 patients will be included in this study.
Brain Tumor, Pediatric
OTHER: Neuropsychological assessments:
A deficit of the declarative memory will be defined by a standard score of the Children' Memory Scale (CMS) ≤ 5, 24 months for each patient
Declarative memory will be assessed using the adapted EPIREAL test., 24 months for each patient|Declarative memory will be assessed by the autobiographical memory question., 24 months for each patient|The deficit of the procedural memory will be defined by a score of less than or equal to 10/20 on the last 20 trials (out of 50) of the probabilistic classification task., 24 months for each patient|The deficit of the procedural memory will be defined by a specific learning score less than or equal to zero of the adapted serial reaction time task (SRTT)., 24 months for each patient|Working memory deficit will be defined if at least one of the two subtests (Number memory (WISC-V) and Spatial memory (WNV)) shows a deficit., For each subtest, a deficit will be defined respectively by a standard score ≤ 5 and a percentile rank ≤ 5., 24 months for each patient
