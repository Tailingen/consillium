High Dose Radiation Therapy With Concurrent Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
To assess the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin for patients with locoregionally advanced non-small lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: high dose chemoradiotherapy
overall survival rate, survival time was measured from the date of study enrollment to the date of death or last follow-up, 2 year
toxicities, Acute toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4., 2 year
Local failure remains high in patients with locoregionally advanced non-small lung cancer. Given that a biological equivalent dose (BED)more than 100 Gy yields approximately a local control rate of 90% in early-stage non-small lung cancer, this BED or ever higher is logically required to control local disease for locally advanced non-small lung cancer. However, dose escalation is limited by radiation-related toxicity. Use of hyperfractionated radiation Therapy boost to residual metabolic disease as defined by positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) immediately after standard chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) using image-guided (IG) IMRT could potentially improve local control and perhaps survival
