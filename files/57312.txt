The Comparison Between Traditional Laparoscopy-assisted Surgery and NOSES in Radical Resection of Colorectal Cancer
This study is to compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of traditional laparoscopy-assisted surgery and total laparoscopic surgery with no incision (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, NOSES) for colorectal cancer and to find a better surgical method for patients.
Laparoscopy-assisted Surgery|Total Laparoscopic Surgery With no Incision (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery, NOSES)
PROCEDURE: traditional laparoscopy-assisted surgery|PROCEDURE: total laparoscopic surgery with no incision (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, NOSES)
the incidence of complications, All postoperative complications in the perioperative period will be classified by the Clavien-Dindo classification.The classification mainly focuses on the medical perspective, with major emphasis on the risk and invasiveness of the therapy used to correct a complication. From light to heavy, it consists of five grades (Ⅰ to Ⅴ), one month after surgery
the operation time, The descriptive name of unit would be minute (min)., in the perioperative period|the blood loss during the operation, The descriptive name of unit would be millilitre (ml)., in the perioperative period|Postoperative recovery of intestinal peristalsis, The descriptive name of unit would be hour (h)., in the perioperative period|Visual Analogue Scale/Score, A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain ( from 0 to 10)., in the perioperative period|the functional outcome of defecation, if there is incontinence, Anal incontinence was evaluated using the Wexner Continence Grading Scale , the score being calculated after the patients' completion of a daily defecatory questionnaire. Range is from 0 (normal continence) to 20 (maximum incontinence with maximum disturbance of lifestyle)., Three months after operation|3-year disease-free survival, three years after operation|cases converted to laparotomy, The procedure for cases who underwent laparoscopy-assisted surgery or NOSES can not go successfully, and then it will be converted to laparotomy. The number of all those cases should be recorded., in the perioperative period|The mean postoperative hospital stay, The descriptive name of unit would be day (d)., in the perioperative period
