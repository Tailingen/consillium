Telmisartan in Combination With Cytotoxic Regimens in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer
The primary study objective is to assess progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer receiving telmisartan plus selected standard of care chemotherapy regimens versus historical controls.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Telmisartan
Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time between the initiation of telmisartan to progression, as defined by RECIST criteria, on a computed tomography scan., 48 months
Treatment tolerability, Treatment tolerability will be quantified as the proportion of patients with a toxicity related to telmisartan and the proportion of patients who stopped telmisartan due to its toxicity, 24 months|Circulating tumor DNA changes, Peripheral blood will be drawn throughout the study and tested for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) damage. The goal is to understand tumor genetic changes in response to adding telmisartan to test if changes predictive of treatment response or failure can be detected., 24 months
This is an open label, single-arm Phase II trial of telmisartan plus selected standard of care chemotherapy regimens containing an anthracycline or taxane. The primary study objective is to assess progression-free survival.
