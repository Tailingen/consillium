Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Treatment of Physician Choice (TPC) Following First-Line Treatment of Lenvatinib in Subjects With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (uHCC)
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of subsequent systemic treatment of physician's choice (TPC) following the first-line lenvatinib treatment in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) participants.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Lenvatinib
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), From the first dose of study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately 3 months)
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up are censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remain alive are censored at the time of data cutoff. OS was to be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval., From first dose date until date of death from any cause (approximately 3 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) (and including the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 conventions for non-hepatic lesions) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of first-line lenvatinib treatment to the date of the first documentation of PD, or the date of death during the subsequent systemic TPC, whichever occurs first. PD is defined at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter \[mm\]) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was to be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval., From first dose date until PD or date of death from any cause (approximately 3 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP based on mRECIST (and including the RECIST 1.1 conventions for non-hepatic lesions) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of first-line lenvatinib treatment to the date of the first documentation of disease progression during subsequent systemic TPC. PD is defined at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. TTP was to be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval., From first dose date until PD (approximately 3 months)
