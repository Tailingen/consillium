Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Anti-PD1 Antibody (Pembrolizumab) for Oligometastatic Renal Tumours
This investigator driven study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological effects of combining pembrolizumab (MK-3475) an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The investigators hypothesise that the safety profile of this combination will be clinically acceptable.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiosurgery (SABR)|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Toxicities Measured Using CTCAE Version 4.03, Number of Participants with Grade 3 Treatment Related Adverse Events as determined using CTCAE version 4.03 criteria. This standard criteria can be found through National Cancer Institute (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). Grade 3 treatment-related events are high grade toxicities., Up to 24 months after SABR treatment
Overall Survival, From start of treatment until the date of death from any cause assessed up to 2 years|Freedom From Local Progression (FFLP), Freedom from local progression (FFLP) was defined as the absence of progressive disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, From start of treatment until the date of first local progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 2 years|Distant Progression Free Survival (DPFS), Percentage of Participants with Distant Progression Free Survival (DPFS), From start of treatment until the date of first distant progression or until the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed at 2 years|Overall Response Assessed Using RECIST 1.1, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 24 months|Pain Assessed Using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, The number of patients who reported a pain score \>0 at least once after treatment. Numerical Pain Rating Score, 0-10 scale with 0 representing no pain, to 10 representing the worst possible pain., From commencement of treatment up to 2 years.
Dual institutional, single arm, unblinded, phase I/II study.
