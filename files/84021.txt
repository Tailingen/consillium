Prevention of Paclitaxel-induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast Cancer Patients
Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) is one of the most dose-limiting side effects; it causes patients discomfort and pain and sometimes causes the termination of the chemotherapy cycles, leading to treatment failure. A lot of interventions have been tried to prevent PIPN, ensure complete administration of the chemotherapy cycles, and increase the survival rate. One of the promising interventions in the prevention of PIPN is Losartan. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) and is used to treat hypertensive patients. There is strong evidence from different preclinical studies and retrospective cohort studies that Losartan has a neuroprotective effect.

The purpose of our study is to investigate the efficacy of Losartan in the prevention of peripheral neuropathy associated with Paclitaxel treatment in Breast Cancer patients.
