Study to Assess the Activity of Nexrutine® in Prostate Cancer Patients
The purpose of the study is to (1) to determine the rate of PSA decline (the number declining). Tissue will be obtained for ancillary studies and (2) to determine the number of patients with a PSA decline to \<1.0 ng/ml at 3 months in patients receiving Nexrutine® with standard radiation therapy. The Secondary Objective is to confirm the tolerability of this regimen. The Third Objective (Ancillary studies) is To evaluate the molecular response of Nexrutine®. Molecular response is defined as changes in the molecular pathways.
