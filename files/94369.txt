Durvalumab and Lenvatinib in Participants With Advanced and Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with lenvatinib in participants with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma.The primary hypothesis of this study are that patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma could benefit from durvalumab plus lenvatinib with respect to: 1)Progression Free Survival (PFS) ; 2) Objective Response Rate (ORR); and Overall survival (OS). The investigators design a clinical study to explore whether the combination above as a treatment in patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma could prolong PFS and to analyze potential immune biomarker of therapeutic response.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib Oral Product
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as time from randomisation to first progression by investigator assessment using modified RECIST 1.1 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), Up to 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline who have confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the Investigator at local site, Up to 3 years
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause, Up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy can be determined., Up to 1 years
The combination of Lenvatinib and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great potential in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. This trial is designed as a prospective, open label study for 20 patients with advanced (recurrent, refractory or metastatic) endometrial cancer, including carcinosarcoma of the uterus. The aim is to investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.
