Envafolimab, Lenvatinib Combined With TACE in the Treatment of Unresectable Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
TACE lays a theoretical foundation for synergistic enhancement in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppressive agents by reducing tumor burden and peripheral blood treg, improving the immune status of patients, reducing immune tolerance, and enhancing anti-tumor effects. TACE then causes locally treated tumor cell death and releases tumor-specific antigens, which further induce tumor-associated antigen-specific responses due to this immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby activating the immune system to attack tumor cells.

This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Envafolimab, Lenvatinib combined with TACE in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Objective Response Rate (ORR)
DRUG: Envafolimab, Lenvatinib Combined With TACE
Objective response rate, Refers to the proportion of patients who achieve a pre-specified reduction in tumor size and maintain the minimum time limit, 36 month
Overall survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause (for subjects who were lost to follow-up prior to death, the time of last follow-up was generally calculated as the time of death), up to 36 month|Progression Free Survival, Time to first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause at randomization, up to 12 month|Adverse Events, Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment, up to 36 month
