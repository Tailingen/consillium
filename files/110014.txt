Trial of Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and Sorafenib in Chemotherapy-naive Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Bladder Carcinoma
This is a Phase II, nonrandomized multicenter study designed to evaluate time to progression and response proportion of patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of bladder receiving 6 cycles of gemcitabine, carboplatin and sorafenib and then maintenance sorafenib.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved progression free survival (PFS) of five months. PFS was defined as time to progression or any-cause mortality, whichever came first., Upon completion of study
Dose Ruction (Toxicity), To determine the toxicity of combination therapy with sorafenib, gemcitabine and carboplatin, dose reductions by drug are reported. The number of patients that were reduced in dosage are reported here., Upon completion of study|Best Reported Response, The best reported response captures the proportion of patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder that achieve a complete or partial response to the combination therapy with sorafenib, gemcitabine, and carboplatin., Upon completion of study
