Treatment With Darolutamide +/- Radiation Therapy for Patients With a Castration Resistant Cancer and Metastases Detected by Functional Imaging
In earlier stages of prostate cancer, male sexual hormones (androgens) stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) means that the prostate cancer continued to grow despite patients are taking hormone therapy to control the disease. One of the standard treatments for these patients is so-called 'new generation' hormonal therapy. These hormone therapies include apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide. They work by blocking androgen receptors that play an important role in the growth of prostate cancer.

In the case of oligometastatic CRPC, the cancer has gone beyond the prostate and has spread to other organs in the body (metastases), but these metastases remain limited in number.

An early detection of the oligometastatic CRPC and appropriate treatment may prolong survival in these patients.

The treatment proposed as part of this research is a combination of oral darolutamide, approved in Europe to treat patients with CRPC who do not have metastasis visible on CT-scan or bone scintigraphy (but visible with positron emission tomography-scan (PET-Scan), a more precise imaging technique) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), a new radiotherapy technique guided by very high precision medical imaging. This method makes it possible to better target cancer cells while preserving neighboring healthy organs.

The principal objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of SBRT with darolutamide, compared to darolutamide.

Radiographic Progression-free survival (rPFS), The radiographic Progression-free survival is defined as the time interval between the randomisation and radiographic disease progression with conventional imaging (CT-scan or bone-scan), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 5 years.
Time to treatment failure (TTF), The time to treatment failure is defined as the time interval between randomisation and the discontinuation of darolutamide, irrespective of the reason for discontinuation., From randomization to discontinuation of darolutamide, up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years.|Prostate cancer-specific survival, The prostate cancer-specific survival is defined as the time interval between randomisation and the date of death due to prostate cancer., From randomization to death due to prostate cancer, up to 5 years.|Time to PSA progression, The time to PSA progression is defined as the time interval between the date of randomisation and the date of PSA progression. PSA progression is defined, in accordance with the PCWG3 guidelines which retained the PCWG2 definition (2007 guidelines)., From randomization to PSA progression, up to 5 years.|Biochemical response rate, The biochemical response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a decrease in PSA levels of ≥50% from baseline levels., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years.|Time to next symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), The time to next symptomatic skeletal event is defined as the time interval from randomisation until the first occurrence of a symptomatic fracture, bone radiation (for pain or neurological complication), bone surgery (for pain or neurological complication), or spinal cord compression., Time from randomization to the first symptomatic skeletal event, up to 5 years.|Time to pain progression, The time to pain progression is defined as the time interval from randomisation until the first occurrence of any of the following:

* Increase of ≥2 points, from baseline, in question 3 of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire (item related to the worst pain in the last 24 hours).
* Initiation of opioid treatment for cancer pain.
* Increase in the use of opioid treatment of ≥30% in terms of frequency of use or cumulative dose., Time from randomization to the first occurence of pain progression, up to 5 years.|Safety/tolerance, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years.|Functional Assessment of CAncer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), The FACT-P is a self-assessment questionnaire to estimate the health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer. This questionnaire, composed of 39 items consists of four subscales: Physical Well-Being (7 items), Social/Family Well-Being (7 items), Emotional Well-Being (6 items), Functional Well-Being (7 items), and prostate cancer subscale (12 items). Subscales are rated on 5-point Likert-type scale (from 0 = "Not at all" to 4 = "Very much"). For all subscales, a higher score represents better quality of life., At baseline, 1 month, every 4 months during treatment period, and at the end of treatment (up to 5 years).|Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BP-SFI) questionnaire, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. This self-report questionnaire includes:

* A body schema
* The maximum pain, lowest pain, usual pain within the last 15 days (Numeric rating scales (NRS) 0 to 10)
* Description of current analgesic treatment,
* An assessment of relief by a percentage scale (0-100%), Assessment of the impact of pain on: mood, relationships with others, walking, sleep, work, happiness the joy - of living, recreation, activities in general (digital scales, rating from 0 \[normal\] to 10 \[no activity\])., At baseline, 1 month, every 4 months during treatment period, and at the end of treatment (up to 5 years).
PEACE 8 is a phase III open-label, randomised (patients are randomly assigned to treatment), international, multicentre trial, evaluating the benefit of adding SBRT to darolutamide for treating patients with oligometastatic CRPC.

Eligible patients will be randomised into either an experimental group receiving darolutamide + SBRT or a control group receiving darolutamide. In both arms, all patients will receive continuous castration (ADT) during the trial course.

Patients' participation in the trial will not exceed 60 months after randomisation, including a maximum treatment duration of 60 months and follow-up up to 60 months after randomisation.

After signing the consent form, patients will enter the pre-inclusion period (before the start of treatment), during which the investigator will carried out all the tests required to assess their eligibility, including demographic data collection, tumour evaluation, and clinical and biological assessments.

Patients will receive doralutamide until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 5 years after the start of treatment.

To receive treatment, the patient will need to go to hospital, where, at each visit, the medical team will conduct medical examinations before administering the treatment to assess the patient's general state of health and tolerance to the treatment.
