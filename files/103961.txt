Erlotinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: erlotinib hydrochloride
Response rate
Progression-free survival|Overall survival|Efficacy of erlotinib in inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling|Efficacy of tumor EGFR amplification in predicting response to treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme treated with erlotinib.
* Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients will be accrued for this study.
