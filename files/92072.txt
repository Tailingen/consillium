Development of an Imaging Prediction Model for Pelvic Lymph Node Metastasis of Cervical Cancer Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques.
This study is a retrospective exploratory trial conducted at a single center, aiming to develop and validate a preoperative lymphatic metastasis model for cervical cancer using artificial intelligence deep learning. The model is trained using preoperative imaging and postoperative pathological findings of cervical cancer patients, with the goal of enhancing the accuracy of lymphatic metastasis prediction through preoperative imaging and offering insights for treatment decisions.

A model for identifying pelvic lymph node metastases on preoperative imaging, Artificial intelligence (AI) technology was utilized to develop a model for identifying pelvic lymph node metastasis from preoperative images in order to enhance the accuracy of preoperative lymph node metastasis detection in cervical cancer. The model was validated with the main diagnostic focus on determining the status of lymph node metastasis., From enrollment to the end of development of model at 24 months
