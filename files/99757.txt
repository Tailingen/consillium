Collecting Blood Samples From Patients With and Without Cancer to Evaluate Tests for Early Cancer Detection
This study collects blood and tissue samples from patients with cancer and without cancer to evaluate tests for early cancer detection. Collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue from patients with and without cancer to study in the laboratory may help researchers develop tests for the early detection of cancers.

OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
Provision of blinded reference set of cancer versus non-cancer blood samples, Diagnostic ability will be assessed across the entire cohort of 2000 subjects by estimating the sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals., Up to 1 year
Test performance at the time of initial cancer diagnosis by tumor type, Diagnostic ability is assessed within each cancer type and within each cancer type and stage combination by estimating the sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. The width of these confidence intervals will vary by sample size and the sensitivity and specificity rates., Up to 1 year|Test performance at the time of initial cancer diagnosis by clinical stage, Diagnostic ability is assessed within each cancer stage and within each cancer type and stage combination by estimating the sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. The width of these confidence intervals will vary by sample size and the sensitivity and specificity rates., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To provide a blinded reference set of cancer versus (vs.) non-cancer blood samples that will be used to validate assays for inclusion in a prospective clinical trial focused on utility of blood-based multi-cancer early detection.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate test performance at the time of initial cancer diagnosis by tumor type.

II. Evaluate test performance at the time of initial cancer diagnosis by clinical stage.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete a questionnaire at baseline. Participants undergo collection of blood samples at registration and at 12 months after registration. Patients with a cancer diagnosis may undergo collection of tissue samples at registration and 12 months after registration.

After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 year.
