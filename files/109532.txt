CLDN18.2 Targeting Nanobody Probe for PET Imaging in Solid Tumors
The objective of the study is to construct a noninvasive approach 68Ga-ACN376 PET/CT to detect the CLDN18.2 expression of tumor lesions in patients with Solid tumors and to identify patients benefiting from CLDN18.2 targeting treatment.

DRUG: 18F-FDG
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, SUV is a semi-quantitative analysis index to describe the radioactive uptake of lesions, which has certain reference value for differentiating benign and malignant lesions。 The uptake of the tracer （68Ga-ACN376） in solid tumor lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 2 years
