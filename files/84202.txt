Open-label, Phase II study of Stomatitis prevention with a steroid-based mouthwash in Post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dexamethasone based mouthwash|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Exemestane
Number of Participants With Stomatitis Grade ≥ 2, The incidence of grade ≥ 2 stomatitis was reported. Grade 1 = minimal symptoms, normal diet; grade 2 = symptomatic, but able to swallow a modified diet; grade 3 = symptomatic and unable to aliment or hydrate orally; and grade 4 = symptoms associated with life-threatening consequences., 56 days

Grade 1 = minimal symptoms, normal diet; grade 2 = symptomatic, but able to swallow a modified diet; grade 3 = symptomatic and unable to aliment or hydrate orally; and grade 4 = symptoms associated with life-threatening consequences., 56 days|Median Number of Mouthwashes Per Day, The median number of mouthwashes per day was assessed., 56 days|Number of Participants With All Grades of Stomatitis, The number of participants with all grades of stomatitis was defined as the number of participants who had stomatitis grade 1 or higher. Grade 1 = minimal symptoms, normal diet; grade 2 = symptomatic, but able to swallow a modified diet; grade 3 = symptomatic and unable to aliment or hydrate orally; and grade 4 = symptoms associated with life-threatening consequences., 56 days|Dose Intensity of Everolimus and Exemestane, The dose intensity was calculated as the cumulative dose of everolimus or exemestane divided by the length of time on treatment during the first 56 days of treatment., 56 days|Blood Concentration of Everolimus and Exemestane, Blood samples were collected and analyzed., 28 days (pre-dose)
