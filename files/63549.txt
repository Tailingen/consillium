Acceptability of 3D Printed Breast Models as Surgical Decision Aids for Breast Cancer Treatment
This study is to find out the acceptability of a 3D printed breast model by patients as they consider their surgical treatment options. Researchers also want to learn the possible impact of the 3D printed breast model in the patient's decision making process.

OTHER: Decision Aid|PROCEDURE: Discussion|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Change in patient decisional conflict, Will be assessed based on changes in decisional conflict scale data collected before and after use of the 3 dimensional (3D) printed breast model during consultation with the breast surgeon using paired sample t-tests., 45 minutes - up to 12 months|Acceptability of the 3D model, Will be measured with questions adapted from the Ottawa measures. 'Acceptability' (of a decision aid) refers to ratings regarding the comprehensibility of components of a decision aid, its length, pace (if audio-visual), amount of information, balance in presentation of information about options, and overall suitability for decision making. Responses are reported descriptively in terms of the proportions of patients responding positively or negatively on each criterion., 45 minutes - up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine feasibility and explore the acceptability of 3 dimensional (3D) printed breast models as a decision aid in breast cancer treatment decision making.

OUTLINE:

Patients complete questionnaire over 5 minutes about difficulties in making decision about breast cancer treatment, then participate in a consultation with regular care doctor and study doctor/study staff using the 3D breast model. Patients then complete questionnaires over 5-10 minutes about their opinions on the breast model and different breast surgical treatment options available.
