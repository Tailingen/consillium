Mobile Application to Improve Health-Related Outcomes in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer
Multi-site randomized trial of the THRIVE digital health application versus usual care to evaluate the effect of THRIVE on quality of life (QOL), physical and psychological symptoms, coping, and self-efficacy in 250 patients with newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer.

Multi-site randomized controlled trial of the THRIVE digital health application versus usual care in 250 patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer within the previous 12 weeks to examine the effect of the intervention on patient-reported QOL, physical symptoms, anxiety and depression symptoms, coping, and self-efficacy. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and stratified by study site and lung cancer type to ensure a balanced representation of these factors between the two study groups. The study team will provide iPads to patients assigned to THRIVE and provide instructions on how to use the iPad and digital app. The study team will administer patient-reported outcome measures at enrollment and again at six, 12, and 24 weeks post-enrollment to evaluate the short and long-term impact of THRIVE.
