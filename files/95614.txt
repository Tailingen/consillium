Trial of Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine OSE2101 in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Secondary Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor
Multicenter, randomized (2:1), open-label phase 3 study in HLA-A2 positive patients with squamous and non-squamous metastatic NSCLC with ICI secondary resistance.

Patients will be randomized into 2 arms (randomization 2:1): experimental Arm A with OSE2101 monotherapy or control Arm B SoC with docetaxel monotherapy. Stratification factors will be histology (squamous versus non squamous) and ECOG Performance Status (0 versus 1).
