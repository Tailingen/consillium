A Study of ARQ 197 in Combination With Erlotinib
This is a phase I study to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dose of ARQ 197 given in combination with erlotinib as primary endpoints in CYP2C19 poor metabolizer patients with advanced/recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. The pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of ARQ 197 administered alone or in combination with erlotinib will also be determined as secondary endpoints.
Advanced/Recurrent Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ARQ 197 and Erlotinib
Dose-Limiting Toxicity in the combination of tivantinib and erlotinib, Tivantinib was treated once as a single agent on Day 1. After 2 days of interruption, dayly treatments of the combination started., DLT observation period started from the day of first single agent treatment to the day after the continuous combination treatment for 29 days.
