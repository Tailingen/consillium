CMAB009 Combined With FOLFIRI First-line Treatment in Patients With RAS/BRAF Wild-type, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Drugs used against cancer work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as CMAB009, can block tumor growth in different ways. Giving combination chemotherapy together with CMAB009 as first treatment after diagnosis of a metastatic colorectal cancer（first-line treatment）may improve the treatment efficacy. However, it is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with CMAB009 is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone. This open-label trial investigates the effectiveness of CMAB009 in combination with a standard and effective chemotherapy FOLFIRI（5-Fluorouracil /Folinic acid plus Irinotecan）for RAS/BRAF wild-type, metastatic colorectal cancer in first-line setting, compared to the same chemotherapy alone.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CMAB009|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Folinic acid|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The PFS duration (in months) is determined by a specially authorized Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRaC) through blinded review of imaging data. It is defined as the time from randomization to the first confirmed progression of disease by imaging or death from any cause within 90 days after the last tumor assessment or randomization, whichever is later (equivalent to 1.5 times the interval between two consecutive tumor assessments)., Tumor assessments are conducted every 8 weeks after randomization until the end of the study, an average of 1 year.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate is calculated as the percentage of evaluable subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) (ORR = CR + PR)., Tumor assessments are conducted every 8 weeks after randomization until the end of the study, an average of 1 year.|Overall Survival（OS）, Defined as the time from randomization to death (in months). For subjects still alive or lost to follow-up as of the data analysis cutoff date, survival is censored at the subject's last known alive time., From randomization until the end of the study, an average of 1 year.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Refers to the percentage of subjects with the best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (DCR = CR + PR + SD)., Tumor assessments are conducted every 8 weeks after randomization until the end of the study, an average of 1 year.|Time to Response (TTR), For subjects with the best response of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, the time from randomization to the first occurrence of response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1., Tumor assessments are conducted every 8 weeks after randomization until the end of the study, an average of 1 year.|Quality of Life Assessment Indicators, Quality of life assessment (QOL) is conducted using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, with individual item categorical scores linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale., Assessments are conducted at baseline and subsequent visits every 8 weeks until withdrawal from the study and entry into the follow-up period.|Resection Rate of Hepatic Metastasis, The resection rate of hepatic metastasis is calculated as the number of subjects achieving complete resection (R0 resection) divided by the total number of subjects., From randomization to the end of study|Safety Endpoint, Drug exposure, All types of AEs and incidence rates, Mortality rate and causes of death, Safety laboratory tests, Vital signs and Immunogenicity., From enrollment to the end of study
Patients will be randomly assign in one of the two groups to either receive the combination chemotherapy alone or with CMAB009 and will then be treated until progression of the disease or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Regular efficacy assessments（every 8 weeks）based on imaging will be performed throughout the study together with regular safety assessments.

After participant discontinuation from the trial, regular updates on further treatments and survival status will be requested from the investigator.
