Cognition in Older Breast Cancer Survivors: Treatment Exposure, APOE and Smoking History
In this study,the investigators are looking to see how older women who are survivors of breast cancer and either did or did not receive chemotherapy are affected by treatment, compared to older women who have never had cancer. Thinking and memory abilities normally decrease with age and the investigators want to see if the long-term effects of cancer treatments may make these problems worse. The investigators will also look at how thinking and memory abilities of older women are affected by genetics and smoking history. Genetics and other factors may affect the brain's chemicals or structure, and may either protect against the negative effects on thinking or make someone more at risk for them.

MSK participants who previously consented to allostatic blood and saliva collection but have not yet provided any allostatic blood or saliva samples for this study, will not be asked to provide any further samples at follow-up. Participants who have consented to allostatic sample collection and provided one set of allostatic blood and saliva samples at a previous follow-up study visit will still be asked to provide a second set of samples at a later follow-up. COH participants will continue to provide allostatic blood and saliva collection as originally outlined
