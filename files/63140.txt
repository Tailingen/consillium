Curcumin in Combination With 5FU for Colon Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find the response rate of combining the dietary supplement, curcumin, with the standard of care, FDA-approved chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU, Adracil) and see what effects (good and bad) that the combined treatments have on colon cancer.
Metastatic Colon Cancer
DRUG: Curcumin|DRUG: 5-flurorouracil
Determine the safety using curcumin in patients with metastatic colon cancer; where toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0., Events will be recorded from the time of informed consent signature through the 30 days following the last study treatment., 12 weeks
Overall Response, Recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. The patient's best response assignment will depend on the finding of target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions., 12 months|Evidence of altered biomarker status (circulating DNA methylation status, miRNA profile) at 8 weeks post-treatment according to RECIST version 1.1 and survival criteria., Blood will be collected at baseline, after completing one cycle of curcumin treatment (2 weeks), and after completing three 2 week-cycles of 5FU (6 weeks) for inflammatory and epigenetic chemoresponsive biomarker profiling., Baseline, Week 2, Week 8|Duration of response, 12 months|Duration of progression free survival, 12 months|Duration of overall survival, 12 months|Duration of Quality of Life, All subjects will complete the quality of life survey at Baseline, 5FU treatment visits and follow-up visits., Baseline, 12 months
Confirm clinical safety and identify clinical response rate of combination treatment with curcumin and 5FU in chemorefractory CRC patients. To determine whether curcumin administration induces systemic alterations in inflammatory and epigenetic biomarkers in patients with chemoresistant metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). To correlate altered biomarker findings with clinical response according to RECIST V1.1 and survival criteria.
