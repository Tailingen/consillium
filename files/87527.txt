TACE Plus Recombinant Human Adenovirus for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine if TACE plus Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5 Injection will improve outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to surgery or local ablative therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5 Injection|PROCEDURE: Transartery Chemoembolization
Overall survival time, 3 years
Number of adverse events, Number of adverse events, and number of patients who developed adverse event. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), 30 days|Tumor response, Tumor response based on modified RECIST, 12 weeks
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is currently one of the mainstays of palliative treatments worldwide for patients with unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC).However, the long term outcomes were generally poor for HCC patients treated with TACE. Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5, an E1B gene deleted adenovirus, is known to have a significant antitumor activity. In addition, local injection of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 can enhance the effect of antitumor therapies (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). The hypothesis is that patients with unresectable HCC may benefit from recombinant human adenovirus type 5 in combination with TACE.
