Single Fraction Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation vs. Five Fraction Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation for Low-risk Stage 0 and I Breast Carcinoma
This study will evaluate the local control, complication rates, cosmetic results, and quality of life between patients treated with a single fraction vs. five fractions of accelerated partial breast irradiation (S_APBI vs. F_APBI) when used as the sole method of radiation therapy.

Proportion of patients who are free of breast cancer in the treated breast (IBTR), -IBTRs will be categorized as local (infield) if they occur within the prescription isodose volume, peripheral if between the prescription isodose volume and a volume 2 cm outside of the prescription isodose volume, and non-contiguous or extrafield if they are beyond the peripheral volume described above., Through 5 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 years and 5 days)|Feasibility of treatment regimen as measured by the ability to complete accrual to the trial in 3 years, Through enrollment of all participants (estimated to be 3 years)
Proportion of patients who are free of breast cancer in the regional lymph nodes, -Regional lymph nodes are ipsilateral axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and internal mammary groups., Through 5 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 years and 5 days)|Proportion of patients who are free of distant disease, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 years and 5 days)|Proportion of patients who are alive, Through 5 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 years and 5 days)|Change in quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, * The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.
* All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Baseline, 6 months post-end of radiation therapy (RT), 12 months post-end of RT, 24 months post-end of RT, 36 months post-end of RT, 4 years post-end of RT, and 5 years post-end of RT|Change in quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-BR23, * The QLQ-BR23 is a breast-specific module that comprises of 23 questions to assess body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective, systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms and upset by hair loss.
* All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Baseline, 6 months post-end of radiation therapy (RT), 12 months post-end of RT, 24 months post-end of RT, 36 months post-end of RT, 4 years post-end of RT, and 5 years post-end of RT|Change in cosmesis as measured quantitatively by the Breast Retraction Assessment (BRA), -Breast Retraction Assessment (BRA) is an objective evaluation of the amount of cosmetic retraction of the treated breast in comparison to the untreated breast in patients. A clear acrylic sheet supported vertically and marked as a grid at 1 cm intervals is employed to perform the measurements., Before treatment, 4-8 month follow-up, 10-14 month follow-up, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years (estimated to be 5 years)|Change in cosmesis as measured quantitatively by the Percent Breast Retraction Assessment (pBRA), -Breast Retraction Assessment (BRA) is an objective evaluation of the amount of cosmetic retraction of the treated breast in comparison to the untreated breast in patients. A clear acrylic sheet supported vertically and marked as a grid at 1 cm intervals is employed to perform the measurements., Before treatment, 4-8 month follow-up, 10-14 month follow-up, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years (estimated to be 5 years|Change in cosmesis as measured qualitatively by the Aronson modified Harris scale (physician graded), -The following general descriptors will be used:

* Excellent - when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no difference in the size, shape, or texture of the treated breast. There may be mild thickening or scar tissue within the breast or skin, but not enough to change the appearance.
* Good - there is mild asymmetry in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the normal breast. The thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.
* Fair - there is obvious difference in the size and shape of the treated breast. This change involves ¼ or less of the breast.
* Poor - marked change in the appearance of the treated breast involving more than ¼ of the breast tissue., Before treatment, 4-8 month follow-up, 10-14 month follow-up, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years (estimated to be 5 years|Change in cosmesis as measured qualitatively by the Aronson modified Harris scale (patient graded), -The following general descriptors will be used:

* Toxicities of concern include breast pain, delayed wound healing, persistent seroma fluid accumulation, breast fibrosis, and fat necrosis in the treated breast. Rare toxicities include radiation pneumonitis, coronary artery disease, and pericarditis., From start of treatment until 6 months post-treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Proportion of patients who are free of late serious treatment related toxicity, * Serious treatment related toxicity are those treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events as measured by CTCAE v5.0
* Toxicities of concern include breast pain, delayed wound healing, persistent seroma fluid accumulation, breast fibrosis, and fat necrosis in the treated breast. Rare toxicities include radiation pneumonitis, coronary artery disease, and pericarditis., From 6 months through 5 years (estimated to be 4.5 years)
