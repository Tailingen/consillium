The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability including determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study will also look at pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of AO-252 as a monotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), high- grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), and endometrial cancer
