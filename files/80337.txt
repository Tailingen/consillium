Selinexor in Patients With Advanced Thymic Epithelial Tumor Progressing After Primary Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of selinexor in patients with advanced thymic epithelial tumor progressing after primary chemotherapy. This is a multicenter, open label phase II trial that uses a Simons two stage design. The study population is adults with histologically confirmed, advanced, inoperable TETs who are progressing after treatment with at least one platinum containing chemotherapy regimen.

This study is comprised of 2 similar phase II trials, one running in US (25 patients) and one running in EU (25 patients):

There are two study arms:

Arm A: Thymoma

* Stage 1: 15 patients
* Stage 2: 10 patients

Arm B: Thymic carcinoma

* Stage 1: 15 patients
* Stage 2: 10 patients
Thymoma|Advanced Thymic Epithelial Tumor
DRUG: Open Label Selinexor
Overall Response Rate, To determine the overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR+ PR., 24 months
Overall Response Rate, To determine the overall response rate to according to modified ITMIG response criteria. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT and MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 24 months|6 Month Progression Free Survival Rate, To determine six months progression free survival of patients with TET treated with selinexor, 6 months|24 Month Overall Survival Rate, To determine overall survival of patients with TET treated with selinexor, 24 months|Adverse Events, The number of adverse events as determined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs) version 4.03, 24 months
