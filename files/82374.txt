Local Excision of Clinical T3 Rectal Adenocarcinoma Showing Major Response(ycT0-1) After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
The purpose of this study is evaluation of the safety and the efficacy of transanal local excision in patients with cT3 rectal cancer which was downstaged into ycT0-1 after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Local excision
3-year disease free survival, Death or recurrence as an event, 1-5 years
Complete response rate, The rate of complete response of the tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 1-5 years|Overall survival rate, Death as an event, 1-5 years
This study is a prospective multicenter single-arm phase II clinical trial. Rectal cancer patients with cT3 stage will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and be evaluated the response of the tumor in 6 to 10 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. For those who have good response (ycT0-1) will underwent transanal local excision under the patients' agree.
