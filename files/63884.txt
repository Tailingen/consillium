Radiogenomic and Prognosis Analysis in Glioma
This study aims to evaluate whether MRI can be used to predict genomics and prognosis in glioma. Given the profound prognostic significance of genetic mutations seen in glioma, there have been increasing attempts to correlate imaging characteristics with genetic, mutational and expression patterns. To be able to predict genomics and prognosis based on imaging alone will prove useful in patients with involvement of glioma in delicate areas of the brain and better reflect tumor and molecular heterogeneity.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI
Time to progression, The response was determined by a modification of the response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria that combined the image assessment, neurologic evaluation and assessment of steroid use., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Genomics including IDH mutation, 1p19q codeletion, MGMT methylation and EGFR mutation status, Proportion of positive IDH mutation, 1p19q codeletion, MGMT methylation and EGFR mutation in percentage (%), 2 months|Progression free survival, Estimated probable duration of life without disease progression, from on-study date to earlier progression date or date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring. The response was determined by a modification of the RANO criteria that combined the image assessment, neurologic evaluation and assessment of steroid use., Through study completion, an average of 3 years
Previous studies have proposed certain imaging characteristics correlating with genetic, molecular and expression patterns. Advanced imaging provides additional clues but no studies have examined its added value particularly in a prospective setting. The investigator's aim to evaluate preoperative MRI for patients suspected of glioma to predict IDH mutation, 1p19q codeletion, MGMT methylation and EGFR mutation status using imaging characteristics such as margin, patterns of contrast enhancement and edema as well as diffusion and perfusion characteristics. This will be confirmed pathologically and further correlated with patients' long term outcome.
