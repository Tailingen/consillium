Study to Describe the Real-world Treatment Patterns and Associated Outcomes in Patients With HER2-positive Unresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This multicountry, multicenter, retrospective, non-interventional study involving patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer mBC will be conducted to understand the demographic and clinico-pathological profile of the patients, diagnostic practices for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, current treatment landscape and sequencing of therapies, associated burden of toxicities with all lines of treatment (LOTs), and survival outcomes in the real-world setting.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
OTHER: None (Observational study)
Percentage of patients receiving each treatment regimen with or without hormonal therapy in each LOT, Assessment of treatment patterns in patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC. Line of treatment (LOT) is defined as one regimen, possibly a combination of several drugs, given from either the index diagnosis or disease progression until the treatment fails to control the disease, is not tolerated by the patient, the disease relapses/progresses, or death occurs., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Duration of therapy (DoT) for each regimen in each LOT, Assessment of length of time from initiation of therapy to permanent discontinuation. The DoT will be calculated as the time from the date of initiation of LOT to the stop of the treatment regimen for every LOT as per dates available in the medical record., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Percentage of patients receiving local and regional treatment for metastasis, Assessment of local and regional treatment for metastasis (radiotherapy and/or surgery), and bone protection therapy, Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]
Demographic and clinico-pathological characteristics of patients with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC, Descriptive statistics will be used to describe socio-demographic and clinico-pathological characteristics for the overall study., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Real-world disease progression, Real-world disease progression of unresectable or mBC is defined as that documented in either the radiology report, pathology reports or clinician note as cancer progression., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Real-world progression free survival (rwPFS), Real-world PFS is defined as the time from date of initiation of LOT to documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Occurrence and date of disease progression in rwPFS will be determined from documentation within the patient record, such as pathology reports, imaging report notes, and statements about disease progression in the oncologist progress notes. Patients without an event (progression/death) will be censored at last date of assessment., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Overall survival, Length of time from the date of diagnosis of unresectable or mBC or date of initiation of LOT to death due to any cause. If patient is not dead until the last record available or date of data extraction, then time-to-event will be calculated for that date. Patients who are known to be alive at the date of data collection will be censored at the date of data collection. Patients who are lost to follow up will be censored on the date they were last known to be alive (eg. date of last recorded hospital visit)., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Real-world objective response rate, The percentage of patients who have achieved real-world partial response (rwPR) and real-world complete response (rwCR) to therapy for each LOT., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Real-world disease control rate, The percentage of patients with rwCR, rwPR and real-world stable disease (rwSD) during treatment for each LOT, Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]|Percentage of Proportion of patients with AESIs that led to treatment discontinuations, hospitalisatons and deaths., Assessment of safety and tolerability of different treatment regimens in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC., Retrospective: from date of first diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (01 January 2017) to the end of follow-up (i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest) [Approximately 12 Months]
The study will involve patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or mBC since the earlier date between the date of trastuzumab emtansine (\[T-DM1\] Kadcyla) becoming available through reimbursement or patient access programme as a valid local treatment option or 01 January 2017 and who received at least 1 LOT. The data will be collected from the date of diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (index date) to the end of follow-up (ie, until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is earlier). The study will not have any study-specific patient visits or a longitudinal follow-up. All available data will be extracted from patients' medical records or obtained from patients themselves after obtaining an informed consent unless a waiver is granted by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)/Ethics Committee (EC). The informed consent may be obtained at the time of patients routine clinical care visit to the oncology centre. The data on different types of treatment received by the patients, socio-demographics, and clinico-pathological characteristics will be extracted from patients medical records up to the date informed consent was obtained.

This study will be conducted in non-US and non-European countries including Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. The total number of patients in the study will be approximately a minimum of 570 and a maximum of 830 patients. The study will be implemented at approximately 50 to 100 oncology centres spanning across 6 countries in the AstraZeneca (AZ) International Region (ie, non-US, non-European countries).
