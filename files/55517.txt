Pre-emptive Therapy With DEC-C to Improve Outcomes in MDS Patients With Measurable Residual Disease Post Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
The investigators hypothesize that early measurable residual disease (MRD)-guided pre-emptive therapy with decitabine + cedazaridine (DEC-C) will decrease the risk of progression in post-transplant myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with persistent mutations (molecular MRD). To detect molecular MRD, the investigators will perform ultra-deep, error-corrected panel-based sequencing (MyeloSeq-HD) at Day 30 in post-transplant MDS patients. The investigators will treat patients with detectable molecular MRD with DEC-C to determine if pre-emptive, MRD-guided therapy with DEC-C decreases relapse rates and improves progression-free survival.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: DEC-C|DEVICE: MyeloSeq-HD
Number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (Phase I only), -Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as any of the following adverse events that occur during the DLT observation period (Cycle 1) during the phase I portion of the study, determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug:

* Grade 4 neutropenia or grade 4 thrombocytopenia in the absence of increased blasts and/or evidence of persistent MDS at the end of Cycle 1.
* Any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity except for grade 3 vomiting or diarrhea not requiring tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, or requiring or prolonging hospitalization, or grade 3 or 4 isolated electrolyte abnormalities that last \<72 hours.
* Any other non-hematologic toxicity that is clinically significant and/or unacceptable that does not respond to supportive care, results in disruption of dosing schedule more than 28 days, or is judged to be a DLT by the Investigator.
* Confirmed Hy's law cases will be considered a DLT, Completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for all phase I participants (estimated to be 13 months)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (Phase I only), -The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which â‰¥ 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle., Completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for all phase I participants (estimated to be 13 months)|Recommended phase II dose (Phase I only), -The recommended phase II dose will be less than or equal to the maximum tolerated dose, Completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for all phase I participants (estimated to be 13 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS) (Phase II recommended dose only), -Progression-free survival: Defined as the interval from the date of transplant to disease progression or death, whichever is first., 1 year post-transplant|Rate of relapse (Phase II recommended dose only), -Disease progression/relapse post-transplant is defined as \>5% myeloblasts in the bone marrow, evidence of extramedullary disease, reemergence of pre-transplant cytogenetic abnormalities, or intervention by the treating physician (such as withdrawal of immunosuppression) for reemergence of pre-transplantation morphologic abnormalities that are likely relapsed disease in the opinion of the treating physician., 1 year post-transplant
Overall survival (OS), -Overall survival: Defined as the date of transplant to the date of death from any cause., 1 year post-transplant|Percentage of patients requiring DEC-C dose adjustment/delay, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 168 days)|Percentage of cycles given on time/at dose, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 168 days)|Change in mutational MRD disease burden as measured by variant allele frequency (VAF) cycles, -In patients who have at least 1 cycle of treatment, Day 180
