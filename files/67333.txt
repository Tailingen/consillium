Oral Thalidomide and Tegafur-uracil to Decrease Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence
This single-centered phase II clinical study is to obtain preliminary information on 1-year recurrence-free survival rate, recurrence-free survival and safety profile of thalidomide in combination with tegafur-uracil in hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy and explore biomarkers(VEGF/bFGF) for thalidomide response.

tumor recurrence, Measure a-fetoprotein and perform liver echo to find out tumor recurrence every 3 month. Then, if a tumor/tumors are found in liver echo, tumor recurrence will be confirmed by CT scan. The imaging on CT shows typical HCC pattern.

The pilot study is to obtain preliminary information on:

* 3-year recurrence-free survival rate
* Recurrence-free survival
* Safety profile of the treatment
* Biomarkers response(VEGF/bFGF), every 3 months, up to 5 years
After liver resection to remove the hepatocellular carcinioma completely, the patients with high risk of tumor recurrence will be enrolled into this study. The high risk of tumor recurrence depends on tumor characteristics. The risk factors of tumor characteristics included tumor size \>5 cm in diameter, abscence of encapsulation, vascular invasion and presence of daughter nodules. The patients with high risk of tumor recurrence will have 1 to 3 risk factors. When the patients are enrolled into the study, oral thalidomide in combination with tegafur-uracil will be applied to prevent tumor recurrence. The patients will be fillowed uo erevy 3 mnoths.
