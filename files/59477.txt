Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TT-00420 (Tinengotinib) in Cholangiocarcinoma
This study is an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TT-00420 tablet in adult patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma|FGFR2 Fusion|FGFR2 Gene Mutation|FGFR1 Alteration|FGFR3 Alteration
DRUG: TT-00420
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in patients with FGFR2 fusions who have failed at least one previous treatment with an FGFR inhibitor (Cohort A1), The proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|ORR in patients with FGFR2 fusions who have responded (CR or PR) on at least one previous treatment with an FGFR inhibitor and discontinued due to progressive disease (Cohort A2), Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|ORR in patients with FGFR alterations other than FGFR2 fusions (Cohort B), Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|ORR in patients without FGFR alterations (wild-type FGFR mutation status) (Cohort C), Through study completion, an average of 9 months.
ORR in all patients with FGFR alterations (Cohorts A and B), Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (All Cohorts), From first study drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) (All Cohorts), Defined as CR + PR + stable disease (SD), Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Overall Survival (OS) (All Cohorts), From first study drug administration until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months|Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment (All Cohorts), As assessed per CTCAE version 5.0, Up to 30 days from study discontinuation|Concentration of TT-00420 at Protocol-Specified Timepoints (All Cohorts), From Cycle 1 to Cycle 4, an average of 4 months (each cycle is 28 days)
Genetic Alteration Status, Evaluation of biomarkers, including but not limited to, FGFR mutation status, Through study completion, an average of 9 months
This is a Phase II, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TT00420 in patients with advanced/metastatic and surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with 1) FGFR 2 fusions who failed prior FGFR inhibitor treatment, 2) FGFR2 fusions who responded on prior FGFR inhibitor treatment, 3) with other FGFR alterations, or 4) whose tumors do not contain a detectable FGFR alteration.
