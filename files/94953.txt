Molecular Analysis of Thrombocytopenia and Cancer (MATAC): Investigating Antigenic Mimicry Between Platelets and Tumor Cells in Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) Associated With Cancer
The association between hematologic malignancies and ITP is well described, but this link is much less clear with solid cancers. In cases of ITP associated with cancers, specific cancer treatment can lead to remission or even cure of ITP. Thus, our hypothesis was that chronic expression of GPIIB by tumor cells could have initiated an autoimmune loop against GPIIB, leading to the onset and perpetuation of ITP.

Autoimmune thrombocytopenia, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by platelet destruction and impaired production, posing a life-threatening risk due to bleeding complications. The pathophysiology of ITP involves complex mechanisms, including both defective platelet production and auto-reactivity of B and T lymphocytes leading to the production of autoantibodies against platelets, found in 35 to 55% of cases. Additionally, in the context of neoplasia, some patients may develop varying degrees of thrombocytopenia, exacerbating morbidity and mortality. A multicenter, retrospective study will collect data from routine care, including birth date, gender, biological parameters related to ITP, dates of treatment initiation and diagnosis of ITP and cancer, types of treatments, and outcomes such as survival or death, without additional medical interventions or appointments.
