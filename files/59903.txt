A Study of AC682 for the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic ER+ Breast Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC682 in participants with estrogen receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to:

* Identify the recommended dose of AC682 that can be given safely to participants
* To evaluate the side effects of AC682
* To evaluate pharmacokinetics of AC682
* To evaluate the effectiveness of AC682
Breast Cancer
DRUG: AC682
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 28 days (Cycle 1)|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and clinically significant grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities following administration of AC682, Adverse events will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0., Through study completion, approximately 18 months
Objective response rate (ORR) as a measure of anti-tumor activity, Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) as a measure of anti-tumor activity, Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Duration of response (DOR) as a measure of anti-tumor activity, Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Disease control rate (DCR) as a measure of anti-tumor activity, Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Progression free survival (PFS) as a measure of anti-tumor activity, Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)), Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(0-tau)), Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), Through study completion, approximately 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Analysis: terminal elimination half life (t1/2), Through study completion, approximately 18 months
This is a Phase I, first in human, open-label dose-escalation study of AC682, an orally available estrogen receptor degrader, given as a single agent.
