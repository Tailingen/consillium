Quantitative Evaluation of the Breast's Morphological Variations During Radiotherapy: MorphoBreast3D
Quantitative evaluation of the breast's morphological variations during radiotherapy consisting in performing three-dimensional surface acquisitions of the breast in order to study its shape and volume. Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of these variations.

Impact of breast morphology or volume changes during the breast irradiation on the total dose administered, To analyse the effect of morphological changes in the breast during breast radiotherapy on the dose really administered in the remaining mammary gland after breast-conserving surgery compared to the dose initially planned., Change of the dose delivered in the breast from the baseline treatment planification at the end of the treatment (at 5 weeks for in-situ carcinoma and at 6.5 weeks for invasive carcinoma)
Preliminary quantitative assessment of breast volume changes (mL) during breast radiotherapy following breast cancer conservative surgery, At 1, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days from the start of the treatment (corresponding to the fraction number 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 33)|Preliminary quantitative assessment of breast deformations (mm) during breast radiotherapy following breast cancer conservative surgery, At 1, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days from the start of the treatment (corresponding to the fraction number 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 33)|Breast deformation and volume measurements reproducibility, Evaluation of the reproducibility of deformation and volume measurements between 2 consecutive surface scan acquisition. Reproducibility was calculated in accordance with International Organization of Standardisation (ISO 5725-2) and American Society for Testing and Material E177, before treatment start|Deviation between the breast volume calculated and the breast volume manually delineated, Evaluation of the difference between the initial breast volume calculated by the software developed for the study and the delineated volume, before treatment start|Required measurement time (surface scan), Mean time (in minutes) needed to perform a surface scan, At 1, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days from the start of the treatment (corresponding to the fraction number 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 33)|Correlation between textural data and radio-induced erythema, At 1, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days from the start of the treatment (corresponding to the fraction number 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 33)|Potential dose distribution alteration despite no variation of the 95Recalculated or the D2Recalculated, at the end of each treatment (at 5 weeks for in-situ carcinoma and at 6.5 weeks for invasive carcinoma)
