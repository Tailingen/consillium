CPAP for Esophageal Cancer With Radiotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the use of CPAP in patients with esophgaeal cancer undergoing radiotherapy.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* does use of CPAP decrease exposure of normal lung to radiation?
* does use of CPAP decrease exposure of normal heart to radiation?

Participants will undergo simulation twice:

* with CPAP
* without CPAP
