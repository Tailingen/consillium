Efficacy and Safety Study of F520 Combined With Lenvatinib in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II study on the efficacy and safety of F520 combined with lenvatinib in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. About 138\~158 patients with advanced solid tumors plan to be enrolled in about 30 study sites of the study.

Part I: Phase Ib study evaluating the safety and tolerability of F520 combined with lenvatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Part II: Phase II study of F520 combined with lenvatinib in endometrial cancer and cervical cancer.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: F520|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Serious adverse events, Phase Ib: The incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events, their correlation with the trial drug and their severity., 21 days after first dose|Adverse events, Phase Ib: The incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events, their correlation with the trial drug and their severity., 21 days after first dose|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Phase Ib: Assess the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or phase II recommended dose (RP2D)., 21 days after first dose|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Phase Ib: Assess the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or phase II recommended dose (RP2D)., 21 days after first dose|Phase II recommended dose (RP2D)., Phase Ib: Assess the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or phase II recommended dose (RP2D)., 21 days after first dose|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORRW24) evaluated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on RECIST 1.1., 24 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR), Phase Ib: To determine the preliminary efficacy by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR) of F520 combined with lenvatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors (The last subject completed the 8th cycle of administration and completed the corresponding visits)., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax）, Phase Ib: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of F520 and lenvatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors., 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose, early withdrawal or occurrence of SAE or grade ≥ 3 TRAE related to the study drug|Objective response rate (ORR), Phase II: The objective response rate evaluated by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 (ORRW24)., 24 weeks|PFS, Phase II: PFS evaluated by IRC and investigator based on RECIST., through study completion, an average of 2 year|PFS, Phase II: PFS evaluated by IRC and investigator based on iRECIST., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Adverse events, Phase II: Evaluate the number and percent of patients with adverse events/adverse reactions and serious adverse events/severe adverse reactions in selected patients with advanced solid tumors treated with F520 combined with lenvatinib., 30 days after the last dose|Adverse reactions, Phase II: Evaluate the number and percent of patients with adverse events/adverse reactions and serious adverse events/severe adverse reactions in selected patients with advanced solid tumors treated with F520 combined with lenvatinib., 30 days after the last dose|Serious adverse events, Phase II: Evaluate the number and percent of patients with adverse events/adverse reactions and serious adverse events/severe adverse reactions in selected patients with advanced solid tumors treated with F520 combined with lenvatinib., 30 days after the last dose|Severe adverse reactions, Phase II: Evaluate the number and percent of patients with adverse events/adverse reactions and serious adverse events/severe adverse reactions in selected patients with advanced solid tumors treated with F520 combined with lenvatinib., 30 days after the last dose
