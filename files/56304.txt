Maladaptive Adipose Tissue Activity in Cancer
The purpose of this pilot research is to study brown adipose tissue, a type of fat that increases metabolism (burns energy) during exposure to cold, and how it may contribute to the weight loss observed in cancer.

PROCEDURE: Resting Energy Expenditure|OTHER: Thermal Comfort Questionnaire
Difference in resting energy expenditure between brown adipose tissue (BAT)-positive and BAT-negative patients with cancer., Characterization of the energy metabolism profiles of cancer patients with and without evidence of BAT activation will be assessed utilizing one sided t-test., 27 Months
Difference in energy expenditure between room temperature and response to warm exposure (energy expenditure) in BAT-positive and BAT-negative cancer patients., Assessment of environmental modulation as an effective strategy to mitigate maladaptive BAT activation in patients with malignancy will be assessed by two-sided t-test., 27 Months
The purpose of this research is to study brown adipose tissue, a type of fat that increases metabolism (burns energy) during exposure to cold, and how it may contribute to the weight loss observed in cancer. Many patients affected by cancer lose weight, despite normal or increased nutrition. It may progress to the condition called "cancer-associated cachexia." Cancer associated cachexia is defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass with or without the loss of fat mass, and may negatively affect quality of life and the ability to undergo cancer treatments. Metabolism is the breakdown of food by the body into the energy that your body needs.
