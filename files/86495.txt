A First-in-Human Study of BG-C137, an Anti-FGFR2b Antibody Drug Conjugate, in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-C137 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: BG-C137
Phase 1a: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs as graded by the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version (NCI CTCAE 5.0)), including AEs that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria and AEs meeting protocol-defined adverse event of special interest (AESIs), Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) of BG-C137, The MTD or MAD is defined as the highest dose evaluated for which the estimated toxicity rate is closest to a target toxicity rate, or the highest dose administered, respectively., Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Recommended Dose(s) for Expansion (RDFE[s]) of BG-C137, RDFE(s) is determined based on relevant data, as available, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BG-C137, The RP2D of BG-C137 monotherapy will be determined based on relevant data, as available, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response Evaluations Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 2 years
Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR or PR, as determined by RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1a and 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of a CR, PR, and stable disease, as assessed by RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of progression or death, whichever comes first, as assessed using RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs as graded by the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version (NCI CTCAE 5.0), and AEs meeting protocol-defined adverse event of special interest (AESIs), Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Plasma concentrations of BG-C137 analytes, Up to approximately 1 year; at the end of treatment (maximum of 2 years) and at the first safety follow-up visit (30 days after last dose)|Phase 1b: Plasma concentrations of BGB-C137 analytes, Up to approximately 1 year; at the end of treatment (maximum of 2 years) and at the first safety follow-up visit (30 days after last dose)|Phase 1a: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BGB-C137 analytes, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a: Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of BGB-C137 analytes, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a: Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) Of BGB-C137 analytes, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of BGB-C137 analytes, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a: Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of BGB-C137 analytes, Twice in the first 3 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Incidence of Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs) to BGB-C137, Up to approximately 2 years
