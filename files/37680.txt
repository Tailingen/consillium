CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells for Adults With Recurrent or Refractory B Cell Malignancies
In this protocol, the investigators hypothesize that modifying the process of producing CAR+ T-cells can help to improve responses and reduce toxicities. Building on previous in vitro studies that have shown successful production of CAR+ T-cells using a new production approach, the investigators are now studying the ability to produce these CAR+ T-cells and determine how well they work in the clinical setting.
B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adult|B-cell Lymphoma Refractory|B-cell Lymphoma Recurrent
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: CD19-CD34 CAR transduced T cells
Successful production of CD19-CD34 CAR product that meet predefined release criteria (cell viability/cell number/transduction efficiency/negative sterility and viral testing) for enrolled patients, 24 participants evaluated for determination of the feasibility of producing CD19-CD34 CAR T cells meeting the established release criteria, 18 months|Adverse events, 24 participants evaluated for adverse event and grading by using CTCAE v.5.0 to determine the maximal tolerated dose of CD19-CD34 CAR T cells with chemotherapy conditioning regimen for patients that have recurrent or refractory B cell malignancies, 15 years
Response to treatment, 24 participants evaluated for response to treatment by testing using PET/CT for lymphoma and using bone marrow aspirate for leukemia., 24 months|Progression free survival, 24 participants evaluated for progression by testing using PET/CT for lymphoma and using bone marrow aspirate for leukemia., 24 months|Overall survival, 24 participants evaluated for overall survival by clinical visit, 15 years
Immune response, 24 participants evaluated for immune response by blood tests., 15 years
Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) will be obtained by leukapheresis over one day and the cells will be transduced with an in house designed CAR retroviral vector. Participants will receive daily intravenous (IV) infusion of lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for total of 3 days (Days -5, -4, -3). The dose of cyclophosphamide will be given at 500mg/m2. The dose of fludarabine will be given at 30mg/m2. Participants will receive the CAR transduced T cells IV infusion in the BMT Inpatient Unit and remain admitted for close monitoring for at least the first 7 days following the cell infusion (D0 to Day +7), possibly longer if any side effects are encountered. The CAR transduced T cells will be escalated from 1 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) to 2 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) in a Phase I design, based on toxicity. Once discharged from the inpatient unit, for the next 7 days (Day +8 to Day +14) the patients will be evaluated in the High Dose Unit (labs and physical exam) to screen for toxicities.
