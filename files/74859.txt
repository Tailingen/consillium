Salvage Radiotherapy Combined With Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) With or Without Rezvilutamide in the Treatment of Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rezvilutamide in combination with androgen deprivation therapy(ADT) and standard salvage radiation therapy(SRT) or SRT combination with ADT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate-specific antigen(PSA) persistence after radical prostatectomy(RP).
