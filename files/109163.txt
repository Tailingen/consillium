Clinical Study on Nanocrystalline Megestrol Acetate for Appetite Improvement and Weight Gain in Pre-Cachexia and Cachexia Stages Key Terminology Analysis
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nanocrystalline medroxyprogesterone acetate for improving appetite and weight gain patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cachexia and pre-cachexia. The enrolled patients were those with advanced NSCLC who had not received therapy, negative for driver genes and ineligible for curative treatment, and were planned to receive PD-1 inhibitors in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.
