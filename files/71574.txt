Genetic Markers of Circulating Tumor DNA for Monitoring Breast Cancer Patients in Costa Rica
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a noninvasive test for breast cancer monitoring throughout the course of the disease
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Mutation, Point
Assessment of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) concentration (in ng/uL) obtained from peripheral blood (liquid biopsy)., Samples will be analyze with Real time PCR and fluorometric assay and compare with overall survival, 12 months|Number of somatic mutation findings in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from peripheral blood (liquid biopsy), Samples will be analyze with targeted NGS sequencing panel, 12 months
Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status, ER, PR, HER2 status, 24 months|Overall survival of participant, Overall survival of participant, 24 months|Cancer stage of participant, Cancer stage of participant, 24 months
The concentrations of the cell free DNA (cfDNA) and somatic mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in serial samples correlate with the number of days of the progression-free period and with the overall survival.
