Pre-Transplant 5-Azacitidine In Patients With High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Who Are Candidates For Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to find out if treating people who have high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 5-Azacitidine (Vidaza) prior to their allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is helpful in preventing their myelodysplastic syndrome from coming back.

In previous research, 5-Azacitidine appeared to help the bone marrow of a patient with MDS begin to function more normally. This means bone marrow cells can grow and do their work the way they were meant to. 5-Azacitidine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MDS. The effect of 5-Azacitidine in patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplants have not been studied.
Leukemia
DRUG: 5-azacitidine|PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)
Percentage of Participants With Relapse-free Survival (RFS), Relapse-free survival one year after allogeneic HCT in MDS patients receiving at least one complete cycle of 5-azacitidine (Vidaza) in the pre-transplantation setting. Relapsed disease: if with complete remission (CR) - greater than 5% blasts in bone marrow; if with partial response (PR) - greater than 30% increase in blasts in the marrow; if with stable disease (SD) - return to pretreatment peripheral blood levels and transfusion requirements due to disease., One year post allogeneic HCT
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Pre-allogeneic HCT responses to 5-azacitidine (Vidaza), based on the International Working Group criteria: Complete Remission (CR); Partial Response (PR); Stable Disease (SD). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the response rate to 5-azacitidine, evaluated at marrow evaluation after 4 cycles of 5-azacitidine or prior to HCT whichever came first. CR: Bone marrow with 5% myeloblasts and normal maturation of all cell lines. PR: All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except bone marrow blasts decreased by 50% over pretreatment but still \> 5%. SD: Failure to attain CR, PR, relapsed (or progressive) disease., At the end of up to six (28 day) cycles of 5-azacitidine|Percentage of Participants Who Proceed to Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), Proportion of patients enrolled who subsequently proceeded to allogeneic HCT., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival for all participants at one year after first dose of 5-azacitidine (Vidaza). Overall survival was calculated by the method of Kaplan-Meier with standard errors computed using Greenwood's formula., One year
RESEARCH PLAN

* This will be a single-center prospective trial
* Patients with high risk MDS that are potentially eligible for HCT will be enrolled.
* A donor search will be initiated, and 5-Azacitidine will be given per standard practice.
* 5-Azacitidine dose is 75 mg/M\^2/day subcutaneously by standard practice (generally this is 7 days per monthly cycle, but alterations occur depending on clinical and laboratory parameters).
* Patients where a suitable donor is not found can continue with 5-Azacitidine per standard treatment. These patients will be followed until progression of MDS to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or death, for up to one year.
* If a suitable donor is obtained, the patient will proceed to HCT. The HCT conditioning regimen will be dictated by the Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) physician. While waiting HCT, additional cycles 5-Azacitidine may be given. Pre-HCT conditioning regimen therapy will begin no more than 8 weeks and no less than 4 weeks after the last administration of 5-Azacitidine.
* As the number of cycles of 5-Azacitidine is not standardized and the retrospective review of our patients noted above indicated a benefit to ANY exposure to 5-Azacitidine, the actual number of cycles of 5-Azacitidine delivered will not be specified. In addition, as high risk MDS patients have an average time to death of 0.4 years, any delay to HCT once it is available is to be avoided.
* A bone marrow biopsy will be performed to reassess disease response to therapy after the last cycle of 5-Azacitidine before transplant, or after the fourth cycle of 5-Azacitidine, whichever comes first. Note that both the biopsy and the timing of the biopsy is a standard evaluation procedure.
* Donor progenitor cell collection will be prescribed by the BMT Attending Physician.

HCT

* The patient will undergo HCT designated per attending BMT physician.
* Supportive care will be based on institutional guidelines, Stem cell collections, processing and laboratory studies

Stem cell collections, processing and laboratory studies

* Graft assessment, processing, and characterization will be done as per institutional guidelines
* Chimerism testing will be obtained to document post-transplant engraftment, per standard practice.
