A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of BMS-986365 Versus the Investigator's Choice of Therapy in Participants With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of BMS-986365 versus the investigator's choice of therapy in participants with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BMS-986365|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Predinsone/Prednisolone
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (soft tissue) and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) (bone) criteria, Up to 4 years
Overall Survival (OS), Up to 4 years|Recommended dose of BMS-986365 for Part 2, Up to approximately 1.5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Up to 4 years|Confirmed overall response rate (ORR) by BICR assessment in participants with measurable disease using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) criteria, Up to 4 years|Time to pain progression (TTPP), Up to 4 years|Time to symptomatic progression (TTSP), Up to 4 years|Time to initiation of the first subsequent systemic therapy (TFST), Up to 4 years|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) total scores, Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) scores, Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in trial outcome index (TOI), Up to 4 years|Change from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) worst pain (item #3) intensity, Up to 4 years|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), Up to 4 years|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), Up to 4 years|Incidence of AEs leading to dose modifications, Up to 4 years|Incidence of AEs leading to interruptions, Up to 4 years|Incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation, Up to 4 years|Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, ECG Findings defined as :

* Number of Postbaseline Abnormal Corrected QT (QTc) Values
* Number of abnormal Beats Per Minute (BPM), Up to 4 years|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, Up to 4 years
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) of BMS-986365 versus investigator's choice comprising Docetaxel + Prednisone/Prednisolone or Abiraterone + Prednisone/Prednisolone or Enzalutamide.

In Part 1, participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the two BMS-986365 dose levels, or to the active comparator arm (investigator's choice). In Part 2 of the study, participants will be randomized 1:1 between BMS-986365 selected dose, or to the active comparator arm (investigator's choice).
