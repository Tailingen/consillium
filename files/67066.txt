Study on the Optimal Combination Pattern of the Combined Treatment of Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy for the Abscopal Effect in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Multiple Metastases
This study aims to conduct a prospective, multicenter, umbrella clinical study to compare the abscopal effects of different radiotherapy fractionation patterns combined with Benmelstobart, and to explore an efficient and low-toxic treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multiple metastases. The main objective is to explore and compare the control rates of abscopal lesions in NSCLC patients with multiple metastases when different radiotherapy fractionation patterns are combined with Benmelstobart.
NSCLC Stage IV Without EGFR/ALK Mutation
DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: Benmelstobart combined with Bevacizumab and chemotherapy
The remission rate of abscopal lesions, To evaluate the efficacy of Benmelstobart plus different radiotherapy fractionation modes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple metastases, as measured by the remission rate of abscopal lesions according to RECIST v1.1, From date of randomization, until disease progression , loss of clinical benefit ,withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Up to approximately 2 years
PFS, To evaluate the efficacy of Benmelstobart plus different radiotherapy fractionation modes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple metastases, as measured by progression-free survival rate according to RECIST v1.1, From date of randomization, until disease progression , loss of clinical benefit ,withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Up to approximately 2 years|OS, To evaluate the efficacy of Benmelstobart plus different radiotherapy fractionation modes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with multiple metastases, as measured by by overall survival, up to 5 years|AE, The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, From date of consent informed until 60 days after the last investigational product administration.
