Comparative Study of Different Neoadjuvant Therapies Before Radical Hysterectomy in Stage Ib2-IIa2 Cervical Cancer
For stage Ib2-IIa2 cervical cancer patients, neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy is one of the managements. Post-operative concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is necessary if the patients have high-risk factors, including positive surgical margin, parametrium and pelvic nodes. Our previous retrospective study showed that combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and brachytherapy reduced the proportion of post-operative concurrent chemo-radiotherapy compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.

In the present study, the patients with stage Ib2-IIa2 cervical cancer will receive either neoadjuvant chemo/brachytherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical hysterectomy and pelvic+/- para-aortic lymph node dissection. According to the surgical findings, post-operative chemo-radiotherapy will be performed.
