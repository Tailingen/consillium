Less Frequent IV Dosing & Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Study of Nemvaleukin Alfa (ALKS 4230) Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (ARTISTRY-3)
The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts. A single-center design for the tumor microenvironment (TME) cohort (Cohort 1), and a multicenter design for the less frequent intravenous (IV) dosing cohort (Cohort 2).
