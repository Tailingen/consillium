Rehabilitation Following Laparoscopic Colonic Surgery
The standard procedure for treating colonic cancer is changing from open surgery to laparoscopic surgery. Following open colonic surgery patients are fatigued and loss body mass and have a reduction in physical function, but the investigators do not know if this is also the case following laparoscopic surgery.

This study examines how fatigue, quality of life, physical function, and body composition changes following laparoscopic colonic surgery.

Patients are examined preoperatively and postoperative day 10 and 30.
