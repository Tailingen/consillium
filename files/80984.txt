A Study to Evaluate ICP-022 in Patients With R/R Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL)
The phase II clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ICP-022.

Safety, tolerability evaluation, and anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with R/R MZL will be evaluated in approximately 110 subjects. Pharmacokinetics of ICP-022 will be evaluated in approximately 20 subjects.
MZL
DRUG: ICP-022
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The efficacy measured by overall response rate (ORR) in Part II according to the 2014 International Working Group NHL, Up to 3 years
Occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE 4.03 grading criteria in Part I, The safety of ICP-022 measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE 4.03 grading criteria in Part I, Up to 3 years|Progressioin free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the first occurrence of progression or relapse as assessed by the investigator, or death from any cause. PFS for patients without disease progression, relapse, or death will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DR), Duration of response as defined as the period from the first response (at least PR) to treatment until evidence of disease progression, relapse or death of any cause. Patients alive without progression and relapse will be censored at the latest tumor assessment date or the stopping date., Up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the period from the induction registration to death from any cause. Patients who have not died until the time of the analysis will be censored at their last contact date., Up to 3 years|Area under the concentration time curve up to the time "t" (AUC(0-t)), Area under the concentration time curve up to the time "t" (AUC(0-t)) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|Maximum plasma drug concentrations (Cmax), Individual plasma concentrations of ICP-022 will be measured and Cmax will be calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|Time of maximum plasma drug concentrations (Tmax), Time of maximum plasma drug concentrations (Tmax) of ICP-022 will be recorded., up to 4 weeks|Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (t½), Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (t½) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|Area under the concentration time curve up to the last data point above LOQ (AUC(last)), Area under the concentration time curve up to the last data point above LOQ (AUC(last)) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks
