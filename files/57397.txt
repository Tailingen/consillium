A Study Investigating the Efficacy and Safety of LBL-007 Plus Tislelizumab in Combination With Bevacizumab Plus Fluoropyrimidine Versus Bevacizumab Plus Fluoropyrimidine in Participants With Unresectable or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of LBL-007 plus tislelizumab when administered in combination with bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine, and LBL-007 in combination with bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine versus bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine to participants with colorectal cancer.
Unresectable or Metastatic Microsatellite Stable/Mismatch Repair Proficient Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: LBL-007|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab or Bevacizumab biosimilar|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Phase 1b: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 \[NCI-CTCAE v5.0\])., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after last dose, initiation of new anticancer therapy, death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 28 months)|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by The Investigator in PD-L1 Positive Arms A and C, PFS, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 28 months
Phase 2: Objective Response rate (ORR) as Assessed by The Investigator in PD-L1 Positive Arms A and C and PD-L1 Negative Arms D and E, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from the time of randomization., Approximately 28 months|Phase 2: Duration of response (DOR) as Assessed by The Investigator in PD-L1 Positive Arms A and C and PD-L1 Negative arms D and E, DOR is defined as the time from the first confirmed objective response after randomization until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever comes first., Approximately 28 months|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by The Investigator in PD-L1 Negative Arms D and E, PFS, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 28 months|Phase 2: Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs characterized by type, frequency, severity as graded by NCI-CTCAE v5.0., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 30 days after the last dose, initiation of new anticancer therapy, death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 28 months)
