A Study of Health-Related Quality of Life in People With Multiple Myeloma Receiving Daratumumab or Lenalidomide
The purpose of this study is to compare maintenance therapy approaches in people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) that has responded well to a first round of treatment. The researchers will compare giving the usual maintenance therapy (lenalidomide) with giving daratumumab as maintenance therapy, and they will look at which drug gives participants a better health-related quality of life during treatment. The researchers will measure participants' quality of life using various questionnaires. This study will help researchers find out whether this different approach of giving daratumumab as maintenance therapy is better, the same as, or worse than the usual approach.
