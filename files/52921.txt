Nivolumab With Chemotherapy in Refractory MDS
There is evidence of involvement of checkpoint pathways, including PD-1, in the pathogenesis and resistance of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors was ineffective in a number of studies, indicating the presence of several mechanisms of resistance. This pilot study evaluates the safety and preliminary efficacy of nivolumab combination with currently existing treatments in MDS patients who failed at least one line of therapy. The study evaluates if there is a combination which induces objective responses.
