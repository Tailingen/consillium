A Tasisulam and Midazolam Drug Interaction Study in Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether tasisulam acts as an inducer of CYP3A using midazolam as a sensitive and specific probe substrate of CYP3A.

The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of tasisulam and midazolam given in combination and document any antitumor activity with tasisulam.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Tasisulam|DRUG: Midazolam
Midazolam Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Time Point With Measurable Concentrations (AUC 0-tlast), Period 1 and 2: Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-dose.|Midazolam Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Period 1 and 2: Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-dose.|Midazolam Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC 0-infinity), Period 1 and 2: Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-dose.
Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Number of participants with tumor response = number of participants with complete response (CR) + number of participants with partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is â‰¥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline to Day 15 of Maintenance Period up to 3 months|Tasisulam Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Period 2: Predose, preinfusion start, 1, 1.75, 2 (post end of infusion), 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 336 hours.|Tasisulam Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Above the Albumin Corrected Threshold (AUCalb), Tasisulam is highly bound to albumin. AUCalb is a surrogate measure of exposure to unbound (free) tasisulam., Period 2: Predose, preinfusion start, 1, 1.75, 2 (post end of infusion), 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 336 hours.
