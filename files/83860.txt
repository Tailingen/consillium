ThrombosomesÂ® in Bleeding Thrombocytopenic Patients Study
This prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 2, parallel, dose ranging, multidose trial will enroll patients into 3 Thrombosomes dose groups and 1 control liquid stored platelets (LSP) group in order to evaluate, in a dose-escalation manner, the safety, and impact on bleeding, and the preliminary effect on coagulation measures of increasing doses of allogeneic Thrombosomes in comparison to standard of care, LSP.
