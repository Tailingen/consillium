131I-L19SIP Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in Combination With External Beam Radiation in Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases From Solid Tumors
The aim of this Proof of Concept study is to determine the therapeutic potential of the L19SIP antibody, labeled with the radionuclide 131I in combination with external beam radiation, for the treatment of patients with multiple brain metastases following the promising results with this agent in previous clinical studies.

The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a pathological feature in most aggressive types of cancer. The presented study follows a Phase I and a subsequent Phase I/II dose finding and efficacy study with the same agent in patients with a variety of cancers where 131I-L19SIP had shown an excellent tolerability and therapeutic benefit for some patients enrolled in the study.
Brain Metastases From Solid Tumors
RADIATION: 131I-L19SIP Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in Combination With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT)
Uptake of 131I-L19SIP or 124I-L19SIP, Selective uptake of 131I-L19SIP or 124I-L19SIP in brain lesions, 2 days|Safety of combined administration of 131I-L19SIP and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), Safety will be assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests (including serum chemistries, hematology parameters) and the recording of adverse events. Treatment emergent adverse events will be summarized by CTCAE version 3 (and if possible by the RTOG/EORTG scale) and worse grade for all treated patients. Laboratory values and change in vital signs will be summarized., 13 months
Overall response, Intracranial, extra cranial and overall response, 12 months|Overall survival, 12 months|Clinical performance index in terms of Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), GPA score will be assessed at the screening visit, during treatment and follow-up., 12 months
