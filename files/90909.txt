PROCEDURE: Liver surgery / ablation
Establishment of a Liver Surgery and Ablation Registry, The primary objective of this study is to create a comprehensive registry of patients who have undergone liver surgery or liver ablation. This registry will serve as a foundation for future epidemiological studies, enabling the assessment of long-term outcomes, the identification of risk factors, and the evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. Data collected will include demographic information, medical history, surgical details, postoperative outcomes, and survival rates. By compiling this data, we aim to better understand the patient population and improve care for individuals undergoing liver surgery or ablation., 10 years
The purpose of this registry is to create a comprehensive list of individuals who have undergone liver surgery or liver ablation, allowing researchers and clinicians to assess their data in future studies if they meet the eligibility criteria. All patients who have received liver surgery or liver ablation procedures at our institution will be included in this registry.

Information collected as part of the registry will be used solely to assess potential participants' eligibility for research studies, allowing for the evaluation of long-term outcomes, identification of risk factors, and investigation of therapeutic interventions. This data will help to enhance the understanding of the patient population undergoing liver surgery and improve clinical practices.

A patient registry is an organized system that uses observational study methods to collect standardized clinical data and other relevant information. It aims to evaluate specific outcomes for individuals who have undergone liver surgery or ablation, serving scientific, clinical, and policy-related purposes. The registry will support the development of targeted research studies and provide valuable insights into the treatment and management of liver diseases.
