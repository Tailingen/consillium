Intraoperative Music Therapy in Gynecological Oncology
Background Perioperative anxiety and postoperative pain can impact surgical morbidity. We aimed to evaluate the effect of intraoperative music therapy in the reduction of immediate postoperative pain in patients undergoing gynecological oncology surgery within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. Secondary objectives include reduction in preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain overtime, neurohormonal response, morbidity, length of hospital stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction.

Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blinded single-center study including patients undergoing surgery for ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer over a period of 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receiving intraoperative music therapy (Group A) or undergoing standard management (Group B). A reduction in immediate postoperative pain was defined as a reduction in ≥2 points in the Verbal Rating Scale(VRS) at 4h postoperatively. Hemodynamic variables and blood samples were collected during the procedure for determination of cortisol levels. A scale of closed numeric questions (Likert-like) was used to assess patient satisfaction.

The reduction in postoperative pain in patients undergoing gynecological oncology surgery within the ERAS protocol with the use of music therapy., The main objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction in postoperative pain, defined as a reduction in two or more points in the VRS, in patients undergoing gynecological oncology surgery within the ERAS protocol with the use of music therapy. VRS is verbal rating score is a numeric rating scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. 0 means you have no pain; one to three means mild pain; four to seven is considered moderate pain; eight and above is severe pain., 1 year
