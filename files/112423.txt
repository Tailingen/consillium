A Phase I Study of AL8326 in Advanced Solid Tumor
1. Main purpose Objective to study the tolerance and safety of single and multiple administration of repeated 28-day cycles of AL8326 in patients with advanced solid tumor, observe the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
2. Secondary purpose 1) Preliminary analysis of the pharmacokinetic characteristics and efficacy of repeated 28-day cycles of AL8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors; 2) According to the results of phase I tolerance test and pharmacokinetics, appropriate dosage and regimen were recommended for phase II clinical trial;
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AL8326 tablets
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), To observe the durability and safety of AL8326 in patients with advanced solid tumor after single and multiple administration, observe the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)and the reversibility of toxicity;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To observe the durability and safety of AL8326 in patients with advanced solid tumor after single and multiple administration, observe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)，the relationship between toxicity and dose;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)
Cmax, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|Tmax, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|AUC0-t, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|AUC0-∞, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|Vd, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|Ke, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|CL, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|t1/2, The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Al8326 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumor were analyzed;, cycle1 (each cycle is 28-days)|Primary antitumor efficiency of AL8326, Patients with advanced solid tumors and their efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1., Every 3 cycles(each cycle is 28-days)
This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safetyand efficacy of 28-day cycles of AL8326 therapy. The study is divided into three parts.

1. Part I To evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and general safety during the first 28-day cycle of Al8326 therapy and to evaluate the MTD. It will include a evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort in a 3+3 design in.
2. Part II Subject will receive a dose from Part 1 of this study for continuous 28-Day cycles of therapy.
3. Part III This design adopts 3 + 3 dose de-escalation method for exploration. At the same time, the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics were observed.
