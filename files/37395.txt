Comparison of Outcomes of Multiple Platforms for Assisted Robotic - Prostate
The object of this exploratory clinical trial is to evaluate post-operative complications in a population that underwent Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) made with multiple platforms:

* DaVinci;
* Hugo;
* Versius.

The questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the estimation of the post-operative complications suggest something?
* Are differences (intra-operative, post-operative, oncological, functional, technical, and economic) among the three intervention approaches observable?

Participants will be invited to fill out questionnaires and join one of these three groups:

1. surgery with the daVinci platform;
2. surgery with the Hugo platform;
3. surgery with the Versius platform.
