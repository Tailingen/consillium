Medico-economic Evaluation Comparing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Performed by Helical Tomotherapy and Dynamic Arc Therapy in Prostate, Cervical and Anal Canal Cancers
The aim of the study is a medico-economic evaluation to estimate a cost differential between three modalities of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for cancers of the prostate, cervix and anal canal with pelvic lymph node irradiation : treatment with helical Tomotherapy and dynamic arc therapy using two different technologies: RapidArc or VMAT.
Prostate Cancer|Cervical Cancer|Anal Canal Cancers
RADIATION: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy
Medico-economic study : medical cost differential between 3 ways of Radiotherapy by IMRT (helical tomotherapy and dynamic arc therapy : RapidArc and VMAT)., Costs of the devices, maintenance costs ; personnel costs directly related to the medical therapeutic procedure (physicians, medical physicists, dosimetry, technicians)., 2 months
Others economic criteria, * the estimation of the cost differential by individualizing the preparation phase and phase radiation
* the analysis of the possible impact of learning in helical tomotherapy and dynamic arc therapy with VMAT and RapidArc measured on direct costs (depending on the age of implantation and equipment), 2 months|clinical response and safety of the treatment by radiotherapy, * Assess the skin and mucosal toxicity (acute, delayed) : CTCAEv3
* Assess the prognostic factors of onset of toxicity
* Assess oncological results, 18 Months (cervix and canal anal) or 36 months (prostate)
