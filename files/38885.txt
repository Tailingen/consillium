Vaccine Therapy Using Melanoma Peptides for Cytotoxic T Cells and Helper T Cells in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying four different vaccines using melanoma peptides from cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
BIOLOGICAL: incomplete Freund's adjuvant|BIOLOGICAL: melanoma helper peptide vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: multi-epitope melanoma peptide vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim|BIOLOGICAL: tetanus peptide melanoma vaccine
Cytotoxic T-cell Lymphocytes (CTL) Response Rate, Assessment of CTL response was based on a fold-increase in T cell response measure by interferon-gamma ELIspot assay., Immune response was assessed at pre-registrtion, in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
Helper T-cells Response to 6MHP, Helper T cell response was evaluated by tritiated thymidine proliferation assay with fresh/cryopreserved PBL in the presence of each of the helper peptides., Immune response was assessed at pre-registration, in weeks 1,3,5,7,8|Helper T Cell Response to Tetanus, Helper T cell response was evaluated by tritiated thymidine proliferation assay with fresh/cryopreserved PBL in the presence of each of the helper peptides., Immune response was assessed at pre-registration, in weeks 1,3,5,7,8|Objective Response Rate, Tumor response was assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. Objective response rate is calculated as the number of patients with complete response (disappearance of all lesions) or partial response () divided by total number of evaluable patients., Tumor response was assessed in weeks 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, and 6 months after last vaccination|Median Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from registration to death from any cause., assessed every 3 month within 2 years and every 6 months betwen 2 and 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the cytotoxic T-cell response to each of 12 melanoma peptides restricted by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A1, -A2, or -A3 in patients with metastatic melanoma vaccinated with or without these 12 melanoma peptides and with or without helper peptides.
* Compare the helper T-cell response to each of 6 melanoma helper peptides restricted by HLA-DR molecules in patients treated with these vaccinations.
* Determine whether the addition of 6 melanoma helper peptides to a vaccine containing multiple class I Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted peptides augments T-cell responses to the class I restricted peptides in these patients.
* Determine, preliminarily, whether booster vaccination maintains immune response in patients treated with these vaccinations.
* Compare the rates of clinical response and survival in patients treated with these vaccinations.
* Determine, preliminarily, whether cellular immune response correlates with clinical response and survival rates in patients treated with these vaccinations.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to HLA type (HLA-A1 vs HLA-A2 vs HLA-A1 and -A2 vs HLA-A3) and planned sentinel immunized node biopsy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive 2 injections of multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprising 12 melanoma peptides restricted by Class I MHC (12MP) emulsified with sargramostim (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF) and Montanide ISA-51 or Montanide ISA-51 VG (ISA-51) intradermally (ID) and subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and 1 injection at the primary site only on day 1 of weeks 5-7.
* Arm II: Patients receive 2 injections of multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprising 12MP and 1 tetanus helper peptide emulsified with GM-CSF and ISA-51 ID and SC on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and 1 injection at the primary site only on day 1 of weeks 5-7.
* Arm III (closed to accrual as of 5/19/08): Patients receive 2 injections of multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprising 12MP and 6 melanoma helper peptides (6HP) emulsified with GM-CSF and ISA-51 ID and SC on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and 1 injection at the primary site only on day 1 of weeks 5-7.
* Arm IV: Patients receive 2 injections of multi-epitope peptide vaccine comprising 6HP emulsified with GM-CSF and ISA-51 ID and SC on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and 1 injection at the primary site only on day 1 of weeks 5-7.

In all arms, patients continue therapy in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression necessitating other urgent therapy.

Patients are evaluated at 8 and 12 weeks. Beginning 2-3 weeks after the week-12 evaluation, patients with no evidence of disease progression may receive booster vaccinations according to their randomized treatment arm. Patients receive booster vaccination ID and SC once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 9 weeks for 1 course, every 12 weeks for 2 courses, and then every 24 weeks for 2 courses OR for up to 2 years (whichever comes first) provided the patient does not require an urgent change in therapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then for survival for 5 years from study randomization.

ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 175 patients were accrued for this study during March 2005 and January 2009.
