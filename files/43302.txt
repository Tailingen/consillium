Study of Temozolomide in Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Participants With Low O6-Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT) Expression (P05052)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of temozolomide in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) participants who are not candidates for standard induction therapy and exhibit low MGMT expression.
Leukemia, Acute Myeloid|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: temozolomide
Clinical Response at the End of Temozolomide Induction, Complete Response (CR): \< 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow (BM); Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \> 1.0 x 10\^9/L, platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L, and no extramedullary disease.

CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp): All the criteria of CR but with platelets \< 100 x 10\^9/L but ≥ 50 x 10\^9/L and platelet transfusion independent.

Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): complete clearance of blasts from marrow and blood, but criteria for CR or CRp not met.

Partial response (PR): decrease ≥ 50% BM blasts. Minimal Response (MR): decrease ≥ 25% but \<50% BM blasts., at the end of each cycle (approximately 4 weeks post start of cycle), up to a maximum 63 weeks
Duration of Response in Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Proceeding to Reduced Dose-intensity Maintenance Therapy With Temozolomide, Complete Response (CR): \< 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow (BM); Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \> 1.0 x 10\^9/L, platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L, and no extramedullary disease., Up to 1 year after treatment ends (up to 115 weeks)|Relapse-free Survival in Participants Achieving CR or CRp and Proceeding to Reduced Dose-intensity Maintenance Therapy With Temozolomide, Relapse-free survival was defined as time to disease progression. Complete Response (CR): \< 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow (BM); Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \> 1.0 x 10\^9/L, platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L, and no extramedullary disease. CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp): All the criteria of CR but with platelets \< 100 x 10\^9/L but ≥ 50 x 10\^9/L and platelet transfusion independent., Start of treatment until disease progression [up to 1 year after treatment ends (up to 115 weeks)]|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Achieving CR or CRp and Proceeding to Reduced Dose-intensity Maintenance Therapy With Temozolomide, OS was defined as the time from start of treatment until death or end of study.

Complete Response (CR): \< 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow (BM); Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \> 1.0 x 10\^9/L, platelets \> 100 x 10\^9/L, and no extramedullary disease. CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp): All the criteria of CR but with platelets \< 100 x 10\^9/L but ≥ 50 x 10\^9/L and platelet transfusion independent., Start of treatment until death or end of study [up to 1 year after treatment ends (up to 115 weeks)]|Number of Previously Untreated Participants With Low O6-Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT) Expression, Low MGMT expression was defined as MGMT/β-actin ratio \< 0.2. MGMT \& β-actin are cancer biomarkers., Baseline|MGMT Expression in Leukemic Blasts at the Time of Relapse, Low MGMT expression was defined as MGMT/β-actin ratio of \<0.2.

MGMT \& β-actin are cancer biomarkers., Up to 1 year after treatment ends (up to 115 weeks)|Number of Participants With CR, PR, or MLFS Who Received Modified Low Dose Maintenance Therapy (100 mg/m^2/Day x21 Days of Each 28 Day Cycle) and Experienced Toxicity, Toxicity was defined as any adverse event experienced by a participant regardless of causal relationship with study treatment. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, biologic (at any dose), or medical device, which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Adverse events may have included the onset of new illness and/or the exacerbation of preexisting conditions., From first dose to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to 67 weeks)|Progression-free Survival for Participants Achieving PR, MLSF, or MR, Progression-free survival was defined as time to disease progression. Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): complete clearance of blasts from marrow and blood, but criteria for CR or CRp not met. Partial response (PR): decrease ≥ 50% BM blasts. Minimal Response (MR): decrease ≥ 25% but \<50% BM blasts., Start of treatment until disease progression [up to 1 year after treatment ends (up to 115 weeks)]|Quality of Life (QoL) in Participants Receiving Long Term Temozolomide Therapy Assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Scores ranged from 0 -100. For functional and global QoL scales, higher scores meant a better level of function. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score meant more severe symptoms and a decrease in QoL., Baseline and post-study visit (63 weeks)|Quality of Life (QoL) in Participants Receiving Long Term Temozolomide Therapy Assessed by EORTC QLQ-LC13, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was a 13-item questionnaire developed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 in lung cancer patients. It had a score range 0-100 with higher scores representing an increase in symptoms., Baseline and post-study visit (63 weeks)|Quality of Life (QoL) in Participants Receiving Long Term Temozolomide Therapy Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-G, The FACT-G was a 27-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL in patients with chronic illnesses. Scores ranged from 0 to 28. For physical well being, lower scores indicated a better outcome. For functional well being, higher scores indicated a better outcome. For social \& emotional well being, whether a high score or a lower one indicated a better outcome depended on the question., Baseline and post-study visit (63 weeks)
