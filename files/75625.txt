Targeted Treatment Plus Tislelizumab and HAIC for Advanced CRCLM Failed from Standard Systemic Treatment
Hepatic arterial infuison chemothearpy (HAIC), targeted therapy, and programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM). Thus, the investigators will conduct a prospective trial to explore the efficacy and safety of targeted treatment based on ctDNA genotyping combined with tislelizumab and HAIC as salvage treatment for advanced CRCLM failed from standard systemic treatment, aiming to provide individualized optimized regimen for microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCLM in salvage treatment.

Although surgery has been demonstrated to improve the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM), only 20% of patients with CRCLM is candidate for surger. Irinotecan-/oxaliplatin-based doublet/triplet chemotherapy regimen combined with targeted therapy (anti vascular endothelial growth factor \[VEFG\] or anti epidermal growth factor receptor \[EGFR\]) based on the genotype are recommended as standard first- and second-line treatment for unresectabel metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by NCCN guideline. RAS and BRAF are the important signal members in the EGFR signal pathway, and the mutation of them could induce the persistent activation of the downstream of the MAPK pathway, leading to the differentiation, proliferation, and growth change of the tumor cell. The status of RAS and BRAF V600E mutation will affect the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, but not anti-VEGF therapy.

Regorafenib, fruquintinb, and TAS-102 have been recommended as third-line treatment for mCRC, while the survivl benefits from these agents are limited, with the median progression-free survival (PFS) and median OS of 1.9-3.7 months and 6.4-9.3 months, respectively.

The efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for CRCLM have been demonstrated by multiple trials and recommended by many guidelines worldwide. Fruquintinib, a small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting at VEGF 1-3, has been demonstrated to change the tumor microenvironment and enhance the anti-tumor effect of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. Anti-EGFR rechallenge (cetuximab rechallenge) was effective in patients with CRC who interrupted the anti-EGFR therapy while responsed to anti-EGFR therapy in the first-line treatment. In 2021, a phase II trial, which explore the efficacy and safety of cetuximab rechallenge combined with Avelumab for pretreated RAS wide type (WT) mCRC. Our retrospective study (unpublished) showed HAIC combined with fruquintinib and tislelizumab presented greater efficacy for MSS CRCLM.

Thus, the investigators will conduct a prospective trial to explore the efficacy and safety of targeted treatment based on ctDNA genotyping combined with tislelizumab and HAIC as salvage treatment for advanced CRCLM failed from standard systemic treatment, aiming to provide individualized optimized regimen for MSS CRCLM in salvage treatment.
