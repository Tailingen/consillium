Dendritic Cell Vaccine for Head and Neck Cancer
This research study is testing a new treatment of cancer of the head and neck.

Purpose

This research study is being done to:

1. Test the safety of the experimental cancer vaccine made of dendritic cells. An experimental vaccine is one that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
2. To learn what effects (good and bad) the vaccine will have on you and your head and neck cancer.
3. To learn if the vaccine will stimulate your body's white blood cells, which are part of your immune system (your body's natural defense system).
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
BIOLOGICAL: dendritic cell vaccine
safety, 5 years|Efficacy as measured by RECIST criteria, 5 years
Characterize the immune response to the vaccine, 2 years
White blood cells are part of the body's defense system. Sometimes when you have cancer, your body does not know that the cancer cells are making you sick. We hope to teach your white blood cells to find and destroy your cancer cells with a vaccine. The vaccine will be made from a special kind of blood cell called a dendritic cell. This is the cell that will carry the information about your cancer to your white blood cells in your body.
