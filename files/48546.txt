Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy in Unresectable Recurrent Loco-regionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is an open-label, multi-center, phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of postponing or omitting re-irradiation after systemic therapy with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in patients with unresectable recurrent loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients who did not respond to or progressed on another ICI are allowed to receive tislelizumab rechallenge as a subgroup.

High dose reirradiation is usually recommended for unresectable recurrent loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, it potentially adds to the RT-related severe toxicities and deaths. This trial aims to investigate the feasibility of postponing or even omitting re-irradiation based on effective first-line systemic therapy with tislelizumab and chemotherapy. For patients that progressed after exposure to another PD-1 antibody,tislelizumab rechallenge is accepted as a second subgroup.In this trial, all patients will receive chemotherapy (on doctors' recommendation) and PD-1 antibody (tislelizumab 200mg every three weeks). Patients with no response to the systemic therapy will receive salvage low dose re-irradiation delivered by SBRT, while those who showed complete or partial response will continue maintenance therapy until progression, death or intolerable toxicity, and reirradiation will be postponed or omitted.
