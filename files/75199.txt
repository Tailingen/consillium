Safety Study of the Hypo-fractionated (Large Doses) Radiation Therapy in Post-menopausal Women With Breast Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine whether high dose of radiation therapy (RT) are effective over standard 6-week radiation treatment in patients with breast cancer
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: 6 Gy/ fraction
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 5 years
TGF-beta 1 determinations, Blood specimens will be collected by venipuncture, before starting treatment, immediately after the last treatment fraction, From baseline to up to 4 weeks|Ultrasound for target localization, Ultrasound is ideal for imaging soft tissues unobstructed by bone and has been used successfully in conjunction with the treatment of prostate cancer to verify compliance between the daily location of the prostate and the planned location with respect to the treatment linear accelerator. By using ultrasound to image the post-operative tumor bed of the breast in "real-time", the operator may automatically align the tumor bed with treatment machine on each day of treatment, up to 4 weeks
Hypo-fractionation (several large fractions as the only radiation treatment) for breast cancer irradiation was common in the forties and 50s and, while very successful in achieving tumor control, was found to leave significantly inferior cosmetic results due to severe fibrosis and telangiectasia compared to those obtained with multiple fraction regimens (38-40). These complications were due to the use of very large fields, with the inclusion of a large proportion of uninvolved skin and tissue surrounding the tumor.

Based on these assumptions, a few large fractions can be safely delivered to breast cancers provided that 1) the target volume is sufficiently small and 2) the radiation technique assures maximum sparing of the surrounding normal tissue. Conformal RT to the tumor bed of T1 breast cancers satisfies both requirements.
