Ixazomib and Metabolites as Percent of Total Radioactivity in Plasma, The plasma samples were pooled for participants over 816 hrs post-dose, and data was analysed using the Hamilton method time-proportional pooling, and therefore the data is reported as "percent of total radioactivity in plasma" with measure type as "number" and measure dispersion as "Not applicable, NA"., Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 816 hrs) post-dose|Ixazomib and Metabolites as Percent of Total Dose Administered in Urine, The 35-day post-dose data is extrapolated from the average of four participant data from 0-168-hr pooled urine. The data is therefore reported as "percentage of dose" with measure type as "number" and measure dispersion as "NA"., Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to Day 35) post-dose|Ixazomib and Metabolites as Percent of Total Dose Administered in Feces, The 35-day post-dose data is extrapolated from the average of four participant data from 0-168-hr pooled feces. The data is therefore reported as "percentage of dose" with measure type as "number" and measure dispersion as "NA"., Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to Day 35) post-dose|Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Baseline up to Cycle 5 Day 45|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Investigations System Organ Class for Laboratory Values, Baseline up to Cycle 5 Day 45|Number of Participants With TEAEs Related to Vital Signs, Vital signs included oral body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure., Baseline up to Cycle 5 Day 25
