Fluorescence Guided Minimally-Invasive Resection Of Abdominal Paragangliomas Using Indocyanine Green
This study is exploring whether it's possible to detect paragangliomas (a rare type of tumor) during minimally invasive surgery by using a technique called near-infrared fluorescence imaging, guided by a substance called indocyanine green (ICG). The goal is to see if this method can help surgeons identify and treat paragangliomas more accurately and during minimally invasive procedures.

DRUG: Fluorescence guided identification using indocyanine green
Feasibility of real-time in-vivo identification of suspected paraganglioma's using Near-Infrared-fluorescence ICG imaging, The primary outcome of this retrospective study is the ability to visually detect the proportion (%) of suspected pre-operatively identified lesions (paraganglioma) in the abdomen during minimally invasive procedures using Near-Infrared-fluorescence ICG imaging, perioperatively/periprocedurally, within 30 minutes after intravenous administration of the fluorescent dye, up until a maximum of 120 minutes after start of surgery.
Accuracy of the detection of suspected lesions using Near-Infrared-fluorescence ICG imaging, The secondary outcome of this retrospective study is the accuracy, measured by sensitivity and specificity to identify abdominal paragangliomas using using Near-Infrared-fluorescence ICG imaging, Postoperatively, at the moment the definitive pathology result is known, approximately five days after surgery
