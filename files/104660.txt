Antarctic Krill Oil Functional Food Mitigates Bladder Cancer Treatment Side Effects
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of Antarctic krill oil in reducing side effects of intravesical therapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A total of 210 participants (18-75 years) will be randomized to receive either 2g/day of krill oil capsules (containing phospholipids, DHA, EPA, and astaxanthin) or placebo during intravesical treatment (epirubicin, pirarubicin, or BCG).

Primary outcomes include bladder irritation symptoms (IPSS score), systemic adverse events, hematuria, and urinary tract infections. Secondary outcomes assess quality of life (QoL). Safety will monitor adverse events per CTCAE v5.0.

The study follows GCP standards and includes rigorous data management and ethical oversight. Results may offer a dietary intervention to improve treatment tolerance and QoL for bladder cancer patients.

The degree of relief from bladder irritation symptoms., To evaluate whether krill oil can significantly alleviate symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and pain during urination, a symptom scoring system (e.g., the International Prostate Symptom Score, IPSS) can be used, From the start to the end of bladder instillation therapy，Monthly follow-up visits are continued until the end of perfusion therapy and last approximately 1 year|Incidence of systemic adverse reactions, Record and compare the systemic adverse reactions (such as nausea, fatigue, fever, rash, etc.) between the experimental group and the control group during the treatment period and after the treatment has concluded., From the start to the end of bladder instillation therapy，Monthly follow-up visits are continued until the end of perfusion therapy and last approximately 1 year|Incidence of Hematuria, Record and compare the occurrence of hematuria in the experimental group and the control group during and after treatment., From the start to the end of bladder instillation therapy，Monthly follow-up visits are continued until the end of perfusion therapy and last approximately 1 year|Incidence of urinary tract infection, Assess the frequency of urinary tract infections through routine urinalysis, urine culture, and symptom monitoring., From the start to the end of bladder instillation therapy，Monthly follow-up visits are continued until the end of perfusion therapy and last approximately 1 year
Quality of life score, The quality of life of study participants during and after treatment was assessed using the Quality of Life Scale (Qol) The quality of life of study participants during and after treatment was assessed using the Quality of Life Scale (Qol)., From the start to the end of bladder instillation therapy，Monthly follow-up visits are continued until the end of perfusion therapy and last approximately 1 year
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Antarctic krill oil functional food in alleviating side effects of intravesical therapy for bladder cancer. The study will enroll 210 participants (105 per group) aged 18-75 years with histologically confirmed non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who are scheduled to undergo postoperative intravesical therapy (e.g., epirubicin, pirarubicin, or BCG). Participants will be randomized to receive either 2g/day of krill oil capsules (containing phospholipids, DHA, EPA, and astaxanthin) or placebo (olive oil capsules) during their intravesical treatment period.

The primary outcomes include the reduction in bladder irritation symptoms (assessed via IPSS score), incidence of systemic adverse events (e.g., nausea, fatigue), hematuria, and urinary tract infections. Secondary outcomes focus on quality of life (QoL) improvements using standardized questionnaires. Safety monitoring will track adverse events related to krill oil or intravesical therapy, graded per CTCAE v5.0 criteria.

Statistical analyses will compare groups using t-tests, chi-square tests, repeated-measures ANOVA, and Cox regression models. The study anticipates a medium effect size (d=0.5) with 90% power and accounts for a 20% dropout rate. Conducted across three centers in China (Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital, and Shandong Provincial Hospital), the trial adheres to GCP standards and includes rigorous data management, adverse event reporting, and ethical oversight. Results may offer a novel dietary intervention to improve tolerance and quality of life for bladder cancer patients undergoing intravesical therapy.
