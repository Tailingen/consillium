Smoking Cessation in Women With Gynecological Conditions
This feasibility study will compare two smoking cessation methods, traditional nicotine replacement therapy and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic cigarettes) in patients with gynecological conditions.
Cervical Dysplasia
OTHER: Nicotine Replacement Therapy|DEVICE: Electronic Cigarettes
Composite set of questions about the feasibility of successfully using NRT and ENDS over time (assessing change in smoking habits) in Women with Serious Gynecological Conditions, To determine the acceptability of traditional nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch plus nicotine gum or lozenges) and the ENDS (electronic nicotine delivery system or electronic cigarette as smoking cessation tools in a group of women with cervical dysplasia from the Stephenson Cancer Center Dysplasia Clinics.

Measurements to assess success:

1. Reduction of number of cigarettes smoked per day.
2. Point prevalence abstinence at 7 and 30 days
3. Smoking cessation rates
4. Qualitative interviews to assess positives and negatives in these two smoking cessation methods., We plan a 3-month study with 6 week follow-up periods.
Feasibility of Study, To determine if we can accure 30 smoking women with cervical dysplasia from the Stephenson Cancer Center for smoking cessation intervention in a 6-month window., 3 months with 6 week follow-up windows
Product Adherence Diary, The diary will be used for the 6 week intervention portion of the study. This diary is designed to assist individuals in monitoring their smoking and product use during the study. We will encourage each subject to write down every regular cigarette that she smokes as well as every use of the product to which she has been randomized., Women fill out diary every day for 12 weeks|Composite set of semi-structured interviews, We will use semi-structured interviews at the 12 week follow-up to help us understand:

* If the woman currently feels she has a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle, and what factors contribute to this answer.
* What smoking cessation methods the women have tried in the past, if the methods were acceptable, if they worked, and why or why not.
* Barriers that might make it difficult for women with this diagnosis to quit smoking using the device they tried in the study.
* Assists that might make it easier for women with this diagnosis to quit smoking using the device they tried in the study.
* How the women feel about continuing to use the device that they tried in the trial.
* Risks the women feel they are taking if they continue to use NRT, ENDS, or decide to return to smoking.
* What about smoking makes it worth or not worth the risk to these women personally., done at the end of the study (at 12-weeks)
This study will allow women with serious gynecological conditions to sample both traditional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic cigarettes, ENDS). Whether the woman samples NRT or ENDS first will be randomized. Women will choose the product they wish to try for a 6-week intervention period for smoking cessation. Women choosing NRT will receive a 6-week intervention of a daily nicotine patch plus either nicotine gum or lozenges to use (as needed) throughout the day. The ENDS group will receive an electronic cigarette device with refills to last the 6-week duration of the study. Both groups will receive identical tobacco cessation counseling. As part of the study, each subject will complete a survey conducted at baseline, 6-weeks into the study during intervention, and upon completion of a 6 week follow-up period in which participants receive no intervention. At the 12-week measurement period we will add a qualitative interview that will allow us to ask the women whether the methods were acceptable, caused any problems, and if so, what the problems entailed.
