Effects of PECS 1 Block on Venous Cancer Port Catheter
In this study our aim is to investigate the effects of ultrasound (USG) guided pectoral block (PECS) type 1 in the administration of an implanted port-a-cath .
Catheter; Pain (Indwelling Catheter)
PROCEDURE: Port-a-cath replacement
Perioperative and postoperative analgesic needs of patients, Our primary outcome is to measure and identify the analgesic needs of the patients at the perioperative and postoperative period.In order to measure the analgesic needs Visual Analogue Scale will be used and patients' pain scores will be measured., Change in Visual analog Scale (VAS) scores ( between 1 and 10, a higher score represents greater pain intensity. ) at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th hours after the procedure.
Hemodynamic parameters at the perioperative and postoperative period, Our secondary outcome is to measure the hemodynamic parameters such as systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at the perioperative and postoperative period., 1st, 3rd, 6th,12th and 24th hours after the procedure.
Cancer is one of the most important reasons of mortality in the world. There are a lot of different types of treatments for cancer and so far chemotherapy is the most common one. However, chemotherapy damages the peripheral veins, so implanted subcutaneous port-a-caths are used as an alternative. Traditionally this implantation is adminstered with infiltrative anesthesia. Recently, USG is used in anesthesia practice world wide. Blanco R et all (1) defined PECS 1 block as an alternative to paravertebral block. PECS 1 block aims to anesthetize the medial and lateral pectoral nerves. In this study our aim is to investigate the effects of USG guided PECS 1 block in the administiration of an implanted port-a-cath .
