Sentinel Node in Endometrial Cancer
Phase II, open-label, randomized pilot study.

Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive for sentinel node screening:

1. Radiotracer (RT) via cervical administration and TUMIR
2. Combination of RT with Indocyanine Green (RT + ICG) via cervical administration and TUMIR Patients will be followed up to 1 month after the last administration of radiotracer 70 patients will be included into the study.
