Early Warning Model of Susceptibility and High-risk Population of Cervical Cancer Related to HPV
Most uterine cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are transient, with only a small fraction developing into cervical cancer. Family aggregation studies and heritability estimates suggest a significant inherited genetic component. Candidate gene studies and previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) report associations between the HLA region and cervical cancer. Adopting a genome-wide approach, we aimed to establish an early warning model for a high-risk population of cervical cancer.
