Observational Study in Patients Who Underwent an Haploidentical Transplantation With T-repleted Bone Marrow
Outcome evaluation in patients who underwent transplantation with T-repleted bone marrow after post-transplantation cyclophosphamide
Hematologic Malignancy
toxicity evaluation, Chronic and acute GVHD, infectious complications, graft failure, TRM, 1 year
Patients who underwent transplantation with T-repleted bone marrow haploidentical transplantation will be analyzed considering toxicity incidence (GVHD, infective complications, graft-failure incidence and TRM)and efficacy variables (Overall Survival, Progression Free Survival and Relapse incidence)
