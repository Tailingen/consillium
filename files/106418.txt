Radioembolisation and Chemotherapy in Liver Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this multicentre clinical pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of the addition of Ho-166 radioembolization to chemotherapy in patients with liver metastastic breast cancer.

Participants will receive a mapping angiography and Ho-166 radioembolization. Chemotherapy will be stopped 2-5 prior to radioembolization and continuation of chemotherapy will be evaluated at 2 weeks post-radioembolization.

Feasibility, The percentage of patients were radioembolization and systemic chemotherapy is safely feasible. Safety is defined as percentage of 90 day post-radioembolization (CTCAE/SIR grade 3 or higher) which lead discontinuation of the current systemic chemotherapy. Time to re-start chemotherapy after intervention in days will be collected., Up to 3 months after intervention
Lesion- and patient-based response, Radiological response on contrast-enhanced CT and MRI measured by RECIST, Up to 3 months after intervention|Overall toxicity associated with study intervention, Graded by CTCAE/SIR grade, Up to 3 months after intervention|Quality of Life during study, Obtained by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, From start inclusion to 3 months after intervention
