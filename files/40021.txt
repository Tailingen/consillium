TOMO Versus IMRT in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients
Tomotherapy is a new radiation planning and delivery technology which may allow for delivery of higher radiation doses with less damage to normal tissues. The investigators aim to compare the treatment efficacy and quality of life between tomotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: TOMO|RADIATION: IMRT
QoL(quality of life), Changes in quality of life were assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, 2 years
PFS (progression free survival), from the first day of therapy to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever was first (according the criterion of RECIST 1.1 )., 2 years|OS (overall survival), from the first day of therapy to death or last follow-up, 2 years|LRRFS(Locoregional failure-free survival), from the first day of therapy to the date of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 2 years|Adverse Events, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 50 days and every 3 months thereafter for 5 years. Observe and record the toxicity profile (including but not limit to mucositis, liver and kidney function, et al.) according NCI-CTCAE 4.03 during the chemoradiation and follow-up., 5 years
