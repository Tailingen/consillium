Simvastatin Effect on Radiation Therapy of Brain Metastases
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin in combination with radiotherapy on the clinical outcomes of patients with brain metastases.
Brain Metastases
DRUG: simvastatin in addition to radiation therapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy
a- Response rate, brain CT/MRI will be done at baseline and 4 weeks after radiotherapy to evaluate the reduction in tumor size, 4 weeks after radiation therapy
progression free and overall survival, it measures time from treatment initiation to either progression or death from any cause, up to 6 months|adverse effects, any adverse/side effect will be evaluated, during the treatment period
quality of life, measures the patient quality of life, baseline, after radiation therapy, 6 weeks, 18 weeks, 30 weeks|cognitive function assessment using Montreal cognitive assessment test, assess the patient cognitive function by the evaluation of Montreal cognitive assessment test score, baseline, after radiation therapy, 6 weeks, 18 weeks, 30 weeks|serum s100 B protein, evaluate serum s100 B protein at baseline and after 2 weeks, baseline, after radiation therapy
Despite current advances in therapies, the outcome for patients with brain metastases is fatal. New therapeutic approaches, such as radiosensitizing agents, are needed to provide a significant survival advantage for those patients. Statins have been reported to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in addition to a neuroprotective effect. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases and on improving patients' quality of life.
