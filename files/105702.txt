MarginProbe, a Device for Intraoperative Assessment of Margin Status in Breast Conservation Surgery
The purpose of this study is to show that addition of device use to a routine breast cancer tumor excision procedure is beneficial and assists the surgeon in correctly determining the extent of excision.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: MarginProbe|PROCEDURE: Lumpectomy
The Primary Effectiveness Endpoint is a Measure of Intraoperative Success in Addressing Positive Margins as Detected by Permanent Pathology)by Additional Oriented Tissue Re-excision From the Surgical Cavity., Tests the efficacy of the device to intra-operatively assess positive margins (superiority) - CSR is 'positive' when all positive margins, as detected by histology, on the main specimen addressed intra-operatively, two weeks after surgery
The study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double arm study demonstrating the effectiveness of the device in adjunctive use for locating the tissue for additional excision following primary specimen excision. One arm is a "Standard of Care" (SOC) Control group and the other arm a "Device+SOC" group.In the "Device +SOC" group the surgeon will use the MarginProbe device on the tissue specimen removed during the surgical procedure.The surgeon will use the results derived from the device and other routine assessments to decide if it is necessary to remove some additional breast tissue.
