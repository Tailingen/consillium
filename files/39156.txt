Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., First dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values Reported as AEs, Standard safety laboratory tests included Chemistry and Hematology. Abnormal laboratory values that led to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or were considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline were reported as AEs., First dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change in Weight Reported as AEs, Change relative to baseline in participant's weight measured throughout study., First dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change in Vital Sign Reported as AEs, Vital signs will include body temperature (oral), sitting blood pressure (after the participant has rested for at least 5 minutes), and pulse (bpm)., First dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 12 months)
The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult participants with advanced solid tumors or relapsed refactory lymphoma. The study will look at the effect of the pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of alisertib in the presence and absence of itraconazole.

This is an open label study. Participants will receive:

* Alisertib tablets 30 mg in Part A and 50 mg in Part B
* Itraconazole oral solution 200 mg in Part A

Participation in Part A is approximately 25 days. Part B participation is repeating 21-day cycles. The maximum duration of treatment with alisertib will be 12 months (approximately 16 cycles) unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by the sponsor, that a participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months.

This multi-center study will take place in the United States.
