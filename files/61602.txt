A Clinical Research of LeY-Targeted CAR-T in Myeloid Malignancies
The overall purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of LeY-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.

Lewis -Y（LeY） is a difucosylated carbohydrate antigen and although its function is not known, it is expressed on a wide range of malignancies including myeloid malignancies. LeY-targeted CAR-T in myeloid malignancies had been explored and showed good efficiency in the treatment of myeloid malignancies. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of LeY-targeted CAR-T.
