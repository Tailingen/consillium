A Pharmacokinetic Study of RO5185426 in Combination With a Drug Cocktail in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
This open-label single-arm study will evaluate the effect of RO5185426 \[RG7204; PLEXXIKON: PLX4032\] on the pharmacokinetics of five CYP450 substrates (caffeine, warfarin + vitamin K, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam) administered as a drug cocktail to patients with metastatic melanoma. The study will also evaluate efficacy and safety of RO5185426. On day 1, patients will receive the drug cocktail. On days 6 to 19, patients will receive RO5185426 twice daily. On day 20, patients will receive RO5185426 and the drug cocktail and on days 21 to 25, patients will receive RO5185426. Assessments will be made at regular intervals during the dosing periods and at follow-up. Patients may continue on study treatment (RO5185426) until the development of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Target sample size \<50.
