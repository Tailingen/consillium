A Prospective Multicenter Sample Collection Study Using Non-invasive Methods to Investigate Mutation Burden in Non-lesional Facial Skin of Patients With a Hx of Skin Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, sample collection study using DermTech's non-invasive skin collection kits to evaluate the mutation burden of non-lesional facial skin from subjects with a documented history of numerous basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas or melanomas compared to that of subjects with no history of skin cancer matched for age, sex and Fitzpatrick phototype.
Melanoma and Other Malignant Neoplasms of Skin
OTHER: Observational Study Only
Evaluate genomic changes associated with increased risk of skin cancers, Non-invasively assess skin samples collected from facial skin from participants with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers and melanoma skin cancer compared to age, sex and Fitzpatrick phototype controls, 1- year
Evaluate the potential differences in the number and/or type of mutations in non-lesional skin in solid organ transplant recipients, Non-invasively assess skin samples collected from facial skin from solid organ transplant recipients., 1-year
This is a prospective, multicenter, sample collection study using DermTech's non-invasive skin collection kits to evaluate the mutation burden of non-lesional facial skin from subjects with a documented history of numerous basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas or melanomas compared to that of subjects with no history of skin cancer matched for age, sex and Fitzpatrick phototype.

Approximately 20-30 participants will be enrolled in each of six (6) main groups outlined below for a total of 120-180 subjects and controls:
