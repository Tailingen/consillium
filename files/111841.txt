Comparison of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Surgery for Visceral Obesity in Mid-Low Rectal Cancer: A Propensity-Matched Analysis
Our team has previously published articles providing detailed descriptions of the steps involved in both RS and LS. All surgeries adhered to the total mesorectal excision (TME) principle. In RS, a surgeon employed the Da Vinci Xi surgical system featuring a five-port setup, while five physicians conducted LS with a similarly configured five-port approach. Both the RS and LS doctors are experienced. The surgeries were conducted according to standard procedures, and the RS group utilized totally robotic rectal resection.
