Safety Study of Vx006 Vaccine in Solid Tumor Patients
Patients with histologically proven malignancy with documented disease control (objective response or stable disease) or Not Evaluable Disease (NED) expectancy \> 6 months; only HLA-A\*02 positive patients.

The primary objective of the trial is to compare safety and tolerability of four different doses of Vx-006. The secondary objective is to compare immunogenicity of four different doses of the Vx-006.

Adverse event number by treatment group as a measure of safety and tolerability, The following parameters of safety and tolerability will be assessed:

* Physical examination and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, weight, height (only at baseline),
* Electrocardiogram,
* Adverse event evaluation,
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status,
* Clinical laboratory evaluation: haematology and clinical chemistry
* Collection of concomitant medication, 18 Weeks
Immune response evaluation by treatment group as a measure of efficacy, 18 weeks
