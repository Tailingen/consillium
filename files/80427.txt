Evaluation of Maximum Tolerated Dose, Safety and Efficiency of MSC11FCD Therapy to Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients
This is a phase I trial evaluating the maximum tolerated dose, safety and efficiency of Mesenchymal stem cells into which the suicide gene, cytosine deaminase (CD), injected into the resection cavity of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma|Adult Gliosarcoma|Neoplasms, Brain|Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal|Recurrent Glioblastoma
DRUG: MSC11FCD
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Assessment of the maximum tolerated dose based on the 3+3 method

* Blood concentrations of 5-FC and 5-FU(Day 1, Day 3, Day 7)
* MSC11FCD concentrations (MSCCD detection) (Day 0, 3months, 6months, 12months), after treatment discontinuation for approximately 1 years|Number Of Adverse Events related to the treatment, Evaluate the number of adverse event related to the treatment according to CTCAE V4.0 during the trial (including clinically significant changes in physical examination, radiographic images, safety lab tests, vital signs), Baseline, Day0, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months
Overall Survival improvement (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of MSC injection to the date of death due to any cause., Study entry through the end of the study, up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The progress-free survival analysis shall be based on the RANO criteria., Study entry through the end of the study, up to 12 months|Tumor assessment in regard to the investigational drug based on the RANO criteria, Assess the treatment groups participating in this clinical trial based on the RANO criteria.

Compare and present the disease control rates by calculating the ratio of the number of subjects responding to treatment (complete response: CR, partial response: PR, stable disease: SD) among the treatment groups and control group assessed based on the RANO criteria., At Baseline, 1month, 3months, 6months, 12months|Clinical efficacy assessment, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) assessment, At Baseline, 1month, 3months, 6months, 12months
