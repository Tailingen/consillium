A Combination of Acalabrutinib With R-CHOP for Patient Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
Previously untreated CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) requiring full course chemoimmunotherapy.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: R-CHOP + acalabrutinib
Phase I: Dose limiting toxicity of acalabrutinib combined to R-CHOP, Define recommended dose for Phase II evaluation of acalabrutinib with R-CHOP examining safety and toxicity of combination, 18 months|Phase II: Overall response rate of the combination acalabrutinib and R-CHOP, Document anti-tumour activity of acalabrutinb in combination wit R-CHOP in patients with previously untreated CD20 positive DLBCL, 36 months|Safety of the combination acalabrutinib and R-CHOP as determined by treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03., To determine additional safety information of acalabrutinib in combination with R-CHOP by treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03., 12 months
Pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib using area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of acalabrutinib when given in combination with R-CHOP in patients with DLBCL, 24 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of acalabrutinib, To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of acalabrutinib when given in combination with R-CHOP in patients with DLBCLPK parameter., 24 months|Time after administration when maximum concentration of acalabrutinib in the plasma is reached (Tmax), To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of acalabrutinib when given in combination with R-CHOP in patients with DLBCL, 24 months|Time required for concentration of acalabrutinib to reach half original value (T1/2), To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of acalabrutinib when given in combination with R-CHOP in patients with DLBCL, 24 months|Overall response rate of the combination acalabrutinib and R-CHOP according to cell of origin., To evaluate the effect of acalabrutinib in combination with R-CHOP on outcomes according to cell of origin, 24 months|Two years progression-free survival, To measure the duration of response to acalabrutinib in combination with R-CHOP over a follow-up period of 2 years, 24 months|Two years overall survival, To measure the duration of response to acalabrutinib in combination with R-CHOP over a follow-up period of 2 years, 24 months
Open-label non-randomised phase Ib/II study conducted in two stages. Stage 1 will be dose escalation in a modified classical 6+6 design. Stage 2 will be an expansion cohort to gain additional information on safety and efficacy at the recommended phase II dose of acalabrutinib.
