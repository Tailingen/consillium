A Pilot Study to Investigate the Clinical Utility of the Peregrine Monte Carlo Dose Calculation System for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning
The utility of PEREGRINE Monte Carlo calculations for radiation treatment planning in a clinical setting will be assessed by comparing results with other fully three-dimensional programs. ROB will investigate PEREGRINE for clinical use at NCI in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).
