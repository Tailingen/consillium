New derived variable for normalization of endometrium thickness:

1 = Endometrium thickness \<=5mm 0 = Endometrium thickness \>5mm, Baseline, Month 12|Change From Baseline in IBCSG LASA Items Scores - QoL Module 24-26, Assessment of severity of 13 items (Being irritable, Sweats, Vaginal discharge, dryness, and itching/irritation, Sleep disturbance, Feeling dizzy, Headaches, Bone or joint pain, Troubled by weight gain, Loss of sexual interest, Difficulties in becoming aroused - all from none to severe, and Bothered by treatment related difficulties (not at all to severely).
