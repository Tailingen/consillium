tReatment Individualisation By EBV stratificatiON in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: an Umbrella Platform Study (RIBBON-Umbrella)
This is a prospective platform study that will investigate the outcomes of patients with locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) or recurrent-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC) who are assigned to treatment arms of different chemotherapy sequencing and intensity based on their pre- and on-treatment plasma EBV DNA results.

Saliva samples will be collected at baseline and at point of recurrence., baseline, mid/post IC, mid CCRT, 1-2 weeks post-RT, 3 months post-RT/mid-adjuvant chemotherapy, at point of recurrence and post immune checkpoint blockade treatment (for recurrence, if any) up to 5 years
The primary objectives of this platform are: (1) to prospectively validate the prognostic potential of an EBV DNA-based risk-stratification strategy of patients with LA- and RM-NPC; and (2) to test if treatment individualization strategies based on pre- and on-treatment plasma EBV DNA will improve survival outcomes.

For LA-NPC, the study design consists of two components: (1) to allocate adult patients with UICC/AJCC 8th edition TNM-stage 2-4A LA-NPC to 3 treatment arms of different intensities by their plasma EBV DNA levels pre-treatment and post-induction chemotherapy (IC); and (2) to incorporate open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trials within the platform for patients who are deemed to be at high-risk of relapse, defined by a persistently detectable EBV DNA following 3 cycles of IC. Primary study end-point is 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).
