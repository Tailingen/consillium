Primary Objectives

1. To determine the safety and feasibility of intra-muscular administration of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine in patients with persistent HPV16+ ASC-US/LSIL.
2. To determine the appropriate intra-muscular injection dose of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine as determined by toxicity and immunogenicity for a subsequent phase II clinical trial.
3. To determine the safety and feasibility of intra-muscular administration of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine prime, TA-CIN protein vaccine boost in patients with persistent HPV16+ ASC-US/LSIL.
