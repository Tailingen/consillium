BEHAVIORAL: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP)
Recruitment yield of participants contacted, Study feasibility will be assessed by tracking the number of patients contacted, 12 Months|Recruitment yield of participants consented, Study feasibility will be assessed by tracking the number of participants that consent to enroll in the trial., 12 Months|Recruitment yield number of participants enrolled, Study feasibility will be assessed by recruitment yield, i.e., tracking the number of participants who initiated treatment., 12 Months|Session Attendance, Study feasibility will be assessed by tracking the number of participants attend each intervention session over the course of the 6-week intervention period., 6 Weeks|Participant Satisfaction, Study acceptability will be assessed by administering a post-intervention satisfaction survey which asks about satisfaction with the program including perceived efficacy and suggestions for improvement., 6 Weeks
Pain Intensity, Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by analyzing change in self-reported pain scores using The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System short form 3a v1.0 (PROMIS). This tool measures how much a person hurts., 6 Weeks|Opioid Use Frequency, Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by self-reported opioid use frequency weekly throughout the intervention period., 6 Weeks|Pain interference, Preliminary efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) will be assessed by analyzing pain interference using the PROMIS short form 8a. The PROMIS Pain Interference instrument measures the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life and may include the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities., 6 Weeks|Opioid Refill Frequency, Frequency of opioid refills will be assessed via pharmacy records available in patients' EMR, 6 Weeks
To assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for chronic pain (ACT-CP) in a Survivorship clinic.
