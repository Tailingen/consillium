Study of Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy of prostate cancer can achieve similar treatment benefits as our current institutional standard with conventional fractionation.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Proton Radiation|RADIATION: Proton
Number of Participants With Late Treatment-Related Toxicity Greater Than or Equal to Grade 3, CTCAE Version 4.0, To determine if late CTCAE version 4.0 Grade 3 treatment-related morbidity, which is no worse than that engendered by our current institutional standard with conventional fractionation, can be maintained in a hypofractionated schedule., Every 6 months after completing treatment through the duration of the trial with a minimum of 2 years follow-up and an average of 5 years
Number of Participants With Acute and Late Gastrointestinal or Genitourinary Grade 2 Morbidity, CTCAE Version 4.0, To determine if late CTCAE version 4.0 Grade 2 treatment-related morbidity, which is no worse than that engendered by our current institutional standard with conventional fractionation, can be maintained in a hypofractionated schedule., Every 6 months after completing treatment through the duration of the trial, with a minimum of 2 years follow-up and an average of 5 years
Radiation therapy has a long and established role in the curative treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. However, the optimal radiation dose and treatment schedule remain unknown. The use of hypofractionation has a long and generally successful history in conformal proton beam therapy. Several reports detailing the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated conformal radiation therapy (with x-rays) of prostate cancer can be found in the literature. Hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy has become our institutional routine for the treatment of numerous solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine if a shortened overall treatment schedule will result in equivalent tumor control rates and no increased side effects as compared to our current institutional standard treatment of an equivalent dose given over a longer period of time.
