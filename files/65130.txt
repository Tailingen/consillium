A Trial to Improve Quality of Life With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Patients With Painful Bone Metastases
This is a phase III randomized-controlled, single-blind study comparing the standard schedule for antalgic radiotherapy of a single fraction of 8.0 Gy delivered through three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to a single fraction of 20.0 Gy delivered through stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The primary aim of this trial is to double the complete response rate. Secondary aims are to compare general response rates, duration of pain response, acute and late toxicity, HRQoL through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), pain flare, and re-irradiation need.
Metastasis to Bone|Radiotherapy|Neoplasm Metastasis
RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy|RADIATION: 3D-conformal radiotherapy
Pain response, Pain response at the treated index site at 1 month after radiotherapy (RT), as defined by the consensus statement., 4 weeks after RT visit
Incidence of pain flare, Number of participants with increase in pain score of 2 or more above baseline at the treated site with stable OMED, or an increase of 25% or more in OMED compared with baseline with the pain score stable or 1 point above baseline, 24-48 hours after radiotherapy|Duration of pain response, Time until pain progression (defined as an increase in pain score of 2 or more above baseline at the treated site with stable daily oral morphine equivalent, or an increase of 25% or more in daily oral morphine equivalent (OMED) compared with baseline with the pain score stable or 1 point above baseline), 2 years after radiotherapy|Re-irradiation need, Need for re-irradiation of the treated lesion, 2 years after radiotherapy|Acute toxicity Measured with CTCAE version 5.0, Measured with CTCAE version 5.0, 3 months after radiotherapy|Late toxicity Measured with CTCAE version 5.0, Measured with CTCAE version 5.0, 2 years after radiotherapy|Impact of treatment on Quality of Life: EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) BM22, Using the EORTC quality of life questionnaire for Bone Metastases (QLQ BM22) to measure impact of bone metastases on QoL \[min score 0 - max score 100\]. A high score represents a high level of symptomatology. The score is calculated by applying a linear transformation on the scores to each answer of the 22 question-long questionnaire (cfr. EORTC mannual)., 2 years after radiotherapy|Number of Subsequent Serious Skeletal events, Incidence of symptomatic pathologic fractures, radiation or surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression., 2 years after radiotherapy
