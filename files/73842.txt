Comparing Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) to Conventional and Abbreviated Breast MRI for Breast Cancer Screening
This study is looking at a breast cancer screening technique, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), as a possible alternative to the breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) used by most healthcare professionals.

The technique involved in this study is:

-Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI)
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: MRI|DEVICE: RSI
Diagnostic accuracy of breast restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) in comparison to conventional breast MRI, We will test the non-inferiority of RSI compared to DCE-MRI using ROC curves created for the BI-RADS score, based on the reader study., 2 years
Diagnostic accuracy of RSI compared to that of abbreviated MRI (Ab-MRI) in breast cancer screening, We will test the non-inferiority of RSI compared to Ab-MRI using ROC curves created for the BI-RADS score, based on the reader study., 2 years
The primary purpose of this research study is to measure RSI's ability to diagnose breast cancer in comparison to standard breast MRIs.

RSI is a technique that has been shown to address the limitations of certain types of MRI exams used to make images of the prostate and brain. RSI is not a FDA-approved technique for screening, but is a type of advanced diffusion technique and diffusion weighted imaging is used as a part of the standard breast MRI. RSI has been shown to improve tumor detection in prostate and brain. For example, a recent pilot study in prostate showed that adding RSI improved the ability to find a certain stage of prostate cancer in comparison to an MRI without the use of the RSI technique. By comparing RSI's ability to diagnose breast cancer, future clinical testing can determine whether RSI is a more efficient way to screen for breast cancer.
