A Multi-Center, Parallel Design, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 6 and 12 mg ProellexÂ® (Telapristone Acetate) Administered Orally in the Treatment of Premenopausal Women With Confirmed Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of two oral doses of Proellex administered for up to 2 courses of treatment (18 weeks each), each separated by an Off-Drug Interval (ODI), to premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Uterine Fibroids
DRUG: Telapristone Acetate|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Participants in Amenorrhea at the End of Treatment Course 1, Amenorrhea was defined as no bleeding intensity score greater than 1 using the Daily Diary Card during the 28 days leading up to the last day of dosing at Week 18. Bleeding intensity was graded on a 5-point scale where: 0=no bleeding to 4=heavy bleeding., At the end of 18-weeks Treatment Course 1
Percentage of Participants in Amenorrhea at the End of Treatment Course 2, Amenorrhea was defined as no bleeding intensity score greater than 1 using the Daily Diary Card during the 28 days leading up to the last day of dosing at Week 18. Bleeding intensity was graded on a 5-point scale where: 0=no bleeding to 4=heavy bleeding., At the end of 18-weeks Treatment Course 2|Change in Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) Score From Baseline to the End of Treatment Courses 1 and 2, ODI Course 1 and the Course 2 Week 28 Follow-up (FU) Visit, Uterine bleeding was assessed with the use of the PBAC, a validated self-reporting method to estimate menstrual blood loss. Participants recorded daily the number of tampons and towels used and the degree to which individual items were soiled with blood (plus small or large clots). Pictorial scores range from score 1 for slightly stained tampon/towel, 5 for a partially stained tampon/towel, 10 for a completely saturated tampon, 20 for a completely saturated towel, and 5 for each episode of flooding and for each blood clot larger than a quarter in size. Total score can range from 0 (no bleeding) to \>500. Higher scores indicate more bleeding. Lower scores indicate less bleeding. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement (reduction in bleeding)., Baseline (No treatment period) to the end of 18-weeks Treatment Course 1, the end of ODI Course 1, the end of 18-weeks Treatment Course 2 and the Course 2 Week 28 FU Visit|Percentage Change in PBAC Score From Baseline to the End of Treatment Courses 1 and 2, ODI Course 1 and the Course 2 Week 28 FU Visit, Uterine bleeding was assessed with the use of the PBAC, a validated self-reporting method to estimate menstrual blood loss.
