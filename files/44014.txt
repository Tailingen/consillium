Study Investigating the Role of Oxaliplatin Duration in Modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX Regimen as Adjuvant Colon Cancer Therapy
This study is designed to confirm that first 3 months of oxaliplatin in 6 months of modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment is not inferior to 6 months of oxaliplatin in modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment in terms of disease free survival in patients with stage II/III colon cancer.
Colon Cancer
DRUG: oxaliplatin
disease-free survival, 3 years
overall survival, 3 years|quality of life, 3 years|safety profiles, Safety will be assessed on the basis of an analysis of adverse events, standard clinical chemistry and hematology findings. Clinical and laboratory toxicities/symptoms will be graded according to the CTCAE 3.0. Adverse events which are not reported in CTCAE 3.0 will be graded as mild, moderate, severe or life threatening., 3 years
This study is designed to confirm that first 3 months of oxaliplatin in 6 months of modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment is not inferior to 6 months of oxaliplatin in modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment in terms of disease free survival in patients with stage II/III colon cancer. In addition, we would like to characterize pharmacogenomic profile associated with toxicities and gene expression profiling to predict the recurrence of colon cancer as parallel study.
