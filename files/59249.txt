Dose Escalated Proton Beam Therapy or Photon Therapy for Esophageal Cancer
This study will evaluate if proton beam therapy as part of chemoradiation results in a decrease in diffusion lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) compared to photon radiation therapy for esophageal carcinoma. A secondary objective is to determine effects on cardiac function, quality of life, and compare acute and late toxicities.
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: Proton Beam Therapy|RADIATION: Photon Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Compare the rate of a clinically significant reduction of DLCO (defined as a decrease of â‰¥ 10% from baseline) between protons and photons after preoperative or definitive chemoradiation, Participants with a clinically significant reduction of DLCO approximately 12 months after radiation therapy, Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy
Compare quality of life, Participants quality of life results using EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Oesophageal Cancer Module (OES-18) and EORTC QLQ C-30 conjointly approximately 12 months after radiation therapy, Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy|Compare outcomes for local control, Number of participants with local control for proton and photon radiation and concurrent chemotherapy as part of definitive therapy or trimodality therapy approximately 12 months after radiation therapy, Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy|Compare outcomes for progression free survival, Number of participants with progression free survival for proton and photon radiation and concurrent chemotherapy as part of definitive therapy or trimodality therapy approximately 12 months after radiation therapy, Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy|Compare overall survival rates, Number of participants with overall survival rates for proton and photon radiation and concurrent chemotherapy as part of definitive therapy or trimodality therapy approximately 12 months after radiation therapy, Approximately 12 months after radiation therapy
Radiation Modality: Proton radiotherapy will be offered to all patients that meet trial eligibility. If patients decline proton radiotherapy or are otherwise unable to receive proton therapy they will be included in x-ray cohort (group 2).

Chemotherapy will be delivered at the discretion of the treating Medical Oncologist. Weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel at standard doses is preferred. It is recommended that the weekly chemotherapy regimen be continued throughout the course of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy should begin within 48 hours of beginning radiotherapy.
