AK112 and AK104 With or Without Chemotherapy in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial is a Phase Ib/II study. All patients are stage IIIB/C (unsuitable for radical therapy) or IV non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AK112 and AK104 with or without chemotherapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC.
