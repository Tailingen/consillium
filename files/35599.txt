Glofitamab Bridging ASCT for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory DLBCL
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Glofitamab bridging ASCT regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to provide better clinical benefits to these patients.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma(DLBCL)
DRUG: Group Aï¼šPatients with PR or ctDNA positivity after salvage treatment|PROCEDURE: Group B: Patients with CR and ctDNA negative after salvage treatment|DRUG: Group C: Patients with SD/PD after posterior treatment
Overall response rate(ORR), The rate of patients who achieved CR or PR after treatment with Glofitamab bridging ASCT Regimen, Up to 1-month after treatment with Glofitamab bridging ASCT Regimen|Complete remission rate(CRR), The rate of patients who achieved CR after treatment with Glofitamab bridging ASCT Regimen, Up to 1-month after treatment with Glofitamab bridging ASCT Regimen
Main adverse reactions, The safety and tolerability of the therapeutic regimen measured by the major adverse events., Start from the first day of Immunotargeted therapy to 1 month after treatment with Glofitamab bridging ASCT Regimen|Overal survival(OS), OS will be assessed from the first day of Immunotargeted therapy to date of death or end of follow-up., Up to 24 months after the end of last patients' treatment|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS will be assessed from the first day of Immunotargeted therapy to date of progression, relapse, death or end of follow-up., Up to 24 months after the end of last patients' treatment|Overall response rate(ORR), The rate of patients who achieved CR or PR after Immunotargeted treatment, up to 3-week after treatment with Immunotargeted therapy|Complete remission rate(CRR), The rate of patients who achieved CR or PR after Immunotargeted treatment, up to 3-week after treatment with Immunotargeted therapy
This study seeks to include patients aged 18 to 70 years with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL) who have undergone at least a second-line systemic treatment, excluding those with prior resistance to Glofitamab. Based on their disease status following the second-line treatment, participants will be categorized into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A will consist of patients who exhibit partial response (PR) or are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive after second-line treatment and are planning to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or Glofitamab as a bridging therapy to ASCT. Group B will include patients who achieve complete response (CR) and are ctDNA negative post-second-line treatment, and they will receive ASCT as consolidation therapy. Patients in Group B who achieved CR and were ctDNA negative following second-line treatment will proceed directly to ASCT consolidation therapy. In Group C, patients who exhibited stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) after second-line treatment were reassessed following two cycles of Glofitamab. Those who attained PR subsequently underwent ASCT consolidation therapy, whereas patients achieving CR had the option to either undergo ASCT or continue with Glofitamab maintenance therapy. Patients with SD or PD were excluded from the study. Patients exhibiting SD or PD were excluded from the cohort. Individuals who have successfully undergone autologous transplantation and subsequent maintenance therapy with Glofitamab will be monitored for assessments of efficacy and survival outcomes.
