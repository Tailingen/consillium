Effects of Different Oxygen Concentrations on Pulmonary Complications in Patients Undergoing Radical Resection of Esophageal Cancer
Radical operation of esophageal cancer is complicated and traumatic, and ventilation with one lung in lateral position and ventilation with both lungs after supine position requires long-term tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation, and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is high.
Atelectasis, Postoperative
DRUG: 30%Oxygen|DRUG: 60%Oxygen
the occurrence of atelectasis, The primary outcome is the occurrence of atelectasis scanned by computerized tomography in the operating room within 40 minutes after awakening, On the operating room within 40 minutes after awakening
oxygenation index, The secondary outcome is the comparison of the oxygenation index between the two groups, which is calculated and compared from the results of intraoperative blood gas analysis, On the operating room within 40 minutes after awakening
Therefore, we should explore the most appropriate lung protection ventilation strategy to reduce the occurrence of pulmonary complications. The recommended standard of international expert group on lung protective ventilation strategy points out that the lowest concentration of oxygen (≤40%) should be inhaled as much as possible during mechanical ventilation to maintain normal blood oxygen level (SpO2≥94%). If the mixed gas with low inhaled oxygen concentration can achieve ideal oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen partial pressure, it may reduce the postoperative pulmonary complications of the subjects. However, there are few reports on the influence of different oxygen concentrations on pulmonary complications in patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer. This study intends to explore the influence of different oxygen concentrations on pulmonary complications in patients undergoing radical resection of esophageal cancer.
