Injection of Lymphocytes From Haplo-identical Donor Following Chemotherapy in Patients With High-risk Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia Not Eligible for an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Patients with high risk AML non eligible for an intensive treatment and for an allogeneic transplantation will be treated with azacitidine and venetoclax. The fourth, fifth and sixth injection of azacitidine will be followed by injection of haplo-identical lymphocytes (HLI). This is a single-center phase I study to identify the dose of HLI with the most tolerable toxicity. TheBayesian continuous reassessment method (CRM) will be used
