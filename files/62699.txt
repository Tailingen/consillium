Clinical Study of Personalized mRNA Vaccine Encoding Neoantigen Alone in Subjects With Advanced Digestive System Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of personalized mRNA vaccine iNeo-Vac-R01 alone in subjects with advanced digestive system neoplasms.
Digestive System Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: iNeo-Vac-R01
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) [safety and tolerability], 21 days after last iNeo-Vac-R01 dose|Proportion of Subjects Receiving iNeo-Vac-R01 Injection Treatment to Enrolled Subjects [feasibility], 21 days after last iNeo-Vac-R01 dose|Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Level 3 or 4 AEs related to iNeo-Vac-R01 injection., 28 days (+/-3 days) after first iNeo-Vac-R01 dose
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time between the date of the first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01 and the date of death due to any cause., 3 years after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) to all subjects based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., 3 years after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as proportion of subjects with reduced or stable neoplasms that have been maintained for a certain period of time, including the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, and stable disease (SD)., 3 years after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from first PR or CR until either disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., 3 years after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Part A and Part B: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time between the date of first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01 and the date of either disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., 3 years after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Neoantigen-specific T Cell Response [immunogenicity], Detect the level of specific TNF-γ in peripheral blood of subjects by ELISpot in order to measure the neoantigen-specific T cell response of subjects., 12 months after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|T Cell Subsets [immunogenicity], Detect the proportion of different T cell subsets in T cells by flow cytometry., 12 months after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01|Cytokines Level [immunogenicity], Record the changes of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α in peripheral blood before and after treatment., 6 months after first dose of iNeo-Vac-R01
This is a multi-part single-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study of personalized mRNA vaccine iNeo-Vac-R01 monotherapy in subjects with advanced digestive system neoplasms. The study will include a dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. The traditional 3+3 design will be used in dose escalation.
