A Storage Facility for Tissues Obtained From Patients With Malignant Melanoma
This study collects and stores blood and tumor samples from patients with malignant melanoma and healthy individuals. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the causes of melanoma and how melanoma tumors behave. Storing blood and tumor samples for future research may lead to new discoveries that may ultimately help with diagnosing or treating this disease.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
New prognostic markers in malignant melanoma, Facilitate studies aimed at investigating new prognostic markers and potentially therapeutic therapies in malignant melanoma. . Draws conducted at baseline prior to immune therapy, four weeks after draw 1 and prior to the third cycle., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Facilitate studies aimed at investigating new prognostic markers and potentially therapeutic therapies in malignant melanoma.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of blood samples at the time of the initial diagnostic work-up, and possibly prior to the initiation of surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy, at tumor progression or recurrence, and annually during routine follow-up (no more than 4 blood draws per year). Patients may also undergo collection of tissue sample during standard of care surgical or radiologic procedures. Healthy individuals undergo collection of blood samples up to 4 times over 1 year.
