Combination of Ipi/Nivo Plus Sacituzumab Govitecan in Metastatic Cisplatin Ineligible Urothelial Carcinoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to see how well the study drugs called Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab (IPI-NIVO) work when added to another study drug called Sacituzumab Govitecan for people who have metastatic bladder cancer.
Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Sacituzumab govitecan
Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/ Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Sacituzumab Govitecan when combined with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab, Up to 12 months|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Sacituzumab Govitecan with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab combination. ORR is defined as the rate of the best overall response as complete response (CR) or partial response (CR). OR will be summarized by the percentage of responses with a 95% confidence interval as calculated from Clopper-Pearson method., Up to 30 months
Phase 1: Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate is defined as the rate of the best overall response as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to 12 months|Phase 1: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response will be calculated as the date of the first evaluation showing documented response, partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), to the date of the first progressive disease (PD) or death., Up to 12 months|Phase 1: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival defined as the time from start of treatment to the first event of death or progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 12 months|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival defined as the time from start of treatment to the first event of death or progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 12 months|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response will be calculated as the date of the first evaluation showing documented response, partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), to the date of the first progressive disease (PD) or death., Up to 12 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival defined as the length of time from start of treatment until death by any cause. Participants will be evaluated using Kaplan- Meier estimation for survival for up to 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment; patients surviving longer than 6 months will be censored., Up to 12 months
The phase I component of this study will evaluate fixed doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab (3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively) IV every 3 weeks x 4 cycles combined with a starting dose of sacituzumab govitecan Level 1 of 8 mg/kg IV days 1,8 every 3 weeks (1 cycle) x 4 cycles. One dose escalation to 10 mg/kg and one dose reduction to dose level minus 1 of sacituzumab govitecan 6 mg/kg days 1,8 every 3 weeks is allowed.

The phase II component will be conducted as two-stage trial enrolling 34 patients with a futility interim analysis after stage 1 (13 patients). After 4 cycles, patients will continue maintenance nivolumab 360 mg IV every Q 21 days along with RP2 dose of SG D1,8 Q21 days till progression of disease or intolerable toxicities or patient decision. Radiographic imaging is performed every 12 weeks to assess response.
