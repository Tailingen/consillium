Evaluation of an Online, Remote Cognitive Battery for Use in Cancer Survivorship
The purpose of this study is to measure changes in cognitive (mental) function in cancer survivors using a brief, reliable, game-like set of tests that can be completed outside the clinic, as an alternative to traditional neurocognitive assessments. This set of computerized tests, the Cogsuite Assessment, is expected to improve our ability to identify cognitive impairments in people who have been treated for cancer, so that we can (1) learn more about which cognitive functions are affected by cancer treatment, and (2) guide that treatment more effectively.
