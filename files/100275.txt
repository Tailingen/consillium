Mechanisms for Laser-Induced Rejuvenation
It has shown that laser wounding of geriatric skin protects it against skin cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the origin of cells called fibroblasts which are present after treatment with Fractionated Laser Resurfacing (FLR). These cells restore a youth-like ultraviolet B (UVB) response, but where they come from is currently unknown. The study recruits subjects who are scheduled to undergo abdominoplasties to investigate the origin of those cells stimulated by laser treatment.
Skin Cancer
DEVICE: Fractionated Laser Resurfacing
To test if the new fibroblasts that develop in response to fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) wounding are derived from blood-derived monocytes., Identify cells in the skin that have been wounded by FLR at 2 weeks and 1 week previously, for cells that co-express markers for both fibroblasts and monocytes by using single cell RNA-sequencing, 2 weeks prior to skin removal and 1 week prior to skin removal|To test if possible cells transitioning from monocytes to fibroblasts are found in the top part of the dermis (papillary dermis)., Using tissue RNA-seq, PI will define if co-expressing cells are in the papillary dermis., 2 weeks prior to skin removal and 1 week prior to skin removal
To define the number and types of cells populating the skin following fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) wounding, Define the number and types of cells following FLR wounding at 2 weeks and 1 week prior to skin removal by using single-cell RNA-seq., 2 weeks prior to skin removal and 1 week prior to skin removal|To define the locations of the number of cells populating in the skin following fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) wounding, Define the locations of the number cell following FLR wounding at 2 weeks and 1 week prior to skin removal by using tissue RNA-seq., 2 weeks prior to skin removal and 1 week prior to skin removal|To define the locations of the types of cells populating in the skin following fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) wounding, Define the locations of the different cell types following FLR wounding at 2 weeks and 1 week prior to skin removal by using tissue RNA-seq., 2 weeks prior to skin removal and 1 week prior to skin removal
