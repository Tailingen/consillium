Phase 1 Study of UCMYM802 Injection in Mesothelin-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of UCMYM802 (Circular mRNA encoding Anti-Mesothelin CAR-T) injection in patients with Mesothelin-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.
