Inflammatory Response After One-lung Ventilation According to Ventilation Methods
Unlike conventional thoracic surgery performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, non-intubated thoracic surgery with sedation and regional anesthesia has been performed recently. Non-intubated thoracic surgery is expected to reduce the postoperative inflammatory changes by maintaining more physiologic status during the operation compared to intubated thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to compare perioperative immunological changes between intubated and non-intubated thoracic surgery.
