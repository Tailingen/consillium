Tailored Sonidegib Schedule After Complete Response in BCC
Adult patients with locally advanced BCC, not amenable to surgical treatment and who obtained a complete response (CR) to Hedgehog inhibitors are administered a tailored schedule of the study drug. The tailored schedule consists of a change in the time of drug assumption. It implements some weeks of assumption and some weeks of suspension of sonidegib rather than a continuous administration.
