Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Oncolytic Adenovirus L-IFN Injection in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors Clinical Study
This is an open-label, dose escalation study of the safety and tolerability of Recombinant oncolytic adenovirus L-IFN injection（YSCH-01） when administered via intratumoral injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injectionand to determine the recommended phase 1 dose for further study. The study will also evaluate antitumor activity, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injection

DRUG: Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injection
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injection in humans with malignant tumors., Up to 28 days|Safety and tolerability assessed by Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP, Time Frame: Up to 6 months
Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and /or adverse event, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values, Up to 6 months|Number of participants with laboratory value abnormalities and/or adverse events, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values, Up to 6 months|Presence of neutralizing antibodies of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) development, To evaluate the immunogenicity of Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injection given as single agent post injection, Up to 6 months
This is an investigator initiated , open-label, study of Recombinant oncolytic adenovirus L-IFN injection given via intratumoral (IT) injection as a single agent in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study is a single agent dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of Recombinant L-IFN adenovirus injection. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately19-28 evaluable participants enrolled.

The primary study objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of Recombinant oncolytic adenovirus L-IFN injection as a single agent. Secondary objectives will assess efficacy overall response rate, as well as disease control rate, progression free survival, duration of response, and anti-tumor immune responses.
