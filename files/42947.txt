LIpitor and biGuanide to Androgen Delay Trial
This study is a randomized trial examining the administration of a combination of biguanide metformin and atorvastatin ("Lipitor") to men who are experiencing rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, despite having undergone radical therapy (surgery and/or radiation).
