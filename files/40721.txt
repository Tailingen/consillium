Influence of Ketoconazole on the Pharmacokinetics of Romidepsin in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of multiple doses of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin after a single intravenous (IV) infusion.
Hematologic Malignancy|Malignant Lymphoma
DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: Ketoconazole
Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t)of Romidepsin, AUC0-t: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (Ct), calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing. For AUC0-t, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to estimate the ratio of geometric means and its 90% CI between romidepsin alone and romidepsin in the presence to ketoconazole., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose) 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time 0 to 24-hour (AUC 0-24), AUC 0-24: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 to 24 hours, calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing; for AUC 0-24 an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to estimate the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence interval (CI) between romidepsin alone and romidepsin in the presence of ketoconazole, Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-∞), AUC0-∞: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 extrapolated to infinity, calculated as \[AUCt + Ct/λz\]., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax: maximum observed plasma concentration, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data; for Cmax, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to estimate the ratio of geometric means and its 90% confidence interval (CI) between romidepsin alone and romidepsin in the presence of ketoconazole, Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Tmax: time to maximum observed Tmax, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data, Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Estimate of the Terminal Elimination Half-life in Plasma (t1/2), Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) in plasma, was calculated as \[(ln 2)/λz\], Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose),1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Apparent Total Plasma Clearance (CL), Apparent total plasma clearance, (CL) calculated as \[Dose/AUC 0-∞\]., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Apparent Total Volume of Distribution (Vz), Vz: apparent total volume of distribution, calculated as \[(CL)/λz\]., Days 1 and 8, At 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.
Summary of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), All 15 subjects in the safety population received at least 1 dose of romidepsin. AEs were considered related if assessed by the Investigator as possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug. Serious AEs (SAEs) are those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., Day 1 up to Day 36 (28 days after last treatment)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of multiple doses of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin after a single intravenous (IV) infusion.
