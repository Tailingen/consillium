A Trial of ZD6474, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery
The purpose of the study is to determine the most tolerable and safe dose of ZD6474 (Zactima, Vandetanib) when given with standard chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery in patients with cancer of the esophagus
Cancer of the Esophagus|Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Cancer of the Stomach
DRUG: Vandetanib|DRUG: 5 Fluorouracil (FU)|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation Therapy (RT)
Maximum Tolerated Dose of Vandetanib, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vandetanib given concurrently with chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by surgery (esophagectomy)evaluated by the frequency, severity and duration of adverse events that occur during treatment and for four weeks following surgery as measured by serial blood tests, electrocardiograms and physical assessments, Within 4 weeks of initiation of chemo/radiation therapy
The Number of Participants With Adverse Events, To determine the safety and tolerability of Vandetanib when given in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy as evaluated by serial blood tests, electrocardiograms, and physical assessments during therapy and for four weeks following surgery, Within 4 weeks of initiation of chemo/radiation therapy
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is known to be an important prognostic factor for patients with esophageal cancer-overexpression is associated with a worse prognosis. Review of the literature demonstrates presence of EGFR expression in up 90% of cases of esophageal cancer. Additionally, Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF) is commonly overexpressed in esophageal cancer (especially adenocarcinoma) and is linked to the transition from Barrett's esophagus to invasive adenocarcinoma. Esophageal cancers with overexpression of VEGF are associated with a worse prognosis and poorer response to conventional chemoradiation.

Therefore, we feel it would be valuable to add an inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR to the therapy of esophageal cancer to increase the rate of pathologic complete response and thus improve overall survival. In current trials of ZD6474 in combination with chemotherapy, the dose has been 300mg. We will perform a phase I trial in which we will dose-escalate ZD6474 to determine if this drug is tolerable in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. This would be the first trial in humans in which f these three modalities would be combined. We will determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZD6474 in this small trial and then hope to perform a larger phase II trial, perhaps in the context of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG).
