The Norwegian Immunotherapy in Multiple Myeloma Study
The goal of this observational study is to study the effectiveness and complications of novel immunotherapies used in the treatment of multiple myeloma in routine care in Norway. The aim is to close knowledge gaps, generate evidence for future clinical trials and contribute to future consensus on how to monitor for adverse events, and what mitigation strategies should be implemented, so that we can increase patient survival and quality-of-life.
