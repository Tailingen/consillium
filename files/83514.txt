Enthesitis Assessment Before and After Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Treatment in Spondyloarthritis
Biological therapies should be considered in patients with high disease activity despite nonsteroid antiinflammatory drug treatment. The first option among biological therapies is anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) drugs. In recent years, anti-TNF treatments have shown that clinical and ultrasonographic enthesitis may improve as well as disease activity, quality of life and acute phase reactants. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation of enthesitis and to determine its response to anti-TNF treatment in patients with SpA.In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation of enthesitis and to determine its response to anti-TNF treatment in patients with SpA.
