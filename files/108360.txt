68Ga-NY104 PET/CT in Patients With Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, comparative phase 2 study in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The goal is to determine the sensitivity of 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma and compare it with 18F-FDG PET/CT.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT
Positivity of lesions detected by 68Ga-NY104 PET, Any focal accumulation that cannot be explained by physiologic uptake of the 68Ga-NY104 will be interpreted as focal lesion., From study completion to 1 month after completion|Positivity of lesions detected by 18F-FDG PET, Any focal accumulation that cannot be explained by physiologic uptake of 18F-FDG will be interpreted as focal lesion., From study completion to 1 month after completion
SUVmax of lesions detected by 68Ga-NY104 PET, The tracer uptake in focal lesions is quantified using maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) by drawing a 3-dimentional region of interest (ROI) over the lesion using a threshold of 40% SUVmax., From study completion to 1 month after completion|SUVmax of lesions detected by 18F-FDG PET, The tracer uptake in focal lesions is quantified using maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) by drawing a 3-dimentional region of interest (ROI) over the lesion using a threshold of 40% SUVmax., From study completion to 1 month after completion
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, comparative phase 2 study in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Each patient will receive one dose of 68Ga-NY104 and one dose of 18F-FDG by intravenous route. Dedicated whole-body PET/CT imaging will be performed. PET/CT studies will be interpreted by two readers, both of whom will provide independent, blinded interpretations. Imaging interpretations and a composite reference standard will be used to estimate the sensitivity of each modality. The tumor uptake will also be compared for matched lesions.

39 patients will be recruited in Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
