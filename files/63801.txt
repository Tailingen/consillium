Study of Risk Factors for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms Degeneration at the Nancy CHRU (IPMN)
Cystic lesions of the pancreas are frequent with a risk of degeneration into adenocarcinoma with pejorative prognosis.

IPMNs require characterization to clarify their potential for degeneration. Clinical and morphological risk factors for degeneration determine the monitoring rate and the indication for pancreatic surgery.

Pancreatic surgery remains invasive with high morbidity and mortality rates.
Study of Risk Factors for IPMNs Degeneration at the Nancy CHRU
BEHAVIORAL: Sensitivity and specificity of risk factors for degeneration of IPMNs
High-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer, High-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer on histological analysis of the surgical specimen, 12 years
This is a monoservice and monocentric retrospective study at the Nancy CHRU. We will study the risk factors for IPMNs degeneration in order to determine the most sensitive and specific.

To do this, we will use high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer on the histological analysis of surgical specimens as the primary endpoint.

The study population will be patients with Branch Duct, Main Duct or mixed IPMNs operated at the Nancy CHRU between September 2009 and October 2021.
