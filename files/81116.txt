Post-transplant Flotetuzumab for AML
The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug, flotetuzumab, is safe and tolerable when given to participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has relapsed after transplant.

Despite significant advances, the prognosis for patients with AML remains poor with 5-year overall survival of just \~40% in younger patients and much poorer long-term survival in older patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT) as post-remission therapy has led to improved overall survival when compared to consolidation chemotherapy for the vast majority of AML patients who have intermediate or poor risk cytogenetics. Due to significant transplant-related mortality (TRM) and poor outcomes in older patients with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) transplantation, there have been many studies investigating the feasibility of less intensive conditioning regimens such as reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA), which have shown comparable overall survival with decreased TRM but an increased risk of relapse. As these less intensive conditioning strategies become more widely adopted, the need to focus on the identification and treatment of AML patients at risk for post-transplant relapse increases. Maintenance therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies have proven safe and effective across a range of diseases including AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are another potential target for post-transplant therapy, and the expression of CD123 readily discriminates AML LSCs from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody CSL360 has previously demonstrated efficacy in post-transplant patients with relapsed disease, while flotetuzumab has demonstrated efficacy in relapsed and refractory patients. Given this preliminary data, the investigators propose a trial of flotetuzumab as post-alloHSCT therapy for AML in patients with evidence of disease post-transplant including frank relapse. The investigators believe that treatment with flotetuzumab in this setting will be well tolerated and effective. Flotetuzumab is not approved for use in people with AML. Its use has not been specifically studied in patients with AML following a bone marrow transplant and therefore its use in this study is investigational.
