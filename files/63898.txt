Infusion of Panobinostat (MTX110) Into the Fourth Ventricle in Children and Adults with Recurrent Medulloblastoma
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of infusions of panobinostat (MTX110) into the fourth ventricle of the brain or tumor resection cavity in patients with recurrent medulloblastoma and to assess the antitumor activity of simultaneous infusions of panobinostat (MTX110) into the fourth ventricle of the brain or resection cavity in patients with recurrent medulloblastoma based upon MRI scans and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.
