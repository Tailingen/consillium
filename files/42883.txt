A Study on Adding Precisely Targeted Radiation Therapy (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) to the Usual Treatment Approach (Drug Therapy) in People With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if using Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy/SBRT to treat a single metastatic site where cancer has worsened may be an effective treatment for people with oligometastatic breast cancer. Participants will stay on their usual drug therapy while they receive SBRT. This combination of SBRT to a single metastatic site and usual drug therapy may prevent participants' cancer from worsening in other metastatic sites or spreading.

Progression free survival, The primary objective is to assess progression free survival, defined as systemic progression or death, within 3 months from start of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy/SBRT delivery., 3 months from start of SBRT delivery
