Biological Therapy in Treating Patients at High-Risk or With Lymphoma, Lymphoproliferative Disease, or Malignancies
The purpose of this phase I/II trial is to study the side effects and best dose of biological therapy to treat patients at high-risk or with Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease.
EBV-induced Lymphomas|EBV-associated Malignancies|Transplant Patients With EBV Viremia at High Risk of Developing a Recurrent EBV Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as percentage of participants with best overall response of complete remission/response (CR) or partial remission/response (PR) based on investigator's assessment. For participants with clinically and/or radiologically evident EBV LPD or malignancies, CR is complete resolution of all clinical and radiologic evidence of lymphoma, confirmed by biopsy of the affected tissues when indicated, lasting for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel; and PR is a 50 % or greater reduction in the size of all lymphomatous lesions as determined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of tumor volume, which was maintained for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel. For participants without clinically and/or radiologically evident tumors with increasing levels of EBV DNA, CR is clearance of EBV without subsequent development of EBV+ LPD; and PR is at least a 10-fold decrease in EBV DNA levels., From Day 1 through 251.1 months after Day 1 dose
Overall Survival (OS), The OS is defined as the time from the first dose of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs to the date of death due to any cause. The OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through 251.1 months after Day 1 dose|OS Rate at 12 Months, Percentage of participants with OS at 12 months are reported. The OS is defined as the time from the first dose of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs to the date of death due to any cause. The OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through 12 months after Day 1 dose|OS Follow-up Time, The OS at follow-up time are reported. The OS is defined as the time from the first dose of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs to the date of death due to any cause. The OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through 251.1 months after Day 1 dose|Time to Response (TTR), The TTR was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs to the date of a PR or CR, whichever occurred first. For participants with clinically and/or radiologically evident EBV LPD or malignancies, CR was defined as complete resolution of all clinical and radiologic evidence of lymphoma, confirmed by biopsy of the affected tissues when indicated, lasting for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs; and a PR was defined as a 50 % or greater reduction in the size of all lymphomatous lesions as determined by CT or MRI scan measurements of tumor volume, which was maintained for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs. For participants without clinically and/or radiologically evident tumors with increasing levels of EBV DNA, CR was defined as clearance of EBV without subsequent development of EBV+ LPD; and PR was defined as at least a 10-fold decrease in EBV DNA levels., From Day 1 through 251.1 months after Day 1 dose|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The CBR was the proportion of participants who have achieved a CR, PR or SD assessed at least 28 days after first dose date of study drug. For participants with clinically and/or radiologically evident EBV LPD or malignancies, CR as complete resolution of all clinical and radiologic evidence of lymphoma, confirmed by biopsy of affected tissues when indicated, lasting for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel or EBVCTLs; and a PR as a \>= 50% reduction in size of all lymphomatous lesions as determined by CT or MRI scan measurements of tumor volume, maintained for at least 3 weeks following completion of a cycle of tabelecleucel or EBV-CTLs. For participants without clinically and/or radiologically evident tumors with increasing levels of EBV DNA, CR as clearance of EBV without subsequent development of EBV+ LPD; and PR as at least a 10-fold decrease in EBV DNA levels. The CBR was included specifically as clinically meaningful for solid tumor, namely LMS., From Day 1 through 251.1 months after Day 1 dose
The purpose of this phase I/II trial is to study the side effects and best dose of biological therapy to treat patients at high-risk or with Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease.
