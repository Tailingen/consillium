Selective Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Vs Complete Axillary Dissection: A Randomised Clinical Trial to Assess the Prevention of Lymphedema in Breast Cancer Treatment
This is a pilot study at the National Cancer Institute (INT) of Milan evaluated the feasibility of selective axillary dissection (SAD) which preserved the lymphatic drainage of the arm. Lymph nodes draining the arm are identified following radiotracer injection and lymphoscintigraphy, a technique called axillary reverse mapping (ARM). SAD was found feasible in 75% of patients. Furthermore only 9% had BCRL after SAD compared to 33% after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: SELECTIVE AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION (SAD)|PROCEDURE: COMPLETE AXILLARY DISSECTION (ALND)
To compare the occurrence of breast-cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) after selective axillary dissection (SAD) and after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), For this purpose patients enrolled will receive a physical assessment one month after surgery, with evaluation at 6 and 12 months after surgery that includes oncological assessment, physical assessment, lymphoscintigraphy, and self-evaluation questionnaire to assess the presence BCRL., 36 months
Safety of the selective axillary dissection (SAD) procedure by assessing the occurrence of axillary relapses during follow-up due to incomplete resection of axillary lymph nodes., to assess the potential for residual disease in the axilla after SAD by evaluating the status, in the ALND arm, of nodes that are spared and assess the occurrence of axillary relapses during follow-up due to incomplete resection of axillary lymph nodes., 36 months
To compare costs in the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and selective axillary dissection (SAD) arms, To compare costs in the ALND and SAD arms including: lymphoscintigraphy, time required for surgery, and treatments required for lymphedema during follow up., 36 months
To evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost reduction of SAD compared to standard ALND, we propose a prospective 2-arm randomised trial. The control arm consists of patients randomized to ALND, the study arm consists of patients randomized to SAD.
