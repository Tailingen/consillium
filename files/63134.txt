A Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety and Tolerability Study of CERC-006 in Adults With Complex Lymphatic Malformations
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CERC-006 in adults (aged 18-31 years) with active, moderate to severe complex lymphatic malformations.
Lymphatic Malformation
DRUG: CERC-006
Safety and Tolerability of CERC-006 in Adults (Aged 18-31 Years) with Active, Moderate to Severe Complex Lymphatic Malformations, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by incidence of adverse events (AEs). Clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, ocular exams, cardiology tests including echocardiogram (ECHO) and electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory results will be recorded as AEs., Up to approximately 6 weeks
Serum Concentrations of CERC-006, Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)|Change from Baseline in Levels of mTOR Related Pathway Biomarkers, Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)|Change from baseline to end of treatment in radiologic assessment, if clinically indicated and/or clinical signs/symptoms of disease, Radiologic disease assessment will be done if clinically indicated, at the discretion of the investigator., Baseline (Screening) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 8 weeks)|Change from Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score, SF-36 score will measure eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. Scores on each scale will be directly transformed into a 0-100 scale, where a lower score indicates more disability., Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)|Change from Baseline in Karnofsky Performance Status Score, Karnofsky Performance Status score will be measured on a scale from 0 percent (%) to 100%, where a lower percentage score indicates a worse disease state., Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)|Change from Baseline in Pain Scale Assessment, Pain scale assessment will be done using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from no pain (0 mm) to extreme pain (100 mm)., Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CERC-006 in adults (aged 18-31 years) with active, moderate to severe complex lymphatic malformations.
