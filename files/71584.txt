On-demand PPI Therapy is Effective on Controlling Symptoms in Patients With Barrett's Esophagus.
On-demand PPI therapy is feasible for the long-term treatment of patients with Barrett's esophagus.
Barrett Esophagus|Proton Pump Inhibitor|Symptom|Reflux

Rates of progression, remaining unchanged, or regression of the distal esophageal metaplastic mucosa in both groups after 48 weeks, Progression, stationary, regression, 48 weeks.|Total symptom day, Days with reflux symptoms, 48 weeks|Number of tablets consumed, PPI tablets consumed during follow-up, 48 weeks
Consecutive patients with symptomatic Barrett's esophagus are recruited and receive biopsy for esophageal metaplastic mucosa and gastric mucosa over the antrum and body during endoscopy on enrollment. The biopsy protocol for esophageal metaplastic mucosa is following Seattle protocol. GERD Q score will be conducted on enrollment. Additionally, blood sampling for CYP2C19 genotyping is also conducted on enrollment. The eligible subjects will be treated by 8-week esomeprazole, and are then randomly assigned to receive either maintenance or on-demand esomeprazole therapy (40 mg q.d.) for 40 weeks. The patients were asked to come back every four weeks for the recording of symptom days and PPI tablet consumption numbers. Follow-up endoscopy with biopsy for esophageal and gastric mucosa is performed at the end of the 48th weeks. We will compare the effects of maintenance and on-demand PPI therapy on (1) histological changes of esophageal metaplastic mucosa (2) symptom control (3) tablet consumption number
