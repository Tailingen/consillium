Meclofenamate in Subjects With Recurrent or Progressive Brain Metastasis From Solid Tumor Primary
Cancer that has spread to the brain, or brain metastasis, is difficult to treat. Meclofenamate is a drug which has been shown to reduce brain metastasis growth in the laboratory. This medicine has been used in the past to treat pain. But, in this study, it will be used to prevent new brain metastasis. This is the first time that meclofenamate will be used in patients with brain metastasis.

This is a pilot study which means that the purpose of this study is to determine if a larger clinical trial of meclofenamate is possible in patients with brain metastasis. This study also aims to find out what effects, good and/or bad meclofenamate has on the patient and the cancer that has spread to the brain. The investigators also want to learn more about potential effects that this drug may have in the digestive system.
