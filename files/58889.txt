Ixabepilone is a FDA approved drug for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer after failure of chemotherapy. SBRT is a treatment method to deliver a high dose of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single dose or a small number of treatments with a high degree of precision within the body. The combination of Ixabepilone with SBRT is not an approved treatment at this time.
