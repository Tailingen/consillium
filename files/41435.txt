A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of AT13387, Alone or in Combination With Imatinib, in Patients With GIST
The purpose of this study is to investigate if an investigational drug called AT13387 is active against Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) that is resistant to other treatments, and to understand more about the safety of AT13387.

Most subjects in the study will receive AT13387 along with another drug called imatinib (Gleevec). Imatinib is a standard (approved) drug for treating patients with GIST. Some patients may receive AT13387 on its own. As a result, we shall begin to understand the effects of AT13387 given on its own and when combined with imatinib.We shall also find out more about the side-effects of AT13387, and more about how the body breaks down (metabolizes) AT13387.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: AT13387 and Imatinib
Rate of reduction/stabilisation of tumour size at 4 months according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, 4 months
Rate of reduction/stabilisation of tumour size at 6 months (6-month 'disease control rate' [DCR]), determined according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., 6 months|Progression-free survival at 6 months, and estimated proportion of patients surviving at 6 months., 6 months|Objective responses, using RECIST version 1.1 criteria, 6 months|Changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers assessed in tumour biopsies and plasma samples, and changes in tumour metabolism by Fludeoxyglucose - Positron emission tomography scans (FDG-PET)., 6 months|Relationships between KIT and PDGRFA tumour mutational status, changes in tumour dimensions, and exploratory pharmacodynamic biomarkers., 6 months|Pharmacokinetic profile of AT13387 given in combination with imatinib., 6 months|Treatment emergent adverse events, classified by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03., 6 months
The study consists of 3 parts: Part 1 is a dose escalation phase, Part 2 is a dose expansion phase and Part 3 is either a further dose expansion phase or a randomised phase in which half the patients receive AT13387 monotherapy and half continue to receive AT13387 in combination with imatinib.

All patients will receive AT13387 given by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Most patients will also receive imatinib 400 mg by mouth every day.

Patients will have tumour imaging at baseline, and at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then at 2 month intervals until cycle 12, and then 3-monthly thereafter.

Blood samples will be taken to measure plasma drug levels of AT13387 given in combination with imatinib
