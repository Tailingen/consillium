A Study of Gene-edited GC203 TIL on the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of gene-edited tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (GC203 TIL) therapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Gene-edited TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA lymphodepletion treatment with hydroxychloroquine(600mg,single-dose) and cyclophosphamide.
