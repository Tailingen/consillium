Combination of Targeted and Immunotherapy for Advanced Biliary Tract and Esophagogastric Gastric Cancer
In this study, non-operable esophagogastric adenocarcinoma cancer patients or non-operable biliary cancer patients whose cancer progressed/spread/got worse after first line treatment will be treated with or without immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This study will take place in several countries across Europe. One hundred twenty-three (123) patients will be invited to participate in this study

Biliary tract cancer (BTC), is a form of cancer that start in your bile ducts, a series of tubes that runs from the liver to the small intestines. It is not know yet the exact cause of BTC. For patients who have advanced or metastatic BTC (where surgery is not possible), chemotherapy is the first option for treatment. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (CisGem) is the current standard of care.

Esophagogastric cancer (EGC) is cancer that occurs in the esophagus, a long hollow tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor in the esophagus that can grow to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body. It's thought that chronic irritation of your esophagus may contribute to the changes that cause esophageal cancer.

The purpose of this study is to look at the risks and benefits of combining DKN-01 and atezolizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody) with or without paclitaxel (chemotherapy). Immune therapy boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer. It uses specific products made either by participants' body or in a laboratory to improve, target or restore immune system function and control or stop cancer. Atezolizumab is such an "immunotherapy" drug. DKN-01 is another new type of drug (humanized monoclonal antibody) in development as anticancer agent. Paclitaxel is a commonly-used chemotherapy drug of the class of taxanes used to treat a number of cancer types, it stimulates the cell to die or to stop the cell from dividing into two new cells.The idea behind combining these drugs is linked to targeting the immune system to attack the tumor. Combining immune and chemotherapy has already demonstrated clinical activity in relapsed (return of the disease)/refractory (not responding to treatment) esophagogastric cancer patients.

DRUG: DKN-01|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Objective response rate, Objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 is computed as the rate of complete and partial responses (with response confirmation), 6 months from start of study treatment
Best overall response distribution, According to RECIST1.1 and iRECIST, 6 months from start of study treatment|Immune objective response rate according to iRECIST, Immune objective response rate according to iRECIST is computed as the rate of immune complete and partial responses (with response confirmation), 6 months from start of study treatment|Duration of response using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR or iCR/iPR are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study (including baseline)., Until 2 years after start of study treatment|Progression free survival according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST is defined as the number of days from date of start of treatment to the date of first progression according to RECIST 1.1 or iRECIST respectively or death, whatever comes first. Patients alive and free of progression prior to the analysis cut-off date are censored at the date of the most recent assessment., Until 2 years after start of study treatment|Occurrence of adverse events, The study uses the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, for adverse event reporting, Until 2 years after start of study treatment|Overall survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the number of days from date of start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient has not died, the data will be censored at the last date documented to be alive, Until 2 years after start of study treatment|Duration of stable disease using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline), Until 2 years after start of study treatment
