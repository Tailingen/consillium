A Dose Escalation/Expansion Study of ERAS-601 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ERAS-601 when administered as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of ERAS-601 when administered as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ERAS-601 when administered as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies.
* To evaluate the antitumor activity of ERAS-601 when administered as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies.

DRUG: ERAS-601|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Based on toxicities observed, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Based on toxicities observed, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Recommended dose (RD), Based on toxicities observed, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs and serious AEs, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose|Plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration of ERAS-601 and cetuximab or pembrolizumab (if applicable), Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Time to achieve Cmax (Tmax), Time to achieve maximum plasma concentration of ERAS-601 and cetuximab or pembrolizumab (if applicable), Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ERAS-601 and cetuximab or pembrolizumab (if applicable), Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Half-life, Half-life of ERAS-601 and cetuximab or pembrolizumab (if applicable), Study Day 1 up to Day 29
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per RECIST version 1.1, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose|Duration of Response (DOR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per RECIST version 1.1, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose|Time to Response (TTR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per RECIST version 1.1, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose
Pharmacodynamic assessment, Assessment of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) inhibition in PBMCs or tumor tissue by IHC or immunofluorescence., Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter clinical study of ERAS-601 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. The study will commence with dose escalation of ERAS-601 monotherapy, followed by dose escalation of ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies. Once the monotherapy MTD and/or RD has been determined, then dose expansion of ERAS-601 monotherapy may commence with enrollment of study participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring specific molecular alterations. Once the combination therapy MTD and/or RD has been determined, then dose expansion of that combination may commence with enrollment of study participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring specific molecular alterations.
