Pharmacodynamic Study of BKM120 in Breast Cancer
BKM120 is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, currently under investigation in a first-in-man study in patients with advanced solid tumors (wild type and PIK3CA-mutated). Consistent, dose-dependent pharmacodynamic activity has been demonstrated and clear signs of anti-tumor activity have been seen with BKM120.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: BKM120
- To determine the grade of inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathways, in pre-surgery setting with BKM120, Biomarkers assessments must be performed at baseline and at the end of study treatment. The following biomarkers will be assessed: PI3K, KRAS, pAkt and -RPS6p, 28 days
Number, grade and relationship of adverse events with BKM120, 28 days|Potential predictive biomarkers (PI3K mutation, KRAS, pAkt and RPS6p) for a pathologic complete response relating to BKM120, 28 days
BKM120 is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, currently under investigation in a first-in-man study in patients with advanced solid tumors (wild type and PIK3CA-mutated). Consistent, dose-dependent pharmacodynamic activity has been demonstrated and clear signs of anti-tumor activity have been seen with BKM120. Three breast cancer patients showed significant tumor shrinkage after â‰¥ 2 months. Two confirmed partial responses (PRs) per RECIST have been seen, one in a patient with a triple negative KRAS-mutated breast cancer and the other in a patient with an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, PIK3CAmutated tumor. Two minor responses have also been observed; one of these occurred in a HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patient.
