Safety Study of 89Zr-NY001 PET Imaging in Patients
This is a single arm study to evaluate the safety and biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled NY001 (89Zr-NY001) PET imaging in patients with fibronectin ED-B domain positive solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 89Zr-NY001
Focal lesion of 89Zr-NY001 PET scanning in patients with fibronectin ED-B domain positive solid tumors., Degree and localization of focal lesion compared with that of 18F-FDG PET scans and according to the expression of fibronectin ED-B domain will be reported., 1 year
After being fully informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will be evaluated to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients will receive an injection of 89Zr-NY001 and will undergo PET/CT scanning to determine uptake of 89Zr-NY001 in tumor lesions and the whole body.
