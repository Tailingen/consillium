A Study of LY2940680 in Pediatric Medulloblastoma or Rhabdomyosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level of LY2940680 that can be safely given to children with medulloblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma that has returned or doesn't respond to initial treatment. The study will also explore the changes in a cancer marker levels. Finally, the study will help document any antitumor activity.
