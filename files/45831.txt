Label-free Raman Spectroscopy for Discrimination Between Breast Cancer Tumor and Adjacent Tissues After Neoadjuvant Treatment
After neoadjuvant therapy, the primary lesion in breast cancer patients may experience tumor regression, which increases the difficulty of distinguishing between breast cancer and adjacent tissues. Raman spectroscopy is a form of scattering spectroscopy, which offers rapid and sensitive analysis, delivering detailed biochemical information and molecular signatures of internal molecular components within the sample. This study aims to discern between cancer and adjacent tissues after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients using label-free Raman spectroscopy.
