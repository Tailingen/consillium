Breast Neoplasms|Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: utidelone|DRUG: docetaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to progression or death (whichever occurred first), up to 60 months
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 60 months|Time to response (TTR), the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease response (CR or PR), up to 60 months|Duration of response (DOR), the time from the first evaluation that criteria for CR or PR are met until PD or death is observed, whichever occurs first, calculated only for patients whose best response is evaluated as CR or PR., up to 60 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to death Time from randomization to death Time from randomization to death Time from randomization to death, up to 60 months|Patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL): FACT-B total score, Change from baseline in the FACT-B total score for all questionnaire timepoints. To calculate FACT-B total score patient ratings from 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much) to each of the 37 questionnaire statement are summed up. Total score range: 0 - 148. Higher values indicate better quality of life., up to 60 months
