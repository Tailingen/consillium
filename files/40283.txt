Trial of Tolcapone With Oxaliplatin for Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (Tolcapone) alone and in combination with oxaliplatin, for relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. Tolcapone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults, but is an investigational drug in this study because it has not been approved in pediatrics for this indication. Oxaliplatin, although a drug approved by the FDA for other cancers, is investigational for treatment of neuroblastoma in this study. This study will look at the safety and tolerability of tolcapone in combination with oxaliplatin as well as the tumors response to this study drug.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Tolcapone|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To determine the safety and tolerability of tolcapone alone and in combination with oxaliplatin at 4 dose levels of tolcapone, 2 years
Determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants using RECIST criteria, To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by the presence of radiologically assessable disease by cross-sectional imaging and in MIBG or PET scans., 3 years|Determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Participants using days until progression, To evaluate the activity of tolcapone in combination with oxaliplatin in relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma based on:

Progression free survival (PFS), 3 years|To evaluate the drug levels and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tolcapone from blood samples at multiple time points within the first 24 hours on study based on Plasma half-life (t1/2)., Tolcapone plasma concentration-time data will be determined for all subjects enrolled on study., 24 hours|To evaluate the drug levels and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tolcapone from blood samples at multiple time points within the first 24 hours on study based on Plasma clearance (Cl)., Tolcapone plasma concentration-time data will be determined for all subjects enrolled on study., 24 hours|To evaluate the drug levels and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tolcapone from blood samples at multiple time points within the first 24 hours on study based on Vd., Tolcapone plasma concentration-time data will be determined for all subjects enrolled on study., 24 hours|To evaluate the drug levels and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tolcapone from blood samples at multiple time points within the first 24 hours on study based on Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Tolcapone plasma concentration-time data will be determined for all subjects enrolled on study., 24 hours|To evaluate the drug levels and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tolcapone from blood samples at multiple time points within the first 24 hours on study based on Area Under the Curve (AUC)., Tolcapone plasma concentration-time data will be determined for all subjects enrolled on study., 24 hours
