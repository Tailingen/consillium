Clinical Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Jalosome® Soothing Gel.
Primary objective

- To investigate the effectiveness of Jalosome® compared with placebo in the prevention and treatment of RID in patients with HNC undergoing RT.

Secondary objectives:

* To investigate the effectiveness of Jalosome® in reducing the maximum severity of RID compared with placebo.
* To investigate the effect of Jalosome®, compared with placebo, on patients' quality of life.
* To investigate safety and tolerability of Jalosome®.
* To investigate patient's compliance to Jalosome® treatment.
* To investigate patient's global satisfaction with Jalosome® treatment.
Radiation-induced Dermatitis
DEVICE: Jalosome® soothing gel|DEVICE: Placebo
Time to development of G2 RID, Mean number of days in development of G2 RID (according to CTCA), in the Jalosome® and placebo arms., 9 weeks
Subjects without G2 RID at the end of RT, Number and percentage of subjects without G2 RID at the end of RT, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.., 9 weeks|Subjects without G2 RID at different timepoints, Number and percentage of subjects without G2 RID at different timepoints (week 5, week 6 and two weeks after the last radiation) in the Jalosome® and placebo arms., 9 weeks|Worst skin toxicity, Number and percentage of subjects with worst skin toxicity G3, G2 and G1 RID according to CTCAE v.4.0, during treatment and up to 2 weeks after the last administration of RT, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms., 9 weeks|RID grade on the RISRAS, Mean RID grade on the Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale scale (RISRAS), assessed weekly, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.

RISRAS score varies from 0 to 36, where 0 is normal skin/no symptoms at all and 36 is the worst conditions in terms of erythema-Dry desquamation - Moist desquamation - necrosis of derma (14 points) and very severe symptoms (12 points)., 9 weeks|PRO-Skindex-16 questionnaire score, Mean score of each item (16 items) of PRO-Skindex-16 questionnaire performed weekly, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms. Each item is about skin discomfort, ancd the scores vary from 0 (no discomfort) to 6 (full discomfort)., 9 weeks|Pain measured by NRS, Mean pain measured by the 11-point Numeric rating scale (NRS) of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), as reported in patients' diary (daily) and assessed during visits (weekly), in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.

NRS score varies from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable., 9 weeks|Compliance, Number and percentage of patients with compliance to Jalosome® treatment ≥80%., 9 weeks|Adverse events, Number and percentage of adverse events by grade, according to the CTCAE v.4.0, and relationship with the treatment., 9 weeks
Primary endpoint:

* Mean time difference in development of G2 RID (according to CTCA) between Jalosome® and placebo arms. A median difference of at least 7 days is considered of clinical significance.

  • Secondary endpoints:
* Proportion of subjects without G2 RID at the end of RT, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* Proportion of subjects without G2 RID at different timepoints (week 5, week 6 and two weeks after the last radiation) in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* Worst skin toxicity during treatment and up to 2 weeks after the last radiation, according to CTCAE, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* RID grade (mean and worst) on the RISRAS scale, assessed weekly, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* Mean and worst score of PRO-Skindex-16 questionnaire performed weekly, in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* Mean pain measured by the 11-point NRS of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), as reported in patients' diary (daily) and assessed during visits (weekly), in the Jalosome® and placebo arms.
* Patient's compliance to Jalosome® treatment.
* Patient's global satisfaction with Jalosome® treatment.
* Jalosome® overall safety and tolerability.

Study design:

Monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial.
