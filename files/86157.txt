High Dose IL-2 and Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy for Metastatic Renal Cancer
In this i-SABR (immunotherapy + Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation) trial, the stereotactic radiation to multiple metastatic sites is delivered not only to eradicate sites of bulky progressive disease, but also to provide antigen presentation and immune stimulation which is expected to act synergistically when immediately followed by the non-specific immune stimulation provided by treatment with HD IL-2 and thereby increase the response rate and complete response for metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer patients. Both HD IL-2 and SABR are FDA approved therapeutic cancer treatment
Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: IL-2|RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy
Response Rate, Treatment response will be measured using the immune related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (iRECIST) which are a minor modification of RECIST 1.1 for immunotherapy, 6 months
Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS), which is defined as the time between date of registration and the date of death due to any cause., 4 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS), which is defined according to the immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) as the time between date of registration and the first date of documented disease progression or date of death due to any cause., 4 years|Time to Progression, Time to Progression (TTP), which is defined as time between date of registration and date of documented progression, 4 years|Local Control Rate, Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence within the planning target volume. Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques such as CT or MRI. Local recurrence will be defined as an increase of \> 20% in tumor size., 4 years|Median Response Duration, Median response duration, which is defined as the time between the date a response (CR or PR) was first seen until date of progression, 4 years|Tumor-specific Immune Response, Immune response will be measured using ELISpot assay, T-cell proliferation assay and ELISA., 4 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events will be determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0., 4 years|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL)., 4 years
