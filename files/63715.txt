High Resolution Anuscopy Study
The majority of anal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) stem from infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Anal SCC is rare among the general population but affects several populations disproportionately.

High-risk groups are screened through anal swabs for anal cytology and detection of high risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV). HRA referral is recommended for individuals with abnormal cytology.

HRA represents the only method to identify precancerous lesions of the anal canal, with only few specialists knowledgeable about it.

At UZ Brussel, the investigators collected a wealth of data about HPV infection and its association with anal pathology. By establishing a comprehensive study, the investigators can delve into this data with specific research questions, conducting valuable research to provide answers to pressing clinical questions and contribute to advancements in medical understanding and treatment.
