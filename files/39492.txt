All trans retinoic acid Combined with Toripalimab+Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced inoperable or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer：a multi-center, multi-cohort phase II trial
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
DRUG: Cohort2: ATRA+Toripalimab+TPC|DRUG: Cohort1: ATRA+Toripalimab+chemo
Objective Response Rate (ORR), During the combined therapy, tumor assessment (enhanced CT) is conducted every 3 cycles (6 weeks), and the efficacy is evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. ORR will be summarized as the proportion of subjects achieving objective tumor responses (complete response or partial response). ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated., up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time from initiation of therapy to death, or censored at last follow-up date if the Patient is alive and will be calculated based on modified RECIST version 1.1 and iRECIST. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate OS with 95% CI., up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from initiation of therapy to the time of RECIST progression or death and will be calculated based on modified RECIST version 1.1 and iRECIST. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate PFS with 95% CI., up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, up to 2 years|Adverse events, Adverse events and toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0 criteria. Medical review of adverse events and laboratory values will be conducted, and a safety assessment will be completed. Safety assessments will be conducted for all subjects receiving the study drug, with evaluation starting from the date of informed consent signing and continuing until the study concludes or 30 days after drug discontinuation., up to 2 years|Skin adverse reactions, Incidence of hand foot syndrome,, maculopapular rash, itching, urticaria, and pigmentation Skin rash and erythema NCI CTCAE level severity Dermatology Quality of Life Questionnaire (DLQI), up to 2 years|Biomarker analysis, up to 2 years
