Characteristics, Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Patients With Surgically Resected Lung Cancers
This study is a multi-center, observational, real-world study for patients with resected lung cancers in China. With the help of a properly designed data processing algorithm and extensively performed data quality assurance, this study aims to harness the potential of real-world big data to (1) describe characteristics and treatment patterns and their evolving trends; (2) discover features associated with overall survival; and (3) address recently-emerging clinical questions.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China. The recent decade witnessed rapid evolving of demographics, pathological features and prognoses of patients with surgically resected lung cancers. The introduction of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) concept and techniques, targeted therapy and immunotherapy changed treatment landscape for patients with surgically resected lung cancers. With more early-stage lung cancers discovered due to the application of CT screening, questions focusing on extent of lung resection, lymph node dissection, application of targeted or immune-therapy to early-stage lung cancers are emerging. This study aims to create a cohort of patients with surgically resected lung cancers and an analytic framework to address the aforementioned clinical questions.
