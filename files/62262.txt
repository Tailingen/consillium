CT Perfusion Parameters Predict Vascular Pattern in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Distinct vascular patterns (ECTC or Non-ECTC) of tumors plays an important role in tumor migration, metastasis and drug resistant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is no non-invasive method to predict vascular pattern in clinical. In the present study, we prospectively assess CT perfusion parameters for evaluation of the vascular pattern in HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: CT perfusion examination
Predictive performance of CT perfusion, The primary outcome of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specifity of CT perfusion in predicting vascular pattern of HCC, 6 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of randomization until death from any cause, 6 months|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival is calculated from the date of surgery to tumor recurrence or death from any cause (or the date of the last follow-up if the patient was alive), 6 months
