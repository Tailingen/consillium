A Study of Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214: BEMPEG) in Combination With Nivolumab Compared With the Investigator's Choice of a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Therapy (Either Sunitinib or Cabozantinib Monotherapy) for Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
The main purpose of this study is to compare the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) of bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214: BEMPEG) combined with nivolumab to that of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy (sunitinib or cabozantinib) in IMDC intermediate- or poor-risk patients and IMDC all-risk patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per mRECIST 1.1 by BICR in IMDC All-risk Patients and Intermediate- or Poor (I/P)-Risk Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced RCC, ORR using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) 1.1 by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) All-risk patients and intermediate- or poor-risk patients.

ORR is defined as the proportion of enrolled participants who achieved a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR is calculated as the sum of CR and PR., Approximately 32 months|Overall Survival (OS) in IMDC All-Risk and Intermediate- or Poor-risk Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced RCC, OS is defined as the time from date of first dose to the date of death from any cause. Patients without a date of death were censored at their last known alive date., Approximately 32 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per mRECIST 1.1 by BICR in IMDC All-risk Patients and Intermediate- or Poor (I/P)-Risk Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced RCC, Progression-free survival is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented tumor progression using mRECIST 1.1 per BICR or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Approximately 32 months
