Study of Image-Guided SBRT for Vertebral Metastases
Based on the known efficacy of ablative single dose SBRT and VMAT technique in various solid tumors, investigators have designed this study to assess feasibility of SBRT in selected patients with spine metastases.
Vertebral Metastases
RADIATION: Single dose SBRT and VMAT technique
Toxicity of single fraction SBRT on spine metastases using CTCAE v.4, 1 year|Local control of the treated lesions using Kaplan-Meyer statistical curves, 1 year
Pain control at treated sites after RT using CTCAE v.4, 3 months|Local control of the metastatic disease using Kaplan-Meyer statistical curves, 3 months|Overall survival of treated patients using Kaplan-Meyer statistical curves, 1 year|Difference of local and pain control between patients operated on vertebra and non-operated patients using CTCAE v.4, 3 months
This is a prospective, phase 2 study. The main objectives are to assess acute and late side effects of single fraction SBRT for selected patients with vertebral metastases and to study the local control of disease in treated sites.

The schedule will be 1 fraction of 18 Gy delivered in one day with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Flattening filter-free (FFF) beams.
