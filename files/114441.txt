Dose-Escalation Study of E7727, an Oral Cytidine Deaminase Inhibitor With Oral Decitabine in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 study of the combination of cedazuridine with decitabine in patients with solid tumors. At least 6 patients will be enrolled per treatment level to assess optimal hypomethylation and toxicity (up to 35 patients total).
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Cedazuridine
Safety and tolerability of combination cedazuridine with decitabine as assessed by number of participants who experience adverse events, Number of participants who have experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), up to 2 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) as determined by number of participants with of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the maximum dose at which the least number of participants experience dose-limiting toxicity. The dose limiting toxicity is defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., up to 2 years
Pharmacokinetics of ASTX727 in solid tumor patients as measured by total exposure, Total exposure will be calculated as area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by using non-compartmental methods (Winonlin, version 5.3 or newer) and/or compartmental modeling (Adapt II, release 4.0), Day 2|Pharmacokinetics of ASTX727 in solid tumor patients as measured by maximum concentration (Cmax), Cmax (mmol/L) is defined as the maximum concentration of ASTX727 in blood., Day 2|Pharmacokinetics of ASTX727 in solid tumor patients as measured by time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax (minutes) is defined as the time to reach maximum concentration of ASTX727 in blood., Day 2|Objective response rate (ORR) in solid tumor patients who are treated with ASTX727, Proportion of participants who had measurable disease at baseline and have been re-evaluated after at least 1 cycle of therapy with observed reduction in tumor burden as defined by RECIST 1.1: Complete response (CR)= disappearance of all target lesions, Partial response (PR)= at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, up to 2 years
