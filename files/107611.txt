A Study of Tazemetostat With Enzalutamide or Abiraterone/Prednisone in Participants With Advanced Prostate Cancer
This is a global, multi-center, open-label, randomized phase 1b/2, active-controlled safety and efficacy study of oral administration of tazemetostat in combination with enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone (phase 1b) versus enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone alone in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on either abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or apalutamide or who are second generation anti-androgen treatment naive, and who have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC.

This study is designed to determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with either enzalutamide or abiraterone/prednisone, based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy profiles.

Ph 1b: Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), An Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., At end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Ph 1b: Select the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of tazemetostat for each combination, Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic parameters as well as efficacy and the overall tolerability of each of the combinations (tazemetost with enzalutamide or tazemetostat with abiraterone/prednisone), 1 cycle/28 days|Ph 2: Change in radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), Assessed by change radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for progression in bone or in soft tissue, Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13, and every 12 weeks after Cycle 13 for 1 year (each cycle is 28 days)
Phase 1b and 2: Percentage of participants with a ≥50% decline of Prostate Specific-Antigen (PSA50)., For participants with a baseline PSA ≥2.0 ug/L (ng/mL) per PCWG3 criteria, From baseline at any time on study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and 2: Objective response rate (ORR) and best overall response (BOR) in soft tissue, According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) guidelines., At 6 months on treatment.|Phase 1b and 2: Disease control rate (DCR), Assessed by radiographic progression per PCWG3 criteria, with no unequivocal clinical progression or death, At 6 months on treatment.|Phase 1b and 2: Time to first skeletal-related event (SRE), During screening and every 9 weeks if clinically indicated at baseline, average of one year|Phase 1b and 2: Time to initiation of the next systemic treatment for prostate cancer (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of first documented administration of the next systemic treatment for prostate cancer., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and 2: Time to PSA progression (TTPP), Defined as the duration per PCWG3 criteria in months., From baseline to the day of PSA progression, an average one one year.|Phase 1b and 2: Reduction in circulating tumor cells (CTC), From a state of having a detectable number of CTCs to having an undetectable number of CTCs, From screening to 30 days after last dose|Phase 1b and 2: CTC response rate, Defined as the percentage of participants with a ≥30% reduction in CTC number, From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and 2: AUC0-last: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration., AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and 2:AUC0-24: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of 24 hours., AUC_0-24 is defined as the concentration of drug over time from time zero to 24 hours., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 1b and 2: Cmax: maximum plasma concentration., Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 2: Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), Assessed by Well-being Subscale (FWB) and Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) scores, From baseline to end of study, an average of one year|Phase 2: Time to definitive deterioration (TDD) in functional status and in prostate symptoms, Assessed by the FACT-P FWB and PCS scores., From baseline to end of study, an average of one year
