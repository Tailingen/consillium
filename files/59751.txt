A Study of CTX-009 in Adult Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study is designed as an open-label, adaptive Simon Two-Stage study to evaluate the efficacy of CTX-009 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

A Simon Two-Stage adaptive design will enroll approximately 37 patients into Stage 1, and if criteria are met to move to Stage 2, an additional 47 patients will be enrolled.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DRUG: CTX-009
Overall Response Rate, Percentage of patients whose Best Overall Response (BOR) is assessed as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average of 6 months
Disease Control Rate, Percentage of patients whose BOR is assessed as CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD), From C1D1 to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average of 6 months|Duration of Response, The time between the date of the radiological evaluation that first confirmed CR or PR and the date of the radiation evaluation that first confirmed Progressive Disease (PD), From first confirmed CR or PR to confirmed PD, average of 6 months|Progression Free Survival, Time from C1D1 until the date of objective PD (as assessed by RECIST v1.1) or the date of death (by any cause in the absence of disease progression), From C1D1 to first documented objective PD or death if PD does not occur, average of 6 months|Overall Survival, Time from C1D1 until the date of death by any cause. Patients who are still alive at the time of the analysis, or who have become lost to follow-up or withdrawn consent will be censored at their last date known to be alive, From C1D1 to death from any cause, average of 9 months|Safety Profile of CTX-009, Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and changes in clinical abnormalities for all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, From C1D1 to 60 days after the last dose of study treatment, average of 7 months|Quality of Life Changes, Assessed approximately every 2 months from patient reported data using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 as compared to baseline responses, From screening to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average of 6 months|Exposure Response by Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sampling, Serum concentrations of CTX-009 at specified timepoints, From C1D1 to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average of 6 months
