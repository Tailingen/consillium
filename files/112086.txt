The Safety and Efficacy of First-line Lazertinib and Locally Ablative Radiotherapy in Patients With Synchronous Oligo-metastatic EGFR-mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is based on the observations that disease progression under EGFR(Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) targeting TKI(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) most frequently occurs at the original sites of metastatic disease and that the majority of patients shows disease progression in a limited number of metastatic lesions, a situation defined as oligoprogression.

All studies reported a significantly and clinically relevant improved OS(Overall Survival) or PFS(Period Free Survival) for adding locally ablative therapy to standard of care systemic therapy. However, these studies included only very few NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patients with activating driver mutations and the benefit of adding upfront local radiotherapy might be smaller or larger in this NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patient population with activating driver mutations and treatment with TKIs(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) smaller because of the higher systemic efficacy of TKIs(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) compared to chemotherapy or larger because the benefit of local treatment might become most obvious if potential microscopic disease is successfully controlled by TKI(Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor)s .Consequently, there is a clinical need to evaluate locally ablative therapy in oligometastatic EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) -mutant NSCLC(non small cell lunc cancer) patients and simultaneously a strong rational that this population might benefit in particular from a combined modality treatment: the benefit of locally ablative therapy is expected to be largest in situations of effective systemic therapies to control locally untreated microscopic disease which is true for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) targeting.

The investigator therefore propose a prospective two-arm phase II study, which aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of lazertinib combined with early locally ablative radiotherapy of all cancer sites in patients with synchronous oligometastatic (primary tumour and maximum 5 metastases) EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) -mutant (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) NSCLC. Eradication of all macroscopic cancer sites at the time of primary diagnosis by combined modality treatment is expected to decrease the risk of resistance development with only microscopic disease potentially remaining. This will result in an improvement of PFS(Period Free Survival) and OS(Overall Survival) without added high-grade toxicity.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Lazertinib , a combination group of SBRT|DRUG: Lazertinib single administration group
Progression free survival (PFS), The time to recurrence/progression/death and From start of Lazertinib to documented radiographic relapse/progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria, every 8 weeks after enrollment, an average of one year|Progression free survival (PFS), The time to recurrence/progression/death and From start of Lazertinib to documented radiographic relapse/progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria, disease progression, an average of one year
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until death from any cause. Censoring will occur at the last follow-up date., Every 12 weeks after the end of the study , which will be conducted in about 3 years.|Distant Progression free survival (Distant PFS), Distant PFS is defined as the time from date of enrollment until development of new metastases, excluding oligometastases diagnosed at enrolment., At screening, every 8 weeks after enrollment, and when the disease progresses. This is expected to be an average of one year.|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients that achieve a best overall response \[complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)\] according to RECIST v1.1 from enrolment across all trial assessment time-points., At screening, every 8 weeks after enrollment, and when the disease progresses. This is expected to be an average of one year.|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the interval from the date of first documentation of objective response (CR or PR, according to RECIST v1.1) to the date of first documented progression, relapse or death., At screening, every 8 weeks after enrollment, and when the disease progresses. This is expected to be an average of one year.|Adverse event according to CTCAE(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event) v5.0, AE captured by CYCAE 5.0 until after 30days of last administration., Screening, every cycle visit and End of study, and evaluation up to 6 weeks after End of the study. This is is expected to be an average of one year.|Pattern of disease progression, The pattern of disease progression is defined as the site of first progression: None, locoregional, distant (bone, brain, liver, etc) or both locoregional and distant, evaluated up to 18-months post enrollment., At screening, every 8 weeks after enrollment, and when the disease progresses. This is expected to be an average of one year.|Exploratory analysis (Analysis of acquired resistance mechanism through cfDNA), â€¢ Analysis of acquired resistance mechanisms to lazertinib plus radiotherapy at the time of progression using tumor/liquid cfDNA biopsy, At Screening and disease progression. This is expected to be an average of one year.
