Prospective Cohort of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma in France
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in 90% of cirrhosis primary liver cancers. In France, 8,500 new cases of HCC occur each year, and about 8,000 deaths per year are related to this cancer. The 5-year survival rate is 10%, one of the lowest survival rates of all cancer types. HCC raises a number of major challenges: HCC is discovered at a curable stage in only 25% of cases, reflecting the marked delay in the diagnosis of early stages. The state of knowledge about HCC is well behind that of other cancers (no biomarker, complex carcinogenesis, influence of the aetiology, poorly valorised data, etc.). Rapid technological progress requires large-scale studies to evaluate new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.

The CHIEF project constitutes a common basis knowledge for research project using prospectively collected data in patients with HCC, regardless of the cause and stage of the cancer.

This project is a Multicentre longitudinal observational study of patients with HCC with prospective data collection on inclusion and patient follow-up. Constitution of a biological resources collection. 5,000 patients will be included over 2 years with a follow-up of patients of 5 years.
