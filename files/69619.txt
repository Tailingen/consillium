A Study Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Adding Ipatasertib to Paclitaxel Treatment in Participants With Breast Cancer That Has Spread Beyond the Initial Site, and the Cancer Does Not Have Certain Hormonal Receptors
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will estimate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel compared with placebo combined with paclitaxel in participants with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) in all participants and in participants with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-low tumors.

DRUG: Ipatasertib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments by RECIST, v1.1 or death on study (\<=30 days after the last dose of study treatment regimen) from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration (Clinical Cut Off Date: 07 June 2016)|PFS in Participants With Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN)-Low Tumors, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments by RECIST, v1.1 or death on study (\<=30 days after the last dose of study treatment regimen) from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration (Clinical Cut Off Date: 07 June 2016)

Confirmed ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete response or partial response based on the investigator assessment that was confirmed by a repeat assessment no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response was first met. Subjects for whom no records of post-baseline tumor assessments were reported were counted as non-responders. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Most questions used 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much; 2 questions used 7-point scale \[1=very poor to 7=Excellent\]). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; a higher score=better level of functioning. For symptom scale scores, higher level=severe level of symptoms.
