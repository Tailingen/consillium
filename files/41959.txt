Study of REN-1654 in Patients With Sciatica Pain
The purpose of this study is to gain initial safety and efficacy data on the experimental agent REN-1654 in patients with pain that radiates down the leg(s), and is typical of sciatica (lumbosacral radiculopathy). These patients will usually have a herniated disc that is causing compression on the nerves coming out of the spinal column.
Sciatica|Herniated Disc|Radiculopathy
DRUG: REN-1654
Leg Pain: Change in Average Daily 11-Point Categorical Pain Intensity Rating at the end of the 3-week treatment period
Initiation of the following clinical interventions and time to intervention, if elected, through the 3-week treatment period and 3-week post treatment follow-up period:|[1] Local, regional, or spinal (articular, epidural, intrathecal, or nerve root block) injections of medications for pain treatment. [2] Surgery for treatment of sciatica symptoms|Use of concomitant analgesic medications (tracked by daily log of medication usage)|Back Pain: Change in Average Daily Categorical Pain Intensity|Leg Pain: Change in Maximum (or movement-induced) Daily Categorical Pain Intensity Rating|Back Pain: Change in Maximum (or movement-induced) Daily Categorical Pain Intensity|Change in Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire; Change in Straight Leg Raising test|Change in muscle weakness|Change in sensory deficit|Change in tendon reflexes|Global impression of change: subject and investigator
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy and tolerability of REN-1654 in subjects with sciatica. After screening and baseline clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive REN 1654 100 mg or matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks. Leg pain, back pain and other efficacy measures will be assessed at 1 and 3 weeks after initiation of treatment. A subset of patients will undergo analysis of blood levels of REN-1654 during the course of the study (pharmacokinetics). Subjects will discontinue treatment after 3 weeks and return after a further 3 weeks off therapy for a final clinical assessment 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. If a subject does not return for follow-up, an effort will be made by telephone to document their clinical status and whether other interventions have been made.
