Effect of Anesthesia on Force Application During Colonoscopy
The aim of the study is to determine if more force is used during colonoscopy when patients receive monitored anesthesia with propofol versus conscious sedation. Force measurements will be performed using the colonoscopy force monitor (CFM). This device measures the magnitude and direction of force applied to the insertion tube of a standard colonoscope during colonoscopy.
Outpatient Colonoscopy for Colorectal Cancer Screening or for Symptoms Suggestive of Colonic Diseases
DEVICE: Colonoscopy Force Monitor
Peak push force is increased in patients receiving propofol as compared to conscious sedation., 6 months
Randomized factorial design of colonoscopy with either propofol administered anesthesia or conscious sedation. Twelve experienced endoscopists from community and academic centers will perform colonoscopy using either propofol or conscious sedation on a group of 12 patients for each endoscopist for a study total of 144 patients. An equal number of male and female patients will be included in each group.
