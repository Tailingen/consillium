Combination Chemotherapy of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin With or Without Anthracycline as Aneo Adjuvant Treatment in Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma
Endometrial cancer, the most common gynecologic cancer worldwide, is steadily increasing in developed countries.The early-stage forms of endometrial cancer are usually highly curable by surgical treatment alone, whereas advanced stages require adjuvant interdictions such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Platinum and anthracycline drugs have long been used as standard adjuvant chemotherapy drugs for advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinomas. In one study, the standard combination adjuvant treatment with AP was found to be more effective as an adjuvant therapy than whole abdominal irradiation
