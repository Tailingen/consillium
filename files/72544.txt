Feasibility of Internet Based Support (Carer eSupport) for Informal Caregivers of Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
Informal caregivers to patients with head and neck cancer report that they are unprepared for caregiving, that they experience a high caregiver burden and a deteriorated health. The aim is to develop an internet based intervention for informal caregivers of individuals with head and neck cancer and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The internet based intervention (Carer eSupport) will be based on scientific evidence, established theoretical frameworks and focus groups with caregivers and health care professionals. The feasibility and acceptability of Carer eSupport will be evaluated by 30 caregivers who will have access to Carer eSupport during one months. The feasibility and acceptability of Carer eSupport will be evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data.
