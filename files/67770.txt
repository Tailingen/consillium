Long-Term Follow-up Study
This is an observational, non-interventional, LTFS of investigational Caribou therapies in patients who have participated in a parent study: a prior Caribou-sponsored clinical study, special access program, or an IIT. The objective is to evaluate the long-term safety, through 15 years post infusion, in patients who received IPs in a Caribou-sponsored clinical study, special access program or IIT.
