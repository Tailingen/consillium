Safety Study of Human Myeloid Progenitor Cells (CLT-008) After Cord Blood Transplant for Hematologic Malignancy
Ex vivo expanded human myeloid progenitor cells (hMPCs; CLT-008) have the potential to accelerate neutrophil recovery in patients receiving myeloablative conditioning as part of an umbilical cord blood transplant for hematologic cancer. In this study, the safety and tolerability of CLT-008 administered 24 hours after an umbilical cord blood transplant will be determined by monitoring for adverse reactions, neutrophil and platelet recovery, hematopoietic chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections.
