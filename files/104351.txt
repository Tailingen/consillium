Phase I Study of HS-20108 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I clinical study of HS-20108. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of intravenous HS-20108 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-20108 Monotherapy
MTD or MAD of HS-20108, the maximum tolerated dose or maximum appropriate dose, up to approximately 48 months
Incidence of adverse events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product, which may present with symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but do not necessarily have a causality with the investigational product., up to approximately 48 months|Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a CR or PR that was confirmed at a subsequent scan at least 4 weeks later, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., up to approximately 48 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control was deﬁned as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response (confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease for at least 5 weeks)., up to approximately 48 months.|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response assessed by RECIST 1.1. Duration of response was defined as the time from when the criteria for CR or PR were first met to the occurrence of an objective disease progression (PD) or death., up to approximately 48 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression of tumor was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate progression free survival. Progression-free survival was deﬁned as the time from date of ﬁrst dose until the documentation of objective PD or death from any cause in the absence of progression (whichever occurred first), regardless of whether they subsequently received non-study anti-cancer therapy., up to approximately 48 months.|overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first study treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 48 months.|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-20108, Cmax of HS-20108, up to approximately 48 months.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of HS-20108, AUC of HS-20108, up to approximately 48 months.
This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of intravenous HS-20108 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of Phase Ia (dose escalation) and Phase Ib (dose expansion). In Phase Ia, dose escalation will conduct to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced solid tumors. In Phase Ib, potential indications (such as small cell lung cancer or neuroendocrine carcinoma) will be selected for the early proof-of-concept study of HS-20108 at different doses based on the study data from Phase Ia, the translational medicine research data and R\&D progress in the field.
