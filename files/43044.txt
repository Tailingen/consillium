Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer Patients Aged 75 Years or Older.
The majority of all new prostate cancer cases are diagnosed in men aged \> 70 years, with the highest incidence in men aged \> 90 years. Management options for localized prostate cancer include active surveillance in patients with low-risk disease, radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.

In previous studies, hypofractionated prostate cancer irradiation regimens have been shown to represent a highly effective treatment option for prostate cancer. However, patients aged 75 years or older were underrepresented in most trials resulting in the lack of a robust evidence base.

The proposed study will evaluate radiation-induced toxicity as well as outcome after hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients aged 75 years or older.
