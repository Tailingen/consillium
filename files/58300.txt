A Study of VEGF-Antisense Oligonucleotide in Combination With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin for the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Mesothelioma
This will be a single institution non-randomized phase I/II trial for patients with malignant mesothelioma stage II and above, who have not received prior chemotherapy for their disease.

The purpose of this phase is to select a dose of VEGF-AS (antiangiogenesis drug)to be given with standard doses of pemetrexed followed by cisplatin on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
Mesothelioma
DRUG: VEGF-Antisense Oligonucleotide , Pemetrexed, Cisplatin
The primary endpoint of the phase II trial will be time to progression, Tumor measurements every 6 weeks
Secondary endpoints are objective response rate and overall survival, Every 6 weeks evaluations
The Study Objectives in Phase I are:

To determine the safety of the combination of VEGF-Antisense Oligonucleotide (VEGF-AS, Veglinâ„¢) plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in subjects with advanced Malignant Mesothelioma,.via a dose escalation protocol. To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of VEGF-AS plus Premetrexed and Cisplatin. To determine the time to disease progression To determine the objective response rate of the combination of VEGF-AS plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin for the treatment of advanced malignant mesothelioma

The study Objectives in Phase II are:

To further characterize the toxicity experienced by patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with VEGF-AS plus Cisplatin and Pemetrexed.

To determine median and overall survival.

The Laboratory objectives are:

To measure plasma VEGF levels before, during, and after therapy as a correlate of outcome. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of VEGF-AS plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin.
