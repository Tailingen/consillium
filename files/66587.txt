CTLA-4 and PD-1 Antibodies Expressing Mesothelin-CAR-T Cells for Mesothelin Positive Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a single-arm, open-label, one center clinical study, to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express immune checkpoint antibodies (CTLA-4 and PD-1) and chimeric antigen receptor targeting mesothelin (mesoCAR-T) in adult patients with mesothelin positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: CTLA-4/PD-1 antibodies expressing mesoCAR-T
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Determine treatment-related adverse events of the immunotherapy with common toxicity criteria for adverse effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 2 years
The response evaluation of of the treatment for advanced solid tumors, The efficacy of the treatment is assessed according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor version 1.1 (RECIST1.1), which is defined as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD)., 2 years
Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which tumor progresses or the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years|The quality of life as assessed by EORTC QLQ-30, The quality of life is assessed before and after the treatment by EORTC QLQ-30., 2 years|Proliferation and persistence of EGFR-CAR-T cells in peripheral blood, CAR-T proportion in peripheral blood of the patients is detected by flow cytometry assay to study the proliferation and persistence of mesothelin specific CAR-T cells., 6 months|CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies levels in peripheral blood, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies levels are detected by ELISA assay to asess the expressing level of CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies from CAR-T cells., 6 months
This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the efficacy and safety of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing mesothelin-CAR-T (mesoCAR-T) for patients with mesothelin positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MesoCAR-T can specificly and effectively kill the mesothelin positive cancer cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies are secreted from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by leukapheresis, then activated and engineered to CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing and chimeric antigen receptor targeting mesothelin. Cells are proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion. A total of 40 patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months.
