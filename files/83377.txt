Pilot Study for TCE Imaging of the Esophagus Using an OFDI Capsule With a Compact Imaging System
The goal of this research is to test a distal scanning capsule and a compact redesigned version of the OFDI imaging system in healthy and BE subjects to assess ease of use, safety and feasibility in preparation for its use in a multicenter clinical trial.
Barrett's Esophagus
DEVICE: Experimental OFDI Imaging
Assessment of quality and performance of Compact Imaging System (CIS), Images obtained from the CIS will be assessed for quality and compared to images acquired from the previous imaging system, 5-7 Minutes of imaging
Ten healthy volunteer subjects and ten volunteers with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) will be enrolled in the study.

The capsule is attached to a string-like tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using peristalsis.

Images of the esophagus will be acquired in real time to be analyzed later.
