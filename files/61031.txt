National Marrow Donor Program Long-Term Donor Follow-Up
This is an observational study of unstimulated bone marrow (BM) and filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors. The primary goal is to evaluate the hypothesis that the incidence of targeted malignant, thrombotic and autoimmune disorders after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donation are similar between unstimulated BM and filgrastim-mobilized PBSC donors.
Hematologic Neoplasms
Incidence of malignant myeloid hematologic disorders, To describe the long-term incidence of malignant myeloid hematologic disorders in donors who received and in those who did not receive filgrastim., Post HSCT donation
This is an observational study of unstimulated bone marrow (BM) and filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors. The primary goal is to evaluate the hypothesis that the incidence of targeted malignant, thrombotic and autoimmune disorders after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donation are similar between unstimulated BM and filgrastim-mobilized PBSC donors. Donors will undergo biennial surveys until study completion. Cases of targeted disorders will be reviewed by the medical monitors to confirm the veracity of the report.
