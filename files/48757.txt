A Study of GH21 Combined With Previous Target Therapy or Immunotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is aim to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of GH21 combined with previous target therapy or immunotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: PD-1|DRUG: MET inhibitor|DRUG: ALK inhibitor|DRUG: BRAF Inhibito|DRUG: EGFR Monoclonal antibody|DRUG: GH21|DRUG: MEK Inhibitor
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (CR+PR)., 3 years
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging and ophthalmological assessments., 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria, DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy termination, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCRï¼‰Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria, DCR is defined as proportion of participants with complete response, partial response, stable disease(CR+PR+SD)., 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria, PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of first treatment to the earliest date of disease progression or death which occurs first., 3 years|Plasma Peak Concentration (Cmax), Highest observed plasma concentration of GH21., 3 years|Time to Achieve Cmax (Tmax), Time of highest observed plasma concentration of GH21., 3 years|Area under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve of GH21., 3 years
This study preset two dose groups, dose group 1 is GH21 15 mg (BIW, D1D2) combined with ALK inhibitor, or MET inhibitor, or BRAF inhibitor +MEK inhibitor, or PD-1 inhibitor, or EGFR monoantibody, or other drugs such as FGFR inhibitor, and it is planned to enroll up to 36 subjects. Dose group 2 was GH21 6 mg (QD) combined with ALK inhibitor, or MET inhibitor, or BRAF inhibitor +MEK inhibitor, or PD-1 inhibitor, or EGFR monoclonal antibody, or other drugs such as FGFR inhibitor, and was planned to enroll up to 36 subjects.
