ctDNA-MRD in Stage IIIB-C NSCLC Patients Treated With Induction Chemoimmunotherapy
The goal of this observational study is to explore whether ctDNA-MRD dynamic monitoring can more effectively predict the therapeutic effect of induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery or non-surgical treatment for stage IIIB-C driver-negative NSCLC in the MDT model, so as to accurately guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: NGS and ctDNA-MRD detection
Predicting Progression Free Survival, Ability of dynamic ctDNA-MRD assessment to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in stage IIIB-C driver-negative NSCLC patients receiving induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery or non-surgical therapy, up to 5 years|Predicting pathologic complete response, Ability of dynamic ctDNA-MRD assessment to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in stage IIIB-C driver-negative NSCLC patients receiving induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery, Up to 1 year|Predicting Overall Survival, Ability of dynamic ctDNA-MRD assessment to predict overall survival (OS) in stage IIIB-C driver-negative NSCLC patients receiving induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery or non-surgical therapy, up to 5 years
Objective response rate(ORR), The proportion of patients achieved complete or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 prior to definitive surgery., Up to 1 year|Adverse events (AEs), Number of patients experiencing AEs will be recorded. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to 5 years|Perioperative complications rate, Number of patients experiencing perioperative complications will be recorded., Up to 3 years|Health-related Quality of Life, Health-related Quality of Life will be assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0., Up to 5 years|Perioperative pain evaluation, Perioperative pain evaluation assessed by a numeric rating scale (NRS). A total of 11 points from 0 to 10 are used to describe the pain intensity. 0 means no pain, the number of points increases when the pain is stronger, and 10 means the most intense pain., Up to 3 years|Lung cancer-related Quality of Life, Health-related Quality of Life will be assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire in Lung Cancer., Up to 5 years
This study is a single-center, observational, non-interventional, prospective study. 50 patients diagnosed with stage IIIB-C driver-negative NSCLC receiving induction chemoimmunotherapy will be planned to be enrolled in the study. Pre-treatment biopsy tissues of enrolled patients will be collected for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of institutionally-developed 1021-gene panel, and personalized detection panel will be customized based on NGS testing results. Patients will be received induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery or non-surgical treatment in the MDT model and ctDNA-MRD testing will be performed at prespecified time points. For patients who received surgery following induction therapy, peripheral blood will be collected in baseline, 1 day before the third cycle of neoadjuvant therapy, 1 day before surgery, 3 days after surgery and landmark time and pulmonary venous blood will be collected intraoperatively. For patients who received non-surgical treatment following induction therapy, peripheral blood will be collected in baseline, 1 day before the third cycle of neoadjuvant therapy, 1 day before non-surgical therapy and landmark time. All included patients will be regularly followed up for at least 5 years.
