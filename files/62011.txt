Exercise in Prostate Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn how exercise intervention affects circulating tumor cells (CTC) in men with advanced prostate cancer. The primary objective is to determine if an exercise intervention decreases CTCs in men with advanced prostate cancer. Participants will have baseline screening assessments, followed by 12 weeks of exercise intervention, and then follow-up assessments 12 weeks after the end of the exercise intervention.

This is a pilot single arm prospective study of personalized exercise training in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who are being treated with or without oral anti-androgens. The primary objective is to determine if combination of resistance and aerobic exercises lowers CTCs in men with mCRPC. Researchers will assess the rate of conversion from CTC positive to CTC negative in participants at the end of the 12 week exercise intervention. The study will enroll 20 participants onto the trial with the goal of at least 10 participants having blood drawn at both baseline and 12 weeks and completed at least 75% of the prescribed exercise sessions. Participants will undergo follow-up assessments at the end of the 12 week exercise intervention and the study team will monitor participant records for 365 days after the study completion for vital status.
