Using Tissue-based Spatial Data to Understand How Obesity-related Tumor Metabolites Fuel Prostate Cancer Progression
Evaluate the protein expression of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (LDHA) and MCT-1/-4 transporters, involved in lactate synthesis and transport, in prostate carcinoma tissues from severely overweight/obese (BMI \> 27.5) and non-severely overweight/normoweight (BMI \< 27.5) patients affected by prostate carcinoma.

ii. Characterize the immune infiltrate in the prostate carcinoma of the aforementioned patients.

iii. Assess the association between intra-tumoral lactate accumulation (using LDHA and MCT-4 protein expression levels as readouts) and alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment and/or deregulation of relevant oncogenic pathways.
