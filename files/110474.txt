Phase I/II Study of Abraxane in Recurrent and Refractory Lymphoma
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects, maximum tolerated dose, and effectiveness of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More effective and well tolerated therapies are needed to treat patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas. Nab-paclitaxel combines a chemotherapeutic agent with a protein which may increase the anticancer drug concentration in the tumor while reducing toxic effects in normal tissue and may be an effective treatment for lymphoma.

Phase I: Toxicity associated with Abraxane, 28 weeks (30 days after completion of study treatment)|Phase II: Time to progression., Response and progression will be recorded with each imaging evaluation according to the 2007 revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma by Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al. Revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma. J Clin Oncol 2007;25:579-86., 24 weeks (end of study)|Phase II: Duration of remission, 24 weeks (end of study)|Phase II: Overall survival., 3 years|Phase II: Clinical benefit (CR + PR + SD), 24 weeks (end of study)
