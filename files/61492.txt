Biomarker-oriented Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Combination With Olaparib and Paclitaxel in Gastric Cancer
\<Research Hypothesis\> The dynamics of immune systems by Olaparib and its changes by combination with immune-oncology agents will be uncovered.

The combination of Olaparib with Durvalumab with paclitaxel is tolerable and efficacious in gastric cancer.

\<Objectives\>

Primary Objectives:

To assess the effect of Durvalumab in combination with olaparib and paclitaxel on DCR (Disease control rate) in gastric cancer patients

-Disease control rate (based on RECIST v1.1)

Secondary Objective(s):

* Efficacy: overall response rate (RECIST 1.1, ir response), progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, overall survival at 6 month, overall survival at 1 year, EORTC QLQ-C30,
* Safety: toxicity (CTCAE V4.1), irAE
