Dasatinib Versus Nilotinib for Treatment Naïve Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DANIN study is a randomized, phase 3 clinical trial comparing 'head to head' Nilotinib versus Dasatinib as upfront therapy for patient with chronic myeloid leukemia. The efficacy of both drugs will be tested by measuring BCR/ABL (BCR-ABL = fusion gene from BCR (breakpoint cluster region gene/BCR gene product) and ABL (Abelson proto-oncogene)) using European Leukemia net recommendations the study will be conducted in NCCCR (National Center for Cancer Care \& Research) sample size calculations detailed in the statistic part the clinical hematologist will recruit the patients this will include consenting process inclusion and exclusion criteria the molecular pathologist will do the molecular testing the clinical research coordinator and fellows will do the CRF (Case Report Form) as well as quality of life questionnaire and applying the protocol for evaluation of cardiac evaluation Molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to assess treatment response in CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia).
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia - Chronic Phase
DRUG: Dasatinib 100 MG [Sprycel]|DRUG: Nilotinib 150mg oral capsule [Tasigna]
Number of patients with a Molecular Response Rate (MMR) at 12 Months from the baseline, Rate of MMR is defined as \<= 0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by international scale (IS), measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) which corresponds to a ≥ 3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardized baseline. BCR-ABL = fusion gene from BCR (breakpoint cluster region gene/BCR gene product) and ABL (Abelson proto-oncogene), 12 Months
Number of patients with a Durable Molecular Response Rate (MMR) from the baseline, Rate of MMR is defined as \<= 0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by international scale (IS), measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) which corresponds to a ≥ 3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardized baseline. BCR-ABL = fusion gene from BCR (breakpoint cluster region gene/BCR gene product) and ABL (Abelson proto-oncogene) Number of patients with a maintained MMR for 5 years, 12 months to 5 years|Number of patients with a Reduction in BCR-ABL Transcript Levels in both arms from the baseline, BCR-ABL ≤ 10% at 3 months BCR-ABL \< 1% at 6 months BCR-ABL ≤ 0.1% at 12 months

then MMR or better

BCR-ABL = fusion gene from BCR (breakpoint cluster region gene/BCR gene product) and ABL (Abelson proto-oncogene), 5 years|Number of patients with a Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) in both arms from the baseline, Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia positive (Ph+) cells in metaphase from bone marrow (BM) sample. (Ideally, 25 metaphases but at least 20 metaphases from a BM sample were evaluated). Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR)=0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM. A cCCyR=those in which all measurements up to at least 28 days after the initial response show an equivalent or better CCyR (Complete Cytogenetic Response)., 5 years
