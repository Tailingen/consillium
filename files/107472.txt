PLAN is a multicentre, parallel-group, blinded, randomized controlled trial of 1,602 patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Consented eligible patients will be randomized to receive an intravenous lidocaine: 1.5 mg/kg bolus with induction of general anesthesia followed by a 2.0 mg/kg/hour infusion until the end of surgery (and up to 30 minutes into recovery room). Patients in the control group will receive a placebo bolus and infusion with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution). Study medications will be prepared in blinded 50 mL syringes and labelled as per Regulatory requirements. Patients will follow up on the first 3 days after surgery, and at 3 and 12-months postoperatively to report on pain, analgesic consumption, functional, mood, and quality of life outcomes
