Intraoperative Imaging of Lymph Nodes
One-third of the global population battles cancer, with surgery being the primary treatment for localized forms. Successful treatment often hinges on the thorough removal of primary tumors and pinpointing cancerous sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). Although modern surgical imaging and fluorescent probes enhance the detection of sentinel lymph nodes using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence, their inability to precisely determine the nodes' status can result in additional surgeries, lymphedema, and a reduced quality of life for patients. Our research direction aims to harness the potential of bioinspired imaging technologies with the goal of precisely identifying SLN status and ensuring only the cancerous lymph nodes are excised during the initial procedure. To realize this objective, we're drawing inspiration from the mantis shrimp's visual system to create a single-chip multispectral camera that spans the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared spectrum. Our pioneering sensor seamlessly combines perovskite nanocrystals, optical filters, and vertically-aligned photodetectors on a single chip, enabling concurrent imaging of external NIR fluorophores and internal UV fluorescence from tumor-specific markers.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Surgical removal of breast cancer and lymph nodes
Positive lymph node detection with custom sensors, This study aims to determine the accuracy and reliability of our novel imaging technologies in identifying cancer-affected sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Initially, we will utilize the NIR fluorescence from ICG to identify the location of lymph nodes in resected ex vivo samples. Following this, the identified lymph nodes will be exposed to UV light to detect any inherent autofluorescence. Once the imaging study is completed, a pathologist will examine all the surgically removed samples to determine whether there is metastasis in the lymph nodes, thereby establishing the definitive diagnosis., The sample removed from the patient will be promptly imaged using our sensor, with the imaging process expected to last between 3 to 5 minutes for each sample.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of our two new imaging technologies (bioinspired imaging sensor and low noise imaging sensor) to detect positive sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. We will achieve this by recording fluorescence emitted by an FDA-approved fluorescent probe known as Indocyanine Green (ICG) in ex vivo resected samples. ICG is routinely used during cancer surgeries around the world because it passively accumulates in sentinel lymph nodes. Due to the bright green coloration of ICG, surgeons can visually identify the location of the sentinel lymph node, resect them and stage the patient's cancer based on pathology results. Since ICG is also fluorescent in the near infrared spectrum, our imaging sensor can locate the sentinel lymph node quicker and more accurately than when using unaided visual inspection. Once the lymph node is located using near-infrared (NIR) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG), the extracted samples will be placed on a separate table. These samples will be subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light to check for any natural autofluorescence. A strong autofluorescence indicates the sample is likely positive or metastatic, suggesting the presence of cancer cells. Subsequent histopathological analysis will further examine these samples. The findings will be used to construct a receiver operating curve, which will help in determining the accuracy of detecting cancer-positive lymph nodes using both exogenous (ICG-induced) and endogenous (natural) fluorescence with the two imaging systems.
