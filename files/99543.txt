Study on Leiomyosarcoma, Liposarcomas and Synovial Sarcoma With Trabectedin
Two arm, randomized, open-label study, to determine the best time to secondary resistance between responding patients who discontinue treatment and resumed Trabectedin at the time of progression versus patients who continued treatment until progression. T
Leiomyosarcoma|Liposarcoma|Synovial Sarcoma
DRUG: Trabectedin discontinuation|DRUG: Trabectedin continuation
Time secondary resistance to Trabectedin, Time secondary resistance to Trabectedin is the time from the first trabectedin dose to progression not amenable to treatment with Trabectedin, or death, whichever occurs first, Week 18
Overall Survival, Overall Survival is the time from the first trabectedin dose to death for any cause, month 6,month 12, month 18, month 24, months 30, month 36, month 42, month 48, month 54, month 60|Incidence of adverse event, Adverse events are evaluate from the first trabectedin dose throughout the study according to CTCAE 5.0, Week 9, week 18, week 27, week 36, week 45, week 54, week 63, week 72, week 81|Progression free survival, Time from the first trabectedin dose to time of onset of progression disease, Week 9, week 18, week 27, week 36, week 45, week 54, week 63, week 72, week 81
This is an Italian, multicenter, randomized, open-label , two arm, study, to determine the best time to secondary resistance between responding patients who discontinue treatment and resumed Trabectedin at the time of progression versus patients who continued treatment until progression. The aim is to evaluate the best clinical practice for responding patients as Trabectedin has an acceptable safety profile with no evidence of cumulative toxicity.

After signing informed consent and being assessed for eligibility criteria , eligible patients will start the trabectedin treatment.

All the patients who will complete 6 cycles of treatment without disease progression will be be randomized to continue Trabectedin versus "treatment interruption" followed by re-challenge at progression. Patients randomized to discontinue treatment will be candidate to other 6 cycles of treatment and if they do not progress, to another interruption. The treatment will be resumed again at progression for other 6 cycles and this scheme of treatment will be proposed until progression under Trabectedin.

The study will be conducted in Italy in approximately 12 centers, in order to recruit 330 evaluable patients over a 4 year period. The follow-up will last approximately 3 years.
