Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HER2/Neu Peptide GLSI-100 (GP2 + GM-CSF) in HER2/Neu Positive Subjects
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 3 study of GLSI-100 immunotherapy in HLA-A\*02 positive and HER2/neu positive subjects who are at high risk for disease recurrence and have completed both neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant standard of care therapy. Treatment consists of 6 intradermal injections, Primary Immunization Series (PIS), over the first 6 months of treatment and 5 booster intradermal injections spaced 6 months apart. A third open-label arm will explore GLSI-100 immunotherapy in non-HLA-A\*02 positive and HER2/neu positive subjects.
