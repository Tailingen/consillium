Nab-Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage IV Melanoma or Gynecological Cancers
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), cancer of the cervix, endometrium, ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneal cavity. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may stop or slow tumor growth by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving nab paclitaxel and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells than nab-paclitaxel alone.

Maximum tolerated dose (MTD, Defined as the highest dose level among those under consideration where at most 1 of 6 patients develops a dose-limiting toxicity., 28 days
Tumor response, Defined as complete response or partial response on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart. Will be assessed as the number of patients whose tumor has met the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria., Up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study entry to the documentation of disease progression., Time from study entry to the documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from study entry to death due to any cause., Time from study entry to death due to any cause, assessed up to 12 months|Incidence of adverse events (soft tissue expansion cohort), The maximum grade of each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient and the percentage of patients developing any degree of that adverse effect, as well as the percentage of patients developing a severe degree (grade 3 or higher) will be determined. Adverse Events will be defined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-malignant melanoma \[MM\]) of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel)/bevacizumab-complex (AB-complex) among patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-gynecologic \[GYN\]) of AB-complex among patients with gynecologic cancers.

III. To further assess the safety profile and anti-tumor activity of the recommended phase II dose of AB-complex for patients with previously-treated endometrial cancer IV. To further assess the safety profile and anti-tumor activity of the recommended phase II dose of AB-complex for patients with previously treated ovarian cancer

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of AB-complex among patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

II. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of AB-complex among patients with gynecologic cancers.

CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES (DOSE-ESCALATION COHORTS ONLY):

I. Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered in the context of AB-complex. II. Tumor concentrations of paclitaxel 24 hour (h) following AB-complex infusion and correlation with plasma levels.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive nab-paclitaxel/bevacizumab-complex intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patient may receive paclitaxel if supply of nab-paclitaxel is exhausted.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 12 months.
