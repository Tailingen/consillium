A Non-interventional Study (NIS) Registry for the Epidemiological and Scientific Evaluation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation Status in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer).
The primary objective of the study is to collect epidemiological data on EGFR mutation status \[M+(mutation positive), M-(mutation negative)\] in a population of predominantly Caucasian ethnicity, and to correlate EGFR mutation status with clinico-pathological characteristics (e.g. smoking status, sex, histology, etc). In particular, the study will aim to determine the frequency of EGFR M+ lung cancers in patients with clinico-pathological characteristics that are not commonly associated with EGFR mutation positivity (i.e., smokers, men, and non-adenocarcinoma).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Epidemiological data on EGFR mutation status (M+, M-) in a population of predominantly Caucasian ethnicity, Up to 2,5 years|Clinico-pathological characteristics according to mutation status, Up to 2,5 years
Pharmacoeconomic data (resource use) associated with the diagnosis and treatment of EGFR M+ patients, Up to 3,5 years|Real-life data on 1st-line treatment decisions in EGFR M+ and M-/Mx(mutation status not evaluable) patients, Up to 2,5 years|Clinical outcome data under real life clinical practice in all EGFR M+ patients up to disease progression (PFS, OS, DCR), Up to 3,5 years
