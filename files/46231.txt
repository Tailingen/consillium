Cell Therapy for CD7 Positive T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Using CD7-Specific CAR-T Cells
This is an open, single-arm, clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti CD7 CAR-T cell in the treatment of relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL).
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD7 CAR-T
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within the first one month after CD7 CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Remission Rate, Remission Rate including complete remission(CR)、CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)、partial remission(PR), No remission(NR), overall remission (OR), 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of CD7 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, percentage of CD7 CAR- T cells measured by flow cytometry method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicators:, the peak concentration of Senl-T7 CAR-T cells amplified in the peripheral blood (Cmax, detected by flow cytometry and qPCR); the time taken to reach the peak concentration (Tmax), and the persistent time of the Senl-T7 CAR-T cells in vivo in patients;, Long time|Pharmacodynamic (PD) indicators:, the pharmacodynamic change in the clearance of peripheral blood CD7+ cells and the release of the cytokines at each observation time point, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion
The CARs consist of an anti-CD7 single-chain variable fragment（scFv）, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.

The Main research objectives:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD7 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL

The Secondary research objectives:

To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of CD7 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL
