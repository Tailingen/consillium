Pancreatic Anastomosis After Duodenopancreatectomy
A national, multicenter, randomized, prospective, parallel group clinical study to evaluate two therapeutic strategies (invaginating pancreatogastric anastomosis versus Blumgart anastomosis).
Pancreatic Anastomotic Leak|Pancreatic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Blumgart Anastomosis|PROCEDURE: Pancreatogastric anastomosis.
Postoperative pancreatic fistula rate (PPF), The post-operative pancreatic fistula (PPF) rate will be measured using the definition of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) : any measurable amount of fluid from a drain placed during the operation or percutaneously, with an amylase concentration greater than three times the plasma value., 3 months
Bleeding, According to the definition of the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery. which grades the severity of bleeding according to the clinical situation, diagnosis and need for treatment., 3 months|Gastric Emptying Delay (GED), According to the definition of the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery, which establishes the existence of GED when a nasogastric tube is needed for more than 3 days or is placed from the third day of the postoperative period, as well as intolerance to an oral diet at the end of the first postoperative week., 3 months|Biliary Fistula, According to the definition of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery, which defines it as any measurable amount of fluid from a drain placed during the operation or percutaneously, with a concentration of bilirubin greater than three times the plasma value as of the third post-operative day., 3 months|Other complications., All complications that may occur during the first 90 days of the postoperative period (including the mortality rate) should be collected and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), 3 months
Background: Postoperative pancreatic fistula is currently the most frequent complications after duodenopancreatectomy. There are currently no RCT comparing two of the most frequently used method of pancreato-enteric anastomosis (invaginating pancreatogastric anastomosis versus Blumgart anastomosis)

Hypothesis: in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary tumors, performing a Blumgart (AB) anastomosis for pancreatoenteric reconstruction after duodenopancreatectomy decreases the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (PPF) compared to to pancreatogastric anastomosis.

Main goal: To comparatively evaluate the rate of PPF in patients with pancreatic and periampullary tumors undergoing cephalic duodenopancreatectomy after reconstruction with Blumgart anastomosis or pancreatogastric anastomosis.
