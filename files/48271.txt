Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Rehabilitation of Postoperative Motor Dysfunction.
This study focused on glioma patients with postoperative motor deficits, especially for patients with supplementary motor area syndrome. The investigators want to investigate whether the recovery of motor function will be accelerated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to stimulate primary motor area and supplementary motor area on the lesional hemisphere.
Glioma|Postoperative Motor Deficit
DEVICE: TMS treatment
Accelerate motor functional recovery, The ratio of motor functional recovery in patients with TMS treatment is higher than those do not receive TMS treatment and the time of motor funcitonal recovery is shorter than those do not receive., From the day of tumor resection to 3 months after tumor resection.
