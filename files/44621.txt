Sarcopenia in Older Patient With Prostate Cancer, Prevalence and Incidence After Androgen Deprivation Therapy
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men 50 years and older and mainly affets patients 75 years old.

Androgen deprivation therapy is indicatated in intermediates and high risks form of prostate cancer, in association with radiotherapy for 6 monts to 3 years. It is also indicated after surgery. Current therapies induce inhibition of sexual hormones as androgens among which testosterone. These therapies present side effects which have to be acknowledeged during the elaboration therapeutic startegies in older patients: hypogonadism induced by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) causes loss of bone mineral density, diminution of lean body mass and increase of fat body mass.

Sarcopenia is defined by a loss of muscle strength associated to a decrease in skeletal muscle mass. In addition to aging, many factors may contribute to sarcopenia as cancer and/or ADT. This cohort study aims to evaluate risk factors associated to sarcopenia prevalence and the relationship between ADT and sarcopenia incidence, in patients 70 years or older with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer
