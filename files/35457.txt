Health Opportunities and Promoters of Equitable Screening for Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to promote lung cancer screening (LCS) uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What barriers do current and former Hispanic smokers face in the identification and documentation of their smoking status?
* How can digital delivery of an educational video promote LCS uptake among current and former Hispanic smokers?

Participants will receive an educational video about lung cancer screening and complete brief, self-reported surveys afterwards.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-specific mortality in the US, and Hispanics experience worse lung cancer outcomes and die at higher rates due to advanced stage at presentation. Lung cancer screening (LCS) can save many lives through early lung cancer detection among Hispanic current and former smokers.

Still, without increasing efforts to improve smoking status disclosure and documentation and tailored interventions to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers, this underserved population will continue to demonstrate disparities in lung cancer survival. Based on prior research experience, Dr. Flores has adapted the NIMHD research framework by incorporating elements from Ford's evidence-based theoretical model to guide the following proposed study aims:

1) To elucidate barriers and facilitators to consistent identification and documentation of smoking status to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers; 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and reach of the digital delivery of an educational video to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers; 3) To explore the effect of the digital delivery of the educational video to increase interest, intent, and scheduling of LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers.

Impact: The successful completion of this research will serve as a foundation for developing novel interventions to overcome disparities and advance equity in lung cancer outcomes among Hispanics and other vulnerable populations.
