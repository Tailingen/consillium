Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound for the Evaluation of Changes in Tumor Blood Flow Surrounding HAE
The purpose of the study is to find out if a study agent called Lumason® microbubbles may be helpful for people with lesions in the liver. It is possible it may help determine an early response to radioembolization and/or help demonstrate radiation toxicity to the surrounding liver.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Lumason®
Number of Participants with Early Tumor Response, Dynamic CEUS imaging will demonstrate perfusion characteristics that will predict early tumor response to Transarterial Y90 embolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. A change in intra-tumoral arterial flow will be predictive of early response. This will be evaluated immediately following hepatic artery embolization (day 0), at 4 weeks (follow-up 1), 12 weeks (follow-up 2) and 24 weeks (follow-up 3). A modified RECIST will be used to measure early tumor response., Base line up to 24 weeks
Number of Participants with Early Signs of Radiation Induced Liver Disease (RILD), Dynamic CEUS imaging will demonstrate perfusion characteristics that will predict early signs of Radiation Induced Liver Disease (RILD) after Transarterial Y90 embolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. This will be evaluated immediately following hepatic artery embolization (day 0), at 4 weeks (follow-up 1), 12 weeks (follow-up 2) and 24 weeks (follow-up 3)., Base line up to 24 weeks
