This study evaluate the efficacy and safety of ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% on face and scalp \& 0.05% on trunk and extremities in Korean patient with actinic keratosis.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: ingenol mebutate gel 0.015%|DRUG: ingenol mebutate gel 0.05%
CC Rate of AK Lesions in the Selected Treatment Area, Complete Clearance (CC) means that clearance of all visible AK lesions in the selected treatment area and Investigator-rated actinic keratiosis(AK) lesion complete clearance (CC) rate at the selected treatment area on day 57 was analyzed., at day 57
Percentage Change of the Number of AK Lesions in the Selected Treatment Area, Percentage change from baseline in the number of actinic keratiosis(AK) lesions in the selected treatment area on Day 57 was analyzed., Baseline and Day 57|Sustained CC Rate in CC Group, Sustained Complete Clearance means that Complete Clearance was maintained until Month 6 in complete clearance (CC) group and sustained complete clearance(CC) rate at month 6 for complete clearance(CC) group was analyzed., at 6 months|Recurrence Rate in CC Group, Recurrence rate in complete clearance(CC) group was analyzed., at 6 months|Percentage Change of the Number of AK Lesions in the Selected Treatment Area of CC Group, Percentage change from baseline in the number of actinic keratiosis(AK) lesions at Month 6 in the selected treatment area in complete clearance(CC) Group was analyzed., at 6 months from baseline|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (Skindex-29), Skindex-29 is a self-administered QoL questionnaire comprised of 29 items scored on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=all the time) covering 3 domains: emotional (10 items), symptomatic (7 items), and functional (12 items), with domain scores ranging from 0 to 40, 28, and 48, respectively. Lower scores for each of the domains represents a better Quality of life., at 29 and 57 days from baseline|Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), Participants personally completed the tool to evaluate satisfaction with drug treatment. It consisted of 4 areas of Effectiveness, side effect, convenience, and global satisfaction, with a total of 14 sub-items. The full mark is 100, and it is divided in four stages as follows.

* Very good: 76 -100 score
* Good: 51-75 score
* Not bad: 26-50 score
* Bad: 0-25 score Scores for each area ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating that fewer side effects had occurred and greater treatment satisfaction., at 29 and 57 days from baseline|Cosmetic Outcomes Assessment (COA), The investigator rated the subject's Cosmetic Outcomes Assessment(COA) using 5 grades (Very good, Good, No change, Bad, Very bad), and results were as follows., at 29 and 57 days from baseline|Time to Relapse in CC Group, Time to relapse in complete clearance(CC) Group was analyzed. Median survival time with 95% confidence interval was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method., at 6 months
Medication for Actinic Keratosis, The count of participants in complete clearance(CC) group and Non-CC group who administered medication for actinic keratosis on the selected treatment area after Day 57 was collected., from 57 days to 6 months|Non-Drug Treatment/Surgery for Actinic Keratosis, The count of participants in complete clearance(CC) group and Non-CC group who received non-drug treatment/surgery for actinic keratosis on the selected treatment area after Day 57 was collected., from 57 days to 6 months
The mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate for actinic keratosis(AK) treatment involves a rapid induction of necrosis followed by neutrophil-mediated, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of residual lesion. As the ingenol mebutate infiltrates the cell membrane, it increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration which leads to mitochondrial swelling and disruption of mitochondrial membrane within hours. The release of intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ into the cytoplasm leads to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a rapid induction of cell death by necrosis. This process occurs within 1 hour of application, which explains why the treatment period requires only 2 or 3 days of treatment. As the next phase, the cellular necrosis is accompanied by a robust inflammatory response through the release of proinflammatory cytokines from skin cells and tumor cells undergoing necrosis. The release of these proinflammatory cytokines into the dysplastic cells mediates the process of neutrophil recruitment through paracrine signaling and activation of endothelial cells. Here, the neutrophil mediated ADCC occurs, where activated neutrophils attach to the fragment, crystallized (Fc) parts of antibodies of dysplastic cells and destroys the residual dysplastic epidermal cells. In this way, the ingenol mebutate eradicates any residual tumor cells and prevents recurrence of actinic keratosis.As described above, the rapid effect and dual mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate gel allows not only a short-course therapy (2 or 3 days of application) for the elimination of actinic keratosis but also, the benefit for eradication of any residual lesions preventing the recurrence and the progression of AK into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
