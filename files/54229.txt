The Role of the Free/Pedunculated Flap in Total Laryngectomy After (Chemo-)Radiotherapy Failure for Laryngeal Carcinoma: Impact on the Risk of Pharyngocutaneous Fistula (PCF)
Multicenter, prospective, randomized study aimed at evaluating the difference in risk of PCF after salvage laryngectomy in two groups of patients: one cohort treated with Total Laryngectomy (LT) with primary suture, a second group treated with LT and reinforcement by flap positioning with onlay technique (PMM, ALT)
Larynx Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Primary suture
questionnaires for evaluation of the quality of life, Questionnaires will be administered to the patient for the subjective evaluation of the quality of life in relation to vocal rehabilitation obtained through voice prosthesis or esophageal voice (SECEL questionnaire)., 30 months
Identification of risk factors, Identification of risk factors related to the formation of pharyngocutaneous fistulas after salvage total laryngectomy, 4 months|Evaluation of swallowing function, Evaluation of swallowing function assessed using the SOAL questionnaire, 4 months|Evaluation of vocal rehabilitation, Evaluation of vocal rehabilitation using the SECEL questionnaire, 4 months
Patients, once eligibility has been verified, will then be randomized (1:1) to one of the following groups: Gruop 1: STL primary suture. Group 2: STL primary suture + onlay flap Patients in both groups will then undergo surgery STL with primary suture; in those of the second group, in addition, the positioning of a free/pedunculated covering flap will also be carried out with the onlay technique. 4 months after surgery, questionnaires will be administered to the patient for the subjective evaluation of the quality of life in relation to vocal rehabilitation obtained through voice prosthesis or esophageal voice (SECEL questionnaire) and swallowing rehabilitation (SOAL questionnaire). Demographic and preoperative data will be collected, data relating to pre-(chemo-)radiotherapy and pre-STL clinical staging, as well as the interval in days between the end of (chemo-)radiotherapy and surgery, perioperative data, type of eventual unilateral or bilateral laterocervical lymph node emptying, the type of pharyngotomy suture, the type of flap possibly used, the packaging of the tracheoesophageal fistula for positioning the voice prosthesis, the definitive histological examination.

The patient must undergo a radiological examination for loco-regional and distant staging before the STL (CT or MRI) and a biopsy demonstrating the recurrence/persistence of the disease.
