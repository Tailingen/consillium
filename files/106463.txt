Effect of Ramadan Fasting on Ovulation and Insuline Resistance in Patients With PCOS
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a heterogeneous clinical presentation comprising reproductive (hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity, anovulation, infertility, pregnancy complications), metabolic \[insulin resistance (IR), increased type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors\] and psychological features (worsened quality of life and increased anxiety and depression) Whether prolonged fasting during Ramadan breaks the insulin resistance state of polycystic ovarian syndrome and subsequently improve the ovulation and spontaneous pregnancy will happen without ovarian stimulation.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
spontaneous ovulation measured by midluteal progesterone, Ovulation will be monitored by the Progesterone level on 22nd day of first cycle after 30 days of prolonged daily Fasting (Ramadan)., one month
clinical pregnancy, We will record any pregnancy will happened in the next 4 months after Fasting without any ovulation induction., four months|fasting glucose/insuline ratio, Insulin resistance (IR) measuring: fasting 8 hours. Plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting insulin (FIN) will be measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. The ratio of glucose/insulin represents the degree of IR, one month|Plasma adiponectin, Plasma adiponectin will be measured before and after 30 days fasting, one month|plasma resistin, Plasma resistin will be measured before and after 30 days fasting, one month|plasma gherlin, Plasma gherlin will be measured before and after 30 days fasting, one month
Question of the study:

The question is raised whether prolonged fasting during Ramadan breaks the insulin resistance state of polycystic ovarian syndrome and improve the metabolic syndrome does prolonged fasting decrease glucose level, insulin level, insulin resistance markers such as adipokines and subsequently improve ovarian function and causes spontaneous ovulation.
