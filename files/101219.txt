Infantile Hemangioma With Minimal or Arrested Growth : Epidemiology, Clinical Characteristics and Evolution
Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common vascular tumor of infancy, characterized by its clinical history. Absent at birth or present under the form of a premonitory mark, they display a rapid proliferative phase starting in the first weeks of life. Then, after a plateau phase, they slowly involute. However, a subtype of IH named "abortive", "minimal or arrested growth", "reticular" or "telangiectatic" hemangioma differs from typical IH because it doesn't have a proliferative component, or only a minimal one. This subtype of hemangioma has been recently described and data are lacking regarding its proportion among infantile hemangioma and its differences with "classic" infantile hemangioma. The aim of this study is to estimate the proportion of abortive hemangioma among infantile hemangioma. Also, the investigators aim to compare the clinical characteristics of "classic" infantile hemangiomas and abortive hemangiomas. Lastly, investigators wished to study the evolution of abortive hemangioma.
