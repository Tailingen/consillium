PS-341 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have metastatic malignant melanoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die
Recurrent Melanoma|Stage IV Melanoma
DRUG: bortezomib|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Proportion of patients who are progression-free, Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated., 18 weeks
Objective response is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in terms of tumor/lesion size and change, Up to 2 years|Overall survival, The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., Time from registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the progression-free survival at 18 weeks and overall survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma treated with PS-341.

II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Correlate p27 levels in tumor tissue with objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2 years after registration.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
