Perioperative Nutritional Optimization in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
To determine whether nutritional optimization in head and neck cancer patients undergoing major surgery will decrease post-operative wound complications. The Investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplementation with Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery (AR) will decrease the rate of wound complications after surgery

The purpose of this study is to determine whether nutritional optimization in head and neck cancer patients undergoing major surgery will decrease post-operative wound complications. It is likely that many head and neck cancer patients suffer from sarcopenia, and this contributes to many wound complications, including wound infection, dehiscence, fistula formation, and free flap tissue loss. The Investigators hypothesize that nutritional supplementation with Nestle Impact Advanced Recovery (AR) will decrease the rate of wound complications after surgery
