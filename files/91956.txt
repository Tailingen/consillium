Prospective Multicenter Observational Study of Atezolizumab Combination Therapy in Lung Cancer (J-TAIL-2)
This is a multi-center observational study of atezolizumab combination therapy in patients with unresectable, advanced and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) or extensive disease small cell lung cancer(ED-SCLC). 800 patients in NSCLC cohort and 400 patients in ED-SCLC cohort will be enrolled in this trial to assess the efficacy and safety of this combination.
