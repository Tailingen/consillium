Study of Pedi-cRIB: Mini-Hyper-CVD With Condensed Rituximab, Inotuzumab Ozogamicin and Blinatumomab (cRIB) for Relapsed Therapy for Pediatric With B-Cell Lineage Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
To learn if cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (called mini hyper-CVD) in combination with intrathecal (delivered into the spine) chemotherapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, cytarabine) and compressed rituximab, blinatumomab, and inotuzumab ozogamicin (called cRIB) can help to control the disease.

DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Blinatumomab|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Mercaptopurine|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Inotuzumab ozogamicin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

--To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the sequential combination of mini-hyper-CVD with inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab and rituximab in relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, based upon the complete response rate (CR).

Secondary Objectives:

* To summarize efficacy per response rate, overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate.
* To evaluate the safety of this combination.

Exploratory Objectives:

--To summarize associations between genomic alterations in ALL (current biomarker expression of the disease) with relation to the incidence of transition to HSCT in patients with PR or stable disease (SD) after the induction cycle(s).
