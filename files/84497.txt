Insulin Resistance and Androgen Deprivation Therapy
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy amongst men in United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with long acting gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists is routinely used as adjuvant therapy in intermediate and high risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. Since ADT induces insulin resistance and diabetes, it is important that cellular and molecular effects of ADT are investigated to define precisely the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Pioglitazone, a known insulin sensitizer, may provide amelioration of insulin resistance in these patients.
Prostate Cancer|Insulin Resistance
DRUG: Pioglitazone 30 mg|DRUG: placebo tablet
insulin sensitivity, The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a difference in insulin sensitivity as measured by whole body glucose uptake during clamps after treatment with pioglitazone as compared to placebo., 6 months
Insulin signaling (Insulin receptor substrate expression in fat tissue), A secondary endpoint for the study will be comparison of the relative change from baseline in insulin signaling after pioglitazone or placebo., 6 months
Investigators plan to conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 44 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who are receiving ADT with long acting GnRH agonist (study group). Study subjects will undergo insulin clamp, subcutaneous fat biopsy, muscle biopsy, have a blood sample taken and fibroscan performed prior to randomization of study drug. They will then be randomized to 30 mg pioglitazone or placebo tablet daily for 6 months. Blood samples will be drawn 2 and 4 months following the initiation of the study drug. The final study visit will be at 6 months. Subjects will undergo clamp, fat biopsy, muscle biopsy, blood sampling, fibroscan and will be discharged from the study.
