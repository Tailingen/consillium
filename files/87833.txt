This a first-in-human phase I/II study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of VLS-1488 monotherapy and consists of two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

Dose Escalation will examine the safety and tolerability of VLS-1488 in different solid tumor types at various dose levels through a series of Dose Escalation and Backfill Cohorts to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and to select dose levels for Dose Expansion. The criteria for dose (de-)escalation will be based on a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design.

Dose Expansion will examine the safety, tolerability, Drug Drug Interaction (DDI) risk, Food Effect (FE) and preliminary efficacy of VLS-1488 in different tumor types and/or dose levels of interest through various expansion cohorts.

VLS-1488 will be given orally in 28-day cycles. Dosing will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or other stopping criteria are met.
