Multidisciplinary Approach to Breast Cancer Through the Study of Altered Transcriptomic and Immune Accompanied by the Identification of Extractable Markers From the Radiodiagnostic Bioimaging
Prospective observational study for onco-immunologic characterization and by bioimaging of breast neoplastic tissue of patients operated for breast cancer
Breast Cancer Patients

Multiparametric flow cytometry analyses of Custer of Differentiation (CD) proteins expression on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, The following phase of the study aims to go to evaluate the immunology of breast cancer patients compared with the control. In particular we will perfome an accurate characterization in flow cytometry of the cells present in the peripheral blood and of the immune component infiltrating the tumor (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes). The different components of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes will be assessed using the following antibodies: CD45 , CD8, CD4,CD3, HLA-DR, CD19 , CD 326 (EpCAM) ,CD56 , CD14 and CD16., 1-24 months|Analysis of gene expression profiles of cancer cells, The following area of study is focused on the study by molecular biology of samples of cancerous and healthy tissue that will be possible to obtain from the subjects participating in the study. For that phase, the type of instrumentation will be determined according to the amount of nucleic acids extracted from the tissues. In fact, samples that will allow recovery of high amounts of RNA and with a good degree of purity will be able to be used for studies carried out with next generation sequencing such as, for example, Ion Torrent S5. In the case of samples in which the RNA is difficult to extract or of low quality, methods such as real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in multiplex mode, 1-24 months|Extraction of features from radiological images to be used as biomarkers., Radiological images from High-field MRI, multilayer CT, hybrid systems such as PET-CT and PET-MRI will be use to extract quantitative parameters of the lesion and the other structures of interest. An automatic segmentation , or alternatively, a manual segmentation by an experienced radiologist or experienced nuclear physician will be performe., 1-36 months|Bioinformatics analysis, The correlations between the cytofluorimetric characterization of TILs and the quantitative parameters extracted from radiological images will be performed using different software such as Graphpad or ER softwares., 37-48 months
