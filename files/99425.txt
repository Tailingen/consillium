The Efficacy of Shear-wave Elastography-guided Aspiration and Biopsy for Diagnosis in Lung Tumor
To use the shear-wave elastography to assist the transthoracic ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy of peripheral lung tumor

1. To identify the intra-tumor heterogeneity of elasticity
2. To increase the diagnostic yield in ultrasound-guided transthoracic biopsy of subpleural pulmonary tumor
