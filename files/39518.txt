The Efficacy and Safety of Chidamide, Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Combination With Pegaspargase Versus DDGP in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed, Stage III to IV Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma
A multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide, anti-PD1 antibody, and pegaspargase versus dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pegaspargase (DDGP) in the treatment of newly diagnosed, stage III to IV extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.
Extranodal Natural Killer T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: chidamide, anti-PD1 antibody, and pegaspargase|DRUG: DDGP
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Complete response rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria and 2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy., At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Overall response rate, Percentage of participants with overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria and 2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy., At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Overall survival, Overall survival in the overall study population was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. Reported is the percentage of participants with event., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., From enrollment to study completion, a maximum of 4 years|Percentage of Participants Achieving Meaningful Improvement in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a health-related quality of life questionnaire. A higher score indicates better quality of life, with changes of 5 to 10 points considered to be a minimally important difference to participants., Baseline (pre-dose [Hour 0] on Cycle1 Day1), Cycle3 Day 1, end of treatment (up to Month 6), every 3 months 1st year, every 6 months 2nd year, and 12 months thereafter up to data cut-off, up to approximately 4 years (cycle length = 21 days)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide, anti-PD1 antibody, and pegaspargase versus DDGP in the treatment of newly diagnosed, stage III to IV extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to chidamide, anti-PD1 antibody, and pegaspargase or DDGP regimen.

Patients in chidamide, anti-PD1 antibody, and pegaspargase group will receive 6 cycles of pegaspargase 2500IU/m2 intramuscularly on day1, anti-PD1 antibody 200mg intravenously on day 2, chidamide 30mg biw orally, every 21 days. Patients in DDGP group will receive 6 cycles of pegaspargase 2500IU/m2 intramuscularly on day1, cisplatin 20mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 4, dexamethasone 15mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, gemcitabine 800mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8, every 21 days.
