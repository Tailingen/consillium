Safety and Efficacy of Trastuzumab as Part of Breast Cancer Treatment Regimen
This is a prospective, Phase IV, multi-center, single arm, open-label, interventional study to evaluate the safety of trastuzumab for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2)-positive node positive or high risk node negative breast cancer participants with regimen consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel (AC-TH Regimen) or a regimen consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin (TCH Regimen) in Indian population.

Clinically Significant Changes in Cardiac Function As Determined by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Measurements Using Echocardiography, LVEF assessments were performed every three months (four cycles) using echocardiogram, Baseline to every 4 cycles up to Cycle 21 (AC-TH), every 4 cycles up to Cycle 17 (TCH) (each cycle is 21 days), at study treatment completion (12 months post baseline) at 6 month (18 months post baseline) and 12 month follow-up (24 months post baseline)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during the study were also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to approximately 5 years and 10 months
Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as time from the date of first study treatment to the date of local, regional or distant recurrence, contra-lateral breast cancer or death due to any cause. Local, regional or distant recurrence, and contra-lateral breast cancer was assessed by combination of physical examination, mammography and pelvic examination., The date of first study treatment to the date of local, regional or distant recurrence, contra-lateral breast cancer or death due to any cause within 12 months from the last dose of Trastuzumab for every participant|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as time from the date of first study treatment until date of death, regardless of the cause of death., Time from the date of first study treatment until date of death, regardless of the cause of death within 12 months from the last dose of Trastuzumab for every participant. The follow up period was 52 weeks from the last dose of treatment in both arms.
