- IKF/AIO-QUINTIS - Evaluating Fruquintinib in Combination With Tislelizumab in Microsatellite Stable / Proficient Mismatch Repair (MSS/pMMR) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Without Active Liver Metastases
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter phase II investigating the therapy of Fruquintinib in combination with Tislelizumab in patients with MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer without liver metastases.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Trifluridine/tipiracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab
To evaluate the efficacy of Fruquintinib in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor Tislelizumab in MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer without liver metastases., Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization until date of progression acc. to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., up to 54 month
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization until date of death due to any cause., up to 54 month|Objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR), defined as proportion of patients achieving complete or partial response (CR/PR) acc. to RECIST v1.1., up to 54 month|Disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR), defined as proportion of patients achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) acc. to RECIST v1.1., up to 54 month|Duration of response, Duration of response (DoR), defined as time from response initiation (when either CR or PR is first determined) to disease progression acc. to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., up to 54 month|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Fruquintinib in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor Tislelizumab in MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer without liver metastases., Assessment of safety of the treatment as determined by the incidence, nature, causality, frequency, timing, and severity of adverse events using NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 54 month|To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data of Fruquintinib in combination with the PD 1 inhibitor Tislelizumab in MSS/pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer without liver metastases., Assessment of HRQoL during treatment and follow-up using EORTC QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires., up to 54 month
Exploratory Translational Objectives, To correlate analysis between selected blood (such as ctDNA, chemokines/cytokines and metabolites) and stool (microbiota composition and metabolites) parameters and clinical data as well as dietary information to identify molecular biomarkers predictive for tumor response and survival., up to 54 month
Participants eligible for this trial will be randomized 1:1 into one of the two arms (Arm A and Arm B) stratified by: I) -Previous anti-angiogenic therapy (yes vs. no), II) BRAF/RAS mutation status (wildtype vs. mutation) or III) History of liver metastases (never vs. prior but treated).

Patients in Arm A (experimental arm) will receive Fruquintinib (orally, 5 mg once a day, at day 1-21 of each 28-day cycle \[Q4W\]) plus Tislelizumab (i.v., 400 mg, at day 1 of each 42-day cycle \[Q6W\]).

Patients in Arm B (control arm) will receive Trifluridine/tipiracil (orally, 35 mg/m2 twice a day, day 1-5 and day 8-12 of each 28-day cycle \[Q4W\]) plus Bevacizumab (i.v., 5 mg/kg, at day 1 of each 14-day cycle \[Q2W\]).

The treatment will be performed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patients' request, or end of protocol-defined treatment time (maximum of 15 months).

All patients will be followed up for a maximum of 18 months after last patient in or until death, withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up, whatever occurs first.
