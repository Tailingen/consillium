A Study of Mavorixafor in Combination With Ibrutinib in Participants With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) Whose Tumors Express Mutations in MYD88 and CXCR4
The primary objective of the study is to establish a pharmacologically active dose of mavorixafor in combination with ibrutinib based on pooled safety, clinical response, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to select the recommended dose for a randomized registrations trial.

This is an intrapatient dose-escalation study. Three dose levels of mavorixafor will be explored: 200 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) (dose level 1), 400 mg QD (dose level 2), and 600 mg QD (dose level 3). Ibrutinib will be administered at its labeled dose for participants with WM, 420 mg orally QD. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days.
