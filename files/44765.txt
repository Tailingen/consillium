A Study to Investigate the Disposition of Radio-labeled AVE8062 Compound Administered as a 30-minute IV Infusion to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the excretion balance and systemic exposure of radioactivity after intravenous infusion of \[14C\]-AVE8062 to humans
* To determine the pharmacokinetics of AVE8062 and RPR258063 and their contribution to overall exposure
* To collect samples to determine the metabolic pathways of AVE8062 and identify the chemical structures of the main metabolites

Secondary Objective:

* To assess the safety profile of the drug
Neoplasms, Malignant
DRUG: Ombrabulin (AVE8062)
Percentage of radioactive dose excreted in urine, feces and expired air, 3 weeks (end of cycle 1) or 30 days after the first dose|Concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of total radioactivity in whole blood and plasma; blood over plasma concentration ratios; Concentration-time profile and PK parameters of AVE8062 and RPR258063 in plasma, 3 weeks (end of cycle 1) or 30 days after the first dose
Safety assessment based on Adverse events reporting, laboratory tests according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC) v3.0 grade scaling, 3 weeks (end of cycle 1) or 30 days after the first dose
The duration of the study for each patient will include approximately 4 weeks of a screening phase prior to first infusion of study drug, 21-day study treatment cycles and end of treatment visit. The patient can continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient's refusal of further treatment.
