SLV-154 Treatment of Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SLV-154 across a range of dose levels when administered to subjects with metastatic solid tumors.

A Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with a target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 27% and an estimated maximum sample size of \~70 subjects will be used to guide the dose escalation and determine the recommended dosing regimen (RDR) of SLV-154.

SLV-154 will be administered intravenously (IV) in repeated 3-week cycles. Treatment will continue until progressive disease or discontinuation.
