Brain Irradiation and Tremelimumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab with brain radiation therapy can help treat this type of breast cancer that has spread to the brain.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Brain radiotherapy or Stereotactic Radiosurgery|DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: HER2 directed therapy|DRUG: Durvalumab
Progression Free Survival (irPFS), will be defined as the time from the first dose of tremelimumab until death or progressive disease, as measured by irRC. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 12 week
Participants Assessed for Toxicity Using the NCI CTCAE 4.0, safety profile assessed with regular physical examination and toxicity assessment using the NCI CTCAE 4.0. Subjects will be followed with regular radiation oncology assessments as per the standard of care., 1 year
A Simon 2-stage single-arm design (n=17) will be employed to evaluate for preliminary efficacy. A maximum of 17 subjects will be accrued to the efficacy arm. After the first 3 patients are enrolled in the efficacy arm, a 6 week enrollment hold will be conducted in order to ensure safety before additional patients are enrolled. An interim assessment will then occur after the first 9 subjects have enrolled, and the accrual to this arm will proceed only if a pre-specified futility threshold is met. Patients not requiring continuation of HER2 directed therapy, such as trastuzumab, will be enrolled in this arm.
