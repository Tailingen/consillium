Research of Double-positive Circulating Cells (Tumor Marker / CD45+) in Several Types of Metastatic Cancers
A prospective, proof-of-concept pilot study in patients with metastatic cancers (9 types of cancers are studied) treated at the IUCT-O or possibly in other institutions. Eligible patients will be selected and informed of this study during a medical consultation for their cancer by medical oncologists. Then, with the patient's consent and before the start of anti-cancer treatment (whatever the line), a blood sample will be taken to detect DP-circulating cells by 2 different methods of analysis.

Each patient will participate in the study for one day. The methods of analysis will be: flow cytometry for all patients and either Parsotix® or CellSearch® depending on the type of cancer.

450 patients will be enrolled in total.
Urothelial Carcinoma|Renal Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Adenocarcinoma of Endometrium|Cutaneous Melanoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)|Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumor|Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor|Upper Aerodigestive Tract Carcinoma|Cervical Carcinoma
OTHER: For each enrolled patient, the sample described below will be collected as specific intervention intended for research purposes:
Rate of patients presenting blood circulating DP cells detected by at least one of the two tested techniques (Flow Cytometry/ CellSearch® or Parsortix® according to the type of tumor), It is defined as the ratio of number of patients for whom DP cells were detected (by at least 1 of the 2 techniques) by the total number of patients., 1 year after the Last Patient Last Visit
Rate of patients presenting blood circulating DP cells detected by each method of analysis (Flow Cytometry and CellSearch® or Parsortix® according to the tumor type), It is defined as the ratio of the number of patients presenting DP cells (detected by the concerned technique) by the total number of patients, 1 year after the Last Patient Last Visit
