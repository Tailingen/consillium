Non-randomized Safety Study With Bortezomib/Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Lymphoma
The promising activity of Bortezomib as single agent in low grade lymphoma patients in small studies has led to a number of larger multicenter trials with Bortezomib in combination with Rituximab in mantle-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma.
Lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: VELCADE
To demonstrate a statistical benefit in overall response rate (ORR) of the Bortezomib/Rituximab association in this study 3/13 or fewer responses are observed during the first stage then the trail is stopped early, 1 year
If 12/43 or fewer responses are observed by the end of the trail, then no further investigation of this regimen is warranted, 4 years
This is a open label, non randomized, phase II , multicenter, prospective trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of bortezomib and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory rituximab na√Øve or sensitive indolent non-follicular and mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite of the availability of treatment for this disease, this study is justified because no known therapies are really curative and it is necessary to look for new treatment options to improve the clinical outcome and prognosis of relapsed indolent lymphoma. This study is designed for patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cells transplantation.
