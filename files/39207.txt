Zidovudine, Interferon Alfa-2b, PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b in Patients With HTLV-I Associated Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) can cause cancer. Zidovudine is an antiviral drug that acts against the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Giving zidovudine, interferon alfa-2b, and PEG-interferon alfa-2b together may stimulate the immune system and slow down or keep the cancer cell from growing.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving zidovudine together with interferon alfa-2b and PEG-interferon alfa-2b works in treating patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Number of Patients Achieving Clinical Response to Protocol Therapy Who Lack IRF-4 and/or c-Rel Expression., Number of patients achieving clinical response (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) who lack interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4) or c-Rel biomarker expression. Treatment response was assessed according to the International Consensus Review's adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) consensus report by Tsukasaki et al published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) in 2009.

For imaging, Cheson criteria was used to assess response:

* Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all clinical, microscopic, and radiographic evidence of disease. All lymph nodes regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm), and previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm. In addition, abnormally elevated peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \< 4 x 10\^9 /L.
* Partial response (PR): ≥ 50% reduction in measurable disease and abnormal lymphocyte count in peripheral blood.
* CR or PR had to persist for a period of at least 4 weeks., Up to 12 months post-initiation of protocol therapy|Presence of Minimal Residual Disease at 3 and 6 Months of Maintained Remission and at 1 Year Post Initiation of Therapy, Number of participants achieving complete response (CR) with minimal residual disease at 3, 6 and 12 months post-initiation of protocol therapy. Treatment response was assessed according to the International Consensus Review's adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) consensus report by Tsukasaki et al published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) in 2009.

Investigation of whether AZT functions as an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) in vivo by analyzing serially collected leukemic samples during the first 48 hours of treatment with AZT only. The investigators will report the number of participants exhibiting NF-kB inhibition upon treatment with AZT in vivo and correlate with response using two-sample t-test., During 48 hours of first AZT therapy|The Effect of Valproic Acid Therapy on Persistence of Clonal Disease in Patients Who Achieve Clinical Remission, Number of participants achieving a molecular remission after starting valproic acid as evidenced by disappearance of T-cell clonality as measured by gene rearrangement studies using multiplex PCR, 3, 6 and 12 months.
Failure-free Survival (FFS), Failure-free survival is the elapsed time from the date of initiation of study treatment until date of documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause. For patients alive and free of relapse or progression, follow-up time was censored at the last documented date of failure-free status., From date of treatment initiation until date of documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is the elapsed time from the date of initiation of study treatment until date of death from any cause. In the absence of death, the follow-up was censored at date of last contact., From date of treatment initiation until date of death, assessed up to 5 years
OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Induction therapy: Patients receive zidovudine IV twice daily on days 1-14, and recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV twice daily on days 3-14. Patients achieving clinical complete response (CR) proceed to part 1 maintenance therapy; patients achieving partial response (PR) receive another 7 days of zidovudine and recombinant interferon alfa-2b and then proceed to part 1 maintenance therapy.
* Part 1 maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral zidovudine twice daily and PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) once weekly, beginning on day 14 or 21 and continue to day 60. Patients are evaluated after completion of part 1 maintenance therapy and proceed to part 2 maintenance therapy.
* Part 2 maintenance therapy: Patients achieving CR with undetectable clonal disease proceed to group A; patients achieving CR with minimal residual disease (by PCR) or PR proceed to group B.

  * Group A: Patients receive oral zidovudine twice daily and PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  * Group B: Patients receive oral zidovudine twice daily and PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC once weekly for 12 weeks and undergo reevaluation. Patients in continued CR with minimal residual disease or stable PR receive oral valproic acid twice daily, PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC once weekly, and oral zidovudine twice daily for 6 months. At that point (month 9) patients with no detectable clonal disease continue their previous treatment, while patients with minimal residual disease receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC and oral zidovudine twice daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Blood samples are collected at baseline, days 1 and 2, and months 3, 6, and 12 for protein, genomic DNA, and RNA analysis. Baseline molecular characteristics of the tumor and tumor response to treatment is assessed.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
