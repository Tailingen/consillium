Comparison of Image Quality Between "Double Low Dose" Liver CT and Standard Liver CT
In patients with malignancies, contrast-enhanced abdominal CT (hereafter abdominal CT) plays an important role in detecting carcinoma recurrence and assessing treatment response. In this study, we aim to investigate whether such a "double low" dose CT is feasible in patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer using a vendor-agnostic artificial intelligence-based noise reduction and contrast enhancement software.

lesion conspicuity on portal venous phase, qualitative analysis of lesion conspicuity on portal venous phase on five-point scale (higher score indicates better conspicuity).

Lesion conspicuity is compared between the two arms., 6 months after primary study completion.
