Efficacy of Loco-regional Treatment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prior to Living Donor Liver Transplantation in Egypt
This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of loco-regional treatment prior Living Donor Liver Transplantation in patients with HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Living Donor Liver Transplantation
PROCEDURE: loco regional therapies for HCC
Radiological Response ( complete / partial / tumour progression)in the Radiology (CT/ MRI) before transplantation, the success of loco-regional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in term of radiological complete or partial response in the last spiral triphasic abdominal CT and /or MRI before transpalantation, 3 months
the degree of accuracy between the last CT/ MRI and the pathology of explant in term of number , size and ablation (complete necrosis ) for HCC, 1. presence of viable tumour tissue in the explant pathology,
2. mictro vascular invasion
3. capsular or lymph node invasion the degree of accuracy between the last CT/ MRI and the pathology of explant, 3 months
50 patients received LDLT at Ain Shams Centre for Organ Transplantation (ASCOT) over 1 year of whom data of 29 HCC patients were analyzed. Twenty patients met the Milan criteria (68.97%) \& 4 (13.8%) were beyond Milan but met UCSF criteria and 5 were exceeding UCSF criteria (17.2%).All patients underwent preoperative LRTs, The protocol of bridging/down staging, methods, duration of follow up, the number of the patients who were successfully down-staged before LT and their outcomes after LT were recorded.
