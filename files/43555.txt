A Study of CDX-1140 (CD40) as Monotherapy or in Combination in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is a study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for CDX-1140 (CD40 antibody), either alone or in combination with CDX-301 (FLT3L), pembrolizumab, or chemotherapy and to further evaluate its tolerability and efficacy in expansion cohorts once the MTD is determined.

Safety and Tolerability of CDX-1140 as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The rates of drug-related adverse events will be summarized and maximum tolerated dose will be determined., From first dose through 30 days after last dose
Objective Response Rate, The percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed complete response or partial response by evaluation criteria in solid tumors for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST; for solid tumor patients) and the lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC; for lymphoma patients)., Every 8-12 weeks, starting with first dose until disease progression, assessed up to approximately 1-3 years.|Clinical benefit rate, The percentage of patients who achieve best response of confirmed CR or PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least four months, Every 8-12 weeks, starting with first dose until disease progression, assessed up to approximately 1-3 years|Duration of Response, The interval from which measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, First occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death (up to approximately 1-3 years)|Progression-free survival, The time from start of study drug to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, From first dose to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 1-3 years)|Overall survival, The time from start of study drug to death, The time from start of study drug to death from any cause (up to approximately 1-3 years)|Immunogenicity evaluation, Serum samples will be obtained for assessment of human anti-CDX-1140 and anti-CDX-301 antibodies, Prior to each dose of study treatment and at treatment discontinuation, up to approximately 1-3 years|Pharmacokinetic evaluation, CDX-1140 and CDX-301 concentrations will be measured, Prior to each study treatment, multiple timepoints after each study treatment, and at treatment discontinuation up to approximately 1-3 years
This study will determine the MTD of CDX-1140 while also evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CDX-1140 alone (Part 1) or in combination with CDX-301 (Part 2), pembrolizumab (Part 3), or chemotherapy (Part 4) in patients with cancer.

Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of several dose levels of CDX-1140. The dose-escalation part of the study will test the safety profile of CDX-1140, alone or in combination with CDX-301, pembrolizumab or chemotherapy and determine which dose(s) of CDX-1140 will be studied in the expansion portions of the study.

All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
