Retrospective Study to Describe the Real-world Treatment Patterns and Associated Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostates Cancer
This is a multi-country, multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study planned to include patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, who have received at least 1 line of treatment (LOT) in the mCRPC setting, and have 12 months of follow-up data available.

This is a multi-country, multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study planned to include patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, who have received at least 1 line of treatment (LOT) in the mCRPC setting, and have 12 months of follow-up data available.To describe the real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCRPC

The data will be collected retrospectively between the date of diagnosis of mCRPC (index date) and the end of follow-up, i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or the date of data extraction, whichever is the earliest. The data on different types of treatment received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics, and healthcare utilization will be extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or deceased) into a centrally designed electronic data capture system. For the exploratory end point on real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCSPC, data on different types of treatment received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics will be retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or deceased) into a centrally designed electronic data capture system.
