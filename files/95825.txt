Immunogenicity and Safety of Co-immunization With Cecolin and Hecolin
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of co-immunization with recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent (Types 16,18) vaccine (Escherichia coli) and Hepatitis E vaccine (Escherichia coli)
Human Papilloma Virus Infection Type 16|Human Papilloma Virus Infection Type 18|Hepatitis E Virus Infection

evaluate the concentration of IgG antibodies to HPV-16, Detect the level of IgG antibodies to HPV-16 at 7 month to determine whether group A is non-inferior to group B, At 7 months after first dose|evaluate the concentration of IgG antibodies to HPV-18, Detect the level of IgG antibodies to HPV-18 at 7 month to determine whether group A is non-inferior to group B, At 7 months after first dose|evaluate the concentration of IgG antibodies to HEV, detect the level of IgG antibodies to HEV at 7 month to determine whether group A is non-inferior to group C, At 7 months after first dose
Local and systematic adverse events/reactions occurred within 7 days after each vaccination, Adverse reactions associated with vaccine will be observed in subjects after vaccination. To evaluate number of adverse events/reactions compared with non-simultane vaccination group., During the 7-day period following each vaccination|Adverse events/reactions occurred within 30 days after each vaccination, To evaluate number of adverse events/reactions compared with non-simultane vaccination group., Within 30 days after any vaccination|Serious adverse events occurred throughout the study, Safety analysis. To evaluate number of SAEs compared with the non-simultane vaccination group, Up to 7 months
Cecolin is the first Chinese domestic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Cecolin is designed to protect against HPV types 16 and 18, the most common virus types that lead to cervical cancer. Hecolin is the first prophylactic vaccine against hepatitis E virus (HEV). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of co-immunization with Cecolin and Hecolin.
