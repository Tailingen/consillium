PERTH 2: Co-design of a Home-based Monitoring Service for Cancer Patients to Optimize Delivery of Systemic Therapy.
Iterative co-design study where patients receiving systemic cancer therapy, carers and healthcare professionals involved in delivering cancer therapy, work with Entia to design a home based blood monitoring service. The iterative process means that at each stage of the development process, Entia will be building on what is learnt in the previous stage.
Cancer
DEVICE: Blood measurement and monitoring|BEHAVIORAL: Interviews
Qualitative capture of user feedback- focus groups, Participant feedback on the iterative designs of a future home-based monitoring service in order to arrive at a final prototype device and service design, suitable for patient, carer and healthcare professional's use., 30 months
The study will use feedback provided by patients, carers and heatlhcare professionals to inform the changes that are necessary to develop a successful, user friendly home-based blood monitoring service for cancer patients.
