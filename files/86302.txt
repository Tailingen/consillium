Exercise Testing for Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation Treatment
Many patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer experience fatigue although doctors do not fully understand why. The purpose of this study is to test if patients who experience fatigue during radiation treatment for breast cancer have changes in their capability to perform exercise on a treadmill.

BEHAVIORAL: FACIT-Fatigue 52-point questionnaire
fatigue measurement using the 13-item FACIT-fatigue scale, Fatigue will be assessed using the 13-item FACIT-fatigue scale for the assessment of fatigue in cancer patients.24 The FACIT-Fatigue is a validated questionnaire that was originally developed for the precise evaluation of fatigue levels in cancer patients with anemia. It consists of 13 questions using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much). It has been used frequently in the clinical trial setting (please see appendix 1). Responses to each question are added with equal weight to obtain a total score. The range of possible scores is 0-52, with 0 corresponding to the highest level of fatigue and 52 corresponding to the lowest level of fatigue., 1 year
