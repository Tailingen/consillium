Evaluation of Initial High Risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) Viral Load as Predictive Marker for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 1 (CIN1) Persistence
Relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer is well established. Among the HPV types identified to date, 15 are classified as high risk HPV (HR-HPV). Detection of HR-HPV has been proposed to optimize cervical cancer screening.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
PROCEDURE: A cervico-vaginal cervical smear
The detection and the quantification of the DNA of the human oncog√®nes papillomavirus of type 16 and 18, 48 months
The detection of the markers of the integration of the genome of the human oncogenes papillomavirus (targeted at the gene E2), 48 months
A prospective detection and quantification of HR-HPV in patients with proven CIN1 will be performed. Relationship between HR-HPV initial viral load and the CIN1 persistence will be evaluated.
