Sitagliptin Improved Beta Cell Function and Prevented a Conversion Rate to Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Type 2 Diabetes in Metformin Intolerant Obese Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Metformin is the first-line therapy for PCOS with high metabolic risk, yet a large proportion of patients cannot tolerate it due to associated gastrointestinal adverse events. The alternative pharmacological strategy when metformin cannot be tolerated is not well established in this population. Our aim was to evaluate whether sitagliptin (SITA) preserves metabolic profile in metformin (MET) intolerant PCOS with high metabolic risk.
PCOS
DRUG: Sitagliptin|BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle intervention
The main outcome was change in HOMA-β index (Homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function index)., Homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function index (HOMA-β) was calculated at the base point and after 12 weeks of clinical trial.
The secondary outcome was change in fasting plasma glucose level (G0), Patient's fasting glucose level was measured at the base point and after 12 weeks of clinical trial.|The secondary outcome was change in plasma glucose level at 120 minutes (G120) after glucose load in oral glucose tolerant test (OGTT)., Patient's plasma glucose level at 120 minutes (G120) after glucose load in oral glucose tolerant test (OGTT) was measured at the base point and after 12 weeks of clinical trial.
