CT-validation of Ultrasound Based Planning for High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate Brachytherapy Using Vitesse
High Dose Rate (HDR) temporary prostate brachytherapy offers a precise form of dose escalation for prostate cancer. Needles are placed, the position is confirmed and treatment is delivered. Previously High Dose Rate prostate brachytherapy was performed under TransRectal UltraSound (TRUS) guidance but planned with Computed Tomography (CT) imaging which introduced a source of error through needle displacement while transporting and repositioning patient. Recently Varian has introduced a one-step procedure where both implant and planning are based on UltraSound imaging and performed without patient repositioning. This planning system is approved by Health Canada and is commercially available.

This study will use High Dose Rate brachytherapy to treat 20 men. Treatment will be planned with TransRectal UltraSound and validated using Computed Tomography imaging.

Accuracy of Needle Tip Identification on TransRectal UltraSound Compared to Computed Tomography, Precise location of the tip of each needle in 3-dimensional space relative to the prostate determines the pattern of dose delivery. Inaccuracies in needle tip location may lead to differences detected between UltraSound(US)-based and Computed Tomography (CT)-based plans.The distance of the needle tip (as identified on either CT images or US images) protruding beyond the template was measured in mm. The template acted as a fixed reference point as it was locked into the stabilizer/stepper apparatus. The 2 protrusion readings for each needle tip were compared, the difference recorded in mm, and categorized as \< 1 mm, 1-2 mm, 2-3 mm and \> 3 mm., Treatment was planned and delivered based on ultrasound identification of needles and needle tips relative to prostate. All measurements and comparisons of measurements pertain to the day of the procedure.
Twenty men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, suitable for the combination of external beam radiotherapy and High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be entered in this study. High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be performed using TransRectal UltraSound guidance and then planned using both cone-beam Computed Tomography and TransRectal UltraSound. Planning by Computed Tomography is to check the reliability and reproducibility of UltraSound imaging to correctly identify the needle positions. Correct needle localization is essential because this is the basis for determining source dwell positions, dose calculation and dose optimization.
