A Study Comparing of Two Different Chemotherapy Regimens, in Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm Phase 2 study comparing pemetrexed plus best supportive care with best supportive care alone as maintenance therapy following first-line treatment with a pemetrexed-cisplatin combination in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

A total of approximately 100 patients are planned to be enrolled, and following completion of four cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin (Induction Phase) those patients in which disease progression has not occurred will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms (Maintenance Phase): Arm A (pemetrexed plus best supportive care) or Arm B (best supportive care alone).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: Best Supportive Care
Progression Free Survival During Maintenance Phase, Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization until the date of progression of disease (PD) or death from any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. PD in maintenance phase uses the last lesion assessment prior to randomization as the baseline assessment., Randomization to progression of disease (PD) or date of death from any cause up to 30.9 months
Progression Free Survival During Overall Period (Induction Phase [IP] + Maintenance Phase [MP]), Progression-free survival in overall period is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug during IP until the date of PD or death from any cause. PD was determined using RECIST criteria. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. PD in overall period uses the screening lesion assessment prior to the induction phase as the baseline assessment., First dose of study drug during IP to PD or date of death from any cause up to 33.6 months|Overall Survival During Maintenance Phase, Overall survival in maintenance phase is defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants who were alive were censored at the last contact., Randomization to PD or date of death from any cause up to 31.3 months|Overall Survival During Overall Period (IP + MP), Overall survival in overall period is defined as the time from first dose of study drug during IP to death. Participants who were alive were censored at the last contact., First dose of study drug during IP to PD or date of death from any cause up to 34.1 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) During Overall Period, The list of serious adverse events (SAEs) and other non-serious adverse events (AEs) are in Adverse Events Section., First dose of study drug during IP through overall study completion (up to 34.3) months|Tumor Response Rate and Disease Control Rate After Induction Phase (IP), Tumor response rate (%) is the number of responders (participants with best response of CR or PR) divided by the number of participants qualified for tumor response according to RECIST criteria multiplied by 100. Disease control rate is percentage of participants with a best response of stable disease \[SD\], PR, or CR. CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD is≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD= neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Randomization to measured PD up to 31.4 months
