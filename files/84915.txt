Observational Trial on the Impact of Hypnose Used as a Sedation in Oncology Surgery in Breast Cancer
The investigators will compare the operated patients for a beginning breast cancer in the Hypnose arm and the patient in the classical general anesthesia arm. It is a Observational study as we cannot randomized patient, (they need to be compliant with Hypnose).

Patient will be informed that some parameters, about his recovery, will be collected from their medical file. They will not have another particular treatment because they are in the study. It is just a prospective data collection.

The patient will be compared on several items after the surgery ( as pain and pain killer intake, the heal process of the scar, etc...) Also the investigators will compare the impact of hypnose on the other treatments the patient received.

The investigators need approximately 150 patients (Half in each arm).
Early Stage Breast Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: hypnose sedation|PROCEDURE: general anesthesia
How is the recovering of the patient according his pain and anxiety, one day after the surgery? Is he anxious; does algique, both or none of the two? Each patient will be categorized according the score they obtain in the different scales., We'll collect the following information in the standard medical file :

The collected measures who will analyzed are anxiety, pain and consumption of analgesic.

Items :

1. Anxiety (will be mesured by the anxiety visual scale)
2. Pain (mesured by analogic visual pain scale)
3. consumption of analgesic (Yes / No - in case o YES : Type, duration, quantity per day) All the responses to the item will be reported and a conclusion between the part of anxiety and the part of the pain will be combine (ex : patient is anxious and have no pain, patient have pain and anxiety, patient have pain and no anxiety, patient have no pain and no anxiety)., One day after the surgery
How is the recovering of the patient according his pain and anxiety, seven days after the surgery? Is he anxious; does algique, both or none of the two?

* Redness of the skin : yes /no
* Delay in the scar process : yes/ no
* Infection: yes/ no
* Hypertrophie of the scar : yes/no
* Pain : Yes/No After analysis of the parameters, we will determine a good scar healing process, or not., 7 days post surgery
