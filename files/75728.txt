Tumor Landscape Pathological Diagnosis by Large Tissue Sections
The aim of this study is to establish large tissue sections for 10 kinds of tumors. in order to observe the tumor landscape on microscope. The tumors including esophageal carcinoma,gastric carcinoma,hepatocellular carcinoma etc.200 cases of each tumor will be compared by traditional sample method and landscape sample method to testify the clinical value and significance of tumor landscape pathological diagnosis .
