Clinical Outcomes and Biomarkers in Patients With Stage 0-IV Melanoma in Real Clinical Practice
Prospective non-interventional study of clinical outcomes and biomarkers in patients with stage 0-IV skin melanoma in real clinical practice
Melanoma|Melanoma (Skin)|Melanoma, Uveal|Melanoma Stage IV|Melanoma Stage III|Melanoma, Stage II|Melanoma in Situ|Melanoma, Ocular
DRUG: surgery (any volume) and / or pharmaceuticals treatment initiated or planned or only dynamic observation, in accordance with current clinical guidelines
12-month relapse-free survival, The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is 12-month relapse-free survival, defined as the time from index date to the date of first documented relapse or death from any cause (for stage 0-III asymptomatic patients with or without adjuvant therapy, cohorts B and C)., 12 months|12-month progression free survival, The second primary efficacy endpoint is the 12-month PFS, defined as the time from the index date to the date of the first documented investigator-determined progression or death from any cause. If the patient has not experienced an event, PFS will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment (for patients with IIIC/D unresectable or metastatic melanoma, cohorts A, A1, D)., 12 months
Most oncology experts now recognize that the most effective and safest treatment options should be considered for first-line therapy. Since the planned use of drugs, including dosing, treatment interruption and early discontinuation of treatment, in clinical practice may differ from the procedures used in clinical trials, post-marketing "real world" data are important to quantify the feasibility, acceptability, and practical considerations for prescribing targeted and immunotherapy. Therefore, for the clinical and scientific communities, it is of great interest to evaluate the choice of the patient and the method of treatment used in the daily practice of oncological centers in Russia. Moreover, the available data imply an association between PDl-1 expression and other biomarkers in tumors and the efficacy of drug therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with stage 0-IV skin melanoma in real clinical practice in the context of different levels of PDl-1 expression in the tumor and other potential biomarkers. In addition, it is of interest to gain insight into the real-world data on the quality of life of melanoma patients treated for metastatic disease. It is well known, that the prognosis of patients with stage 0-IV melanoma is too heterogeneous, therefore, in this study, distinguish several cohorts will be organised.
