EGFR Monoclonal Antibody for Advanced Gastric Cancer
This study is intended to evaluate efficacy and safety of EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab/Nimotuzumab) in combination with a chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients with EGFR amplification.
Gastric Cancer|Cetuximab|Nimotuzumab
DRUG: EGFR antibody and Chemotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from treatment beginning until disease progression, Evaluation of tumor burden until first documented progress through study completion, an average of 2 years|Objective Response Rate, Proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of a predefined amount, including complete remission and partial remission., Evaluation of tumor burden through study completion, an average of 2 years
Overall Survival, Time from treatment beginning until death from any cause, From date of treatment beginning until the date of death from any cause through study completion, an average of 2 years|Adverse Effect, Incidence of Treatment-related adverse Events, Incidence of Treatment-related adverse Events through study completion, an average of 2 years
This parallel, randomized, open-label, single-centre study will evaluate the effect on overall survival of EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab/Nimotuzumab) in combination with a chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR-amplication advanced gastric cancer. Cetuximab will be administered as intravenous infusion of 500 mg/m2 (BSA) every 3 weeks, while nimotuzumab will be administered as intravenous infusion of 400mg every week. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 12 cycles of mFOLFOX-6, 6-8 cycles of SOX, 6-8 cycles of CapOX. Treatment with cetuximab/nimotuzumab will continue until disease progression. The target sample size is 50-100 patients.
