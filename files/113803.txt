A Phase I/II Study of CAR.70-Engineered IL15-Transduced Cord Blood-Derived NK Cells With TGF-beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) Knock Out in Conjunction With Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy for the Management of Relapsed/Refractory Myeloid Malignancies
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the recommended safe dose of TGFBR2 KO CAR27/IL-15 NK cells that can be given to patients with relapsed/refractory disease. The safety and effectiveness of this treatment will also be studied.
Myeloid Malignancies
DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* Phase I: To determine the safety and optimal cell dose of TGFBR2 KO CAR27/IL-15 NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloid malignances
* Phase II: To determine the response rates of TGFBR2 KO CAR27/IL-15 NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and in patients with MDS or CMML after HMA failure

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the CR rate in each cohort
* To determine the rate of flow cytometry MRD negativity (AML cohort only)
* To assess duration of response, relapse-free survival (AML cohort only), and overall survival
* To determine hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities

Exploratory Objectives:

* To assess impact of baseline cytomolecular features and CD70 expression on response
* To quantify persistence of the infused CAR product
* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies
