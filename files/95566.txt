Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinomas in Gorlin Syndrome
The overall aim of the project is to gain knowledge about the expected course of nevoid basal cell carcinomas and the usefulness of dermatoscopy in young individuals with Gorlin syndrome.

Clinical experience and some case-reports suggest that nevoid basal cell carcinomas have an indolent course with slow growth and that they can sometimes regress. However, no systematic research has previously been performed.

Increased knowledge about nevoid basal cell carcinomas and the use of dermatoscopy could be of great clinical value in the follow-up and treatment of individuals with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.
