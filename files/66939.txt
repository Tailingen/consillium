A Study Evaluating Maintenance Therapy After First Line Chemotherapy in Metastatic Cancer Pancreas
A randomized phase II study evaluating maintenance therapy after first line induction chemotherapy in metastatic cancer pancreas.
Cancer of Pancreas
DRUG: Capecitabine|OTHER: follow up
PFS, that will be calculated from the time of randomization till disease progression or death, 6 months
OS, that will be calculated from the time of starting of the disease to death (all causes), 1 year
In this study, we aim to evaluate the role of maintenance capecitabine by comparing 2 arms of metastatic cancer pancreas patients in the first line , the first arm will receive 4 months of induction FOLFRINOX the maintenance capecitabine and the second arm will receive 4 months of FOLFRINOX then kept under follow-up:

•Primary end point: PFS.

•Secondary end points: OS, QOL and Toxicity.
