Comparative Evaluation of Results of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Versus Ponatinib in CML Patients Carrying a Mutation T315I
Effective treatment options for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with the T315I mutation are few. This study compared overall survival (OS) between CML and Ph+ ALL patients treated with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).
Leukemia
DRUG: Ponatinib (IclusigÂ®)|PROCEDURE: allogeneic stem cell transplantation
Overall survival after either allogeneic stem cell transplantation or Ponatinib initiation. (Time between therapeutic intervention and death, in months), From date of inclusion until the date of death, assessed up to 180 months
