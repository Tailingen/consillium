The incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03, Throughout the study (approximately 18 months).|Change from baseline in physical examination findings, A complete physical examination will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle and at the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit. The examination will include an assessment of general appearance; abdomen, skin, head and neck; lymph nodes, and thyroid; and respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological systems., Throughout the study (approximately 18 months).|Change from baseline in clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation parameters, Blood samples for monitoring of clinical chemistry parameters and determination of haematology will be taken at screening, Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle thereafter, and at the end-of-treatment visit., Throughout the study (approximately 18 months).|Change from baseline in vital signs, Resting heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, temperature, and weight at the screening visit. Height will be measured at the screening visit only. Vital signs and weight should be obtained Day 1 of each treatment cycle and at the EOT visit., Throughout the study (approximately 18 months).|Determine the presence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to MEDI4736 (durvalumab)., The presence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to MEDI4736 (durvalumab) will be determined as a measure of the immunogenicity of MEDI4736 in combination with AZD1775 (adavosertib)., Throughout the study (approximately 18 months).|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD1775 (adavosertib) when combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with advanced solid tumours will be determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1.

The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of the patients with a confirmed best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set., Estimated 18 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD1775 (adavosertib) when combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with advanced solid tumours will be determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1.

Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of first dose of MEDI4736 until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment., Estimated 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD1775 (adavosertib) when combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with advanced solid tumours will be determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1.

The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients in the efficacy analysis set with a confirmed best overall response of CR or PR, or a best overall response of Stable Disease (SD)., Estimated 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), The preliminary anti-tumour activity of AZD1775 (adavosertib) when combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in patients with advanced solid tumours will be determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1.

Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until death due to any cause. Any subject known to be alive at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. Equivalent to PFS, patients will be followed for survival until the last patient has discontinued study drug., Estimated 18 months|QTc interval, To characterise the effect of AZD1775 (adavosertib) on QTc in patients with advanced solid tumours when combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) triplicate ECGs will be obtained at screening and approximately 2-5 minutes apart at the time of PK sample collection as follows: Day -5 pre-dose AZD1775 (adavosertib), Cycle 1 Day 17 pre-dose AZD1775 (adavosertib) and 4 hours post-dose. The ECG assessments will be performed before the PK sample is collected., Up to 28 days|Levels of immunologically relevant leukocyte subpopulations, Levels of immunologically relevant leukocyte subpopulations will be measured by analysis of a panel of cytokines and chemokines involved in Th1-driven immune responses and changes in proliferating T cells., Up to 28 days|Plasma concentrations of AZD1775 (adavosertib) and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) when given in combination, and of AZD1775 (adavosertib) when given alone., up to 28 days
This is a Phase I, multi-center, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral therapy with AZD1775 (adavosertib) when combined with a fixed-dose of MEDI4736 (durvalumab). Immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumour activity in patients with refractory solid tumours will also be investigated. In the initial design of this study a novel combination of AZD1775 (adavosertib) and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) was tested. The starting dose of AZD1775 (adavosertib) was 125 mg BID, over 5 days with 9 days off in 14-day cycles. This was designated Schedule A. This dose was not well tolerated. Two of six patients experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The protocol was amended to include three additional dosing schedules. designated Schedules B, C, and D. In Schedule B patients will receive MEDI4736 (durvalumab) on Day 1, AZD1775 (adavosertib) on Days 15-17 and Days 22-24 of a 28-day cycle. In Schedule C, patients will receive MEDI4736 (durvalumab) on Day 1, AZD1775 (adavosertib) on Days 8-10, Days 15-17 and Days 22-24 of 28-day cycles. In Schedule D, patients will receive MEDI4736 (durvalumab) on Day 1 and AZD1775 (adavosertib) on Days 15-19 and Days 22-26 of a 28-day cycle. AZD1775 (adavosertib) will be dosed on a maximum of 6 days (Schedule B), 9 days (Schedule C), or 10 days (Schedule D) in each 28-day cycle. In all schedules, dexamethasone will be administered as an anti-emetic on the first day of each of the AZD1775 (adavosertib) consecutive dosing day blocks including the lead-in portion for Schedules B, C, and D. AZD1775 (adavosertib) will be administered at least 1 week after MEDI4736 (durvalumab) administration. Three to six patients will be enrolled in dose level 1 of Schedule B and evaluated for safety over a 28-day cycle prior to opening Schedule C dose level 1 for enrolment. Following safety evaluation of three to six patients in Schedule C dose level 1, a decision will be made by the Safety Review Team (SRT) to move forward with one or both schedules for further dose escalation. Three to six patients will be enrolled in Schedule D dose level 1 and evaluated for safety over a 28-day cycle. Patients in Schedule D will be evaluated for escalation independently of those in Schedules A, B, and C. Dose escalation will continue until identification of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined this cohort will be expanded to a total of 18 patients to collect further safety data and for preliminary assessment of efficacy. Alternative dose levels/cohorts and/or schedules may be explored if emerging data suggest these would be more appropriate. The first day of Cycle 1 in Schedules B, C, and D will be preceded by a lead-in period of AZD1775 (adavosertib) monotherapy to enable serial sampling for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.
