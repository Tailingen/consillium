Study of Docetaxel in Breast Cancer Patients
Primary objectives:

* To compare the disease free survival (DFS) in patients treated with the sequential epidoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) regimen to that in patients treated with the same treatment plus docetaxel given sequentially after epidoxorubicin

Secondary objectives:

* To compare the DFS in patients treated with the sequential epidoxorubicin, docetaxel and CMF (only patients with \> or = 4 lymph nodes) regimen to that in patients treated with sequential intensified epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/high dose (HD) cyclophosphamide regimen
* To evaluate the overall survival in each arm
* To evaluate the tolerability of a sequential intensified epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/HD-cyclophosphamide (arm C)
* To compare the safety of a sequential epidoxorubicin/docetaxel/CMF (arm B) regimen versus a standard sequential epidoxorubicin/CMF regimen (arm A)
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: epidoxorubicine, ciclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracile|DRUG: epidoxorubicine, docetaxel, ciclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracile|DRUG: epidoxorubicine, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide
Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) - with exclusion of ductal carcinoma in situ- DCIS- either collateral or ipsilateral, according to STEEP in adjuvant breast cancer trial: Standardized Definitions for Efficacy Endpoints, Time between randomization date and date of local or distant recurrence or contralateral breast cancer or second primary (non breast) cancer or death from any cause, whichever occurs first
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Time between the date of randomization and the date of local or distant recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, thus excluding contralateral breast cancer or second primary (non breast) cancers|Overall Survival (OS), Time between the date of randomization and date of death|Distant Disease-Free Survival (DDFS), Time betwen the date of randomization and the date of distant recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first
