Prospective Comparison of Immunological Benefit of Laparoscopic Colectomy
This study aimed to clarify existence of immunological benefit of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery compared to open colon surgery.
Immunity
Immune factors, post OP 5th day
Post-operative complications, POD 7th days
Patients with clinical stage â…¢ left colon and upper rectal cancer were prospectively assigned to undergo LC (n=35) or OC (n=39). Factors related to cellular immunity of host (total lymphocyte count, CD4 lymphocyte, CD8 lymphocyte, CD4/CD8 ratio, HLA-DR expression on monocyte (mHLA-DR)) were examined preoperatively, on the 1st day of operation (POD1) and the 5th day of operation (POD5).
