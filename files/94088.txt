A Phase 1/1b Study of MEDI3726 in Adults Subjects With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD \[in the absence of establishing the MTD\]) for single agent MEDI3726 in subjects with mCRPC who have received prior treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, with or without a prior taxane-based chemotherapy in the mCRPC setting.
