Impact of Y90 Radiation Segmentectomy on HCC
The aim of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of radiation segmentectomy with Theraspheres in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma that would qualify for thermal ablation as per the BCLC guidelines, but are unable to receive thermal ablation due to unfavorable location of target lesions.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiation Segmentectomy
Number of Participants With Local Tumor Response According to mRECIST, Efficacy of 90Yttrium (Y90) Radiation Segmentectomy on Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma as measured by tumor response according to mRECIST.

CR = Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions PR = At least a 30% decrease in the diameter of the viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesion SD = Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease PD = An increase of at least 20% in the diameter of viable (enhancing) target lesion, 2 years
Median Time to Progression (TTP), Time until progression of the target lesion and overall disease based on mRECIST, 2 years|Cumulative Incidence of Participants With Local Progression, Cumulative incidence function estimation of the incidence of the occurrence of local progression (event) at 1 year and 2 years while taking the competing risk of transplant into account.

Local progression was defined per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (mRECIST) for target lesions and assessed by MRI with local progression defined as an \>20% increase in the diameter of the viable (enhancing) target lesion, taking as a reference of the baseline enhancing tumor size., 1 year and 2 years|Quantifying Dose to Target Lesion, The dose was calculated using PET/CT calculated dose estimation delivered to the tumor. Counts on PET/CT post-treatment were used to estimate the dose delivered to the tumor., 0 days|Number of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Number of treatment related adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 5.0 (CTCAE)., For 2 years with visits 6 weeks post treatment then every 3 months since treatment for 24 months for assessment of laboratory and clinical symptoms|Number of Participants With Access Site-related Adverse Events, Number of participants with access site-related adverse events, For 2 years with visits 6 weeks post treatment then every 3 months since treatment for 24 months for assessment of laboratory and clinical symptoms|Number of Participants With Treatment-related Laboratory Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-related laboratory adverse events assessed 6 weeks post-treatment then every 3 months since treatment for 24 months, For 2 years with visits 6 weeks post treatment then every 3 months since treatment for 24 months for assessment of laboratory changes
