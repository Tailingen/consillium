Study of Vudalimab or Pembrolizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended dose of vudalimab to be used in combination with chemotherapy (Part 1) and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vudalimab plus standard of care chemotherapy relative to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (Part 2) as first-line treatment in patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Vudalimab + Carboplatin + Pemetrexed|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Pembrolizumab + Carboplatin + Pemetrexed
Part 1: Recommended Phase 2 dose of vudalimab in combination with chemotherapy, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment, Day 1 to Day 21|Part 2: Progression free survival, Progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 or death, whichever comes first, Day 1 to 2.5 years
Antitumor activity, Objective response rate as determined by investigator, duration of response (Part 1 and Part 2), Day 1 to 1.4 years|Changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), Examine ctDNA changes as a surrogate marker for disease burden (Part 1 and Part 2), Day 1 to 1.4 years|Maximum Serum Drug Concentration (Cmax), (Part 1 and Part 2), Day 1 to 1.4 years|Trough Serum Drug Concentration (Ctrough), (Part 1 and Part 2), Day 1 to 1.4 years|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC), (Part 1 and Part 2), Day 1 to 1.4 years|Overall survival, Time to death from any cause (Part 2), Day 1 to 2.5 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Time Frame: Day 1 to 1.4 years]
This is a Phase 1b/2 study, multicenter, open-label, randomized study in patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer without prior treatment for metastatic disease. Part 1 is designed to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of vudalimab, an anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, in combination with standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety vudalimab, at the RP2D, plus SOC relative to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) plus SOC chemotherapy.
