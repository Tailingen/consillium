A Study of CART-TnMUC1 in Patients With TnMUC1-Positive Advanced Cancers
Multi-center, open-label, first in human Phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the administration of genetically modified autologous T cells (CART-TnMUC1 cells) engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) capable of recognizing the tumor antigen, TnMUC1 and activating the T cell (CART- TnMUC1 cells).

The Dose Escalation phase of the study is designed to identify the dose and regimen of CART-TnMUC1 cells that can be safely administered intravenously following the lymphodepletion (LD) regimen to patients with (1) advanced TnMUC1+ solid tumors (triple negative breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer) and (2) advanced TnMUC1+ multiple myeloma in a parallel two-arm dose escalation study. The Dose Escalation phase is anticipated to enroll approximately 40 patients.

The Expansion phase of the study is designed to assess the preliminary efficacy of CART-TnMUC1 cells administered intravenously to patients with TnMUC1+ solid tumors. The Expansion phase is anticipated to enroll approximately 72 patients (18 patients per each tumor indication).
