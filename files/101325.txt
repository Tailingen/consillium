A Study of ZL-1211 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This study is a Phase I/II, open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of ZL-1211 administered by IV infusion on a every 2 weeks (Q2W) schedule.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ZL-1211
Phase I ï¼šMTD or MAD, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) (if no MTD is defined) of ZL-1211, One month|Phase I and Phase II: safety and tolerability, Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Approximately 10 months|Phase II: preliminary antitumor activity, Objective response rate defined as the proportion of patients with partial response (PR) proportion of patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on Investigator assessment of tumor lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 10 months
Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):AUC, Area under the curve (AUC), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):Tmax, Time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):Ctrough, Ctrough, Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):Vss, Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):CL, Clearance (CL), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: pharmacokinetics (PK):t1/2, Half-life (t1/2), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Approximately 10 months|Phase I and Phase II: immunogenicity, Quantity of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Approximately 10 months|Phase II: preliminary antitumor activity, Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from the first date of objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Approximately 10 months
The study consists of two stages, Phase I -Dose Escalation Phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) (if no MTD is defined) of ZL-1211, and Phase II -Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor activity of ZL-1211 with the dose established in the Dose Escalation Phase. The trial was intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial but the Phase 2 was not initiated.
