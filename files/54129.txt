A Study of Sotorasib in People With Brain Tumors
The researchers are doing this study to find out how effective sotorasib is at getting into KRAS G12C+ brain tumors. The researchers will also find out whether sotorasib is a safe and effective treatment for people undergoing surgical resection of KRAS G12C+ metastatic brain tumors, and do tests that show how the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of sotorasib.
