Lenvatinib Plus DEB-TACE With/Without FOLFOX-HAIC for Large HCC With PVTT
This multicenter retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with large HCC and PVTT who received lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE with/without FOLFOX-HAIC between July 2019 and June 2021. Tumor response, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were compared between the two groups.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC|PROCEDURE: Len+DEB-TACE
Time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression., 3.5 years
objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete or partial response, 3.5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete or partial response, or stable disease, 3.5 years|overall survival, defined as the time from treatment initiation until death from any reason., 3.5 years|treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), assessed based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, 3.5 years
Consecutive patients with large HCC and PVTT treated with lenvatinib plus drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin (Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC) or lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE (Len+DEB-TACE) from July 2019 to June 2021 were screened. Tumor response was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Clinical outcomes, including tumor response, TTP, OS, and TRAEs were compared between the two groups.
