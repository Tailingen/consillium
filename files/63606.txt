A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of HB0036 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
It is a Phase I/II, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of HB0036 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor|NSCLC
DRUG: HB0036
Safety and tolerability, Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) \[ Time Frame: During the first 21 days \]DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected or definite relationship to study drug., Up to 12 Months|MTD, MTD or OBD and/or RP2D., Up to 24 Months
AUC, Area Under concentration-time Curve (AUC), Up to 24 Months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), Up to 24 Months|Tmax, half-life time of maximum concentration, Up to 24 Months
ORR assessment in dose-escalation phase, Overall response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 Months
This is a phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study in patients with advanced solid tumors. During the phase Ⅰ study, the safety and tolerability of HB0036 will be evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the phase Ⅱ study, the safety and efficacy of HB0036 at the RP2D will be evaluated in cohorts of patients with NSCLC and/or other solid tumors.

A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will be established throughout the study period, consisting of the principal investigator, representatives of the contract research organization (CRO) (medical inspectors and other relevant personnel), and the Sponsor's medical monitor. The SRC will evaluate safety data based on the study process. The SRC may recommend extended doses, possible changes in the frequency of administration, and extended tumor types for safety reasons based on existing studies prior to starting the phase II study.
