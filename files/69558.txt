Application of Genomic Techniques and Image Processing Using Artificial Intelligence to Obtain a Predictor Model Risk of Melanoma
The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model of risk of developing melanoma. The investigators will used artificial intelligence techniques to analysed images patterns obtained by clinical and dermoscopic pictures. The investigators want to defined a new predictive risk model obtained from genetic information and image analysis of pigmented lesions. This model could help to discriminate more accurately those patients who are most likely to develop melanoma in a high-risk population.
