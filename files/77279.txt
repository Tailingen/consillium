Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Avelumab Immunotherapy for Treatment of Malignant Mesothelioma
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of avelumab and SBRT is safe and what effect avelumab has on mesothelioma when given in combination with SBRT. In addition, a goal of this protocol is to study the effect of radiation therapy on the immune system. It is thought that radiation treatment may create a form of 'vaccine' against cancer inside the body and immunotherapy may improve this effect. The combination of radiation treatment and immunotherapy may be more effective against cancer than either radiation or immunotherapy alone.
