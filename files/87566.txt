SKB264 Combinatiton Therapy in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of SKB264 in combination with KL-A167 with or without chemotherapy with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The study is divided into two parts. Part 1 will be the safety run-in phase, and Part 2 will be the cohort expansion phase.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SKB264|DRUG: KL-A167|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, From baseline up to 30 days after last dose or to the beginning of the new anti-cancer therapy, up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), assessed by Investigator based on RECIST version 1.1., From baseline to first documented objective response, up to 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from baseline to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From baseline to the first documented disease progression or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) was defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. DoR was measured for responding subjects (PR or CR) only., From the date of first objective response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of PD or death (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the sum of complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate, and stable disease (SD) rate. As per RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From baseline to date of first documented objective response (CR, PR, and SD), up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of SKB264-ADC, SKB264-TAB and free KL610023, Cycle 1-8, every 4 cycles starting from Cycle 12 Day 1: pre-dose, post-dose (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of SKB264-ADC, SKB264-TAB and free KL610023, Cycle 1-8, every 4 cycles starting from Cycle 12 Day 1: pre-dose, post-dose (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of KL-A167, Cycle 1-8, every 4 cycles starting from Cycle 12 Day 1: pre-dose, post-dose (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of KL-A167, Cycle 1-8, every 4 cycles starting from Cycle 12 Day 1: pre-dose, post-dose (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months|Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) for SKB264 and KL-A167, Cycle 1-8, every 4 cycles starting from Cycle 12 Day 1: pre-dose, post-dose (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months
