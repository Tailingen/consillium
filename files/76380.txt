Clinical and Histological Features of Head and Neck Melanoma
The worldwide incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been increasing for the last 30 years in western populations. Among all melanomas, those located on the head and neck are more frequent than expected regarding the surface of this anatomical area, occur in older subjects than melanomas at other sites and have a worse prognosis than melanomas at other sites. The question whether head and neck melanomas could be a distinct entity has been debated.
