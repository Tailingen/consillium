Novel Anti-CD19 Universal CAR-T Cells for r/r CD19+ B-ALL
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-labeled clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCAR-T Cells injection for patients with relapsed/refractory(r/r) B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(B-ALL).
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B-ALL
BIOLOGICAL: UCAR-T Cells
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Neurotoxicity and/or CRS≥G3., Up to 28 days after infusion|Incidence of Treatment Related adverse events (AEs), The frequency, severity, and laboratory findings of all adverse events/serious adverse events are included., Up to 12 months after infusion
Persistence of CAR-T cells, The persistence over time of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry and qPCR., Up to 24 weeks after infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), Patients who achieve CR(complete response) or CRi after infusion, At 4,8,12 weeks after infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time between the time a patient with tumor disease receives treatment and the time between the observation of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 24 weeks after infusion|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 24 weeks after infusion|Duration of remission (DOR), Duration of remission (DOR) is the time from the first detection of CR or PR to the discovery of PD., Up to 24 weeks after infusion
Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant clinical outcome in patients with r/r B-ALL，autologous CAR-T is not feasible for some patients. To make further improvement, the investigators are going to conduct a clinical trial using universal CAR-T(UCAR-T) cells targeting CD19 for r/r B-ALL patients.

After enrollment, patients will get a 3-5 days lymphodepletion therapy, then the UCAR-T Cells will be infused by vein. Subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy up to 12 weeks. For those with a durable remission 12 weeks after infusion, the follow-up will last for at least 12 months for disease control.
