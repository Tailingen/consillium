EUCROSS: European Trial on Crizotinib in ROS1 Translocated Lung Cancer
EUCROSS is a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 translocations. Patients will be treated with 250mg crizotinib bid until progression or intolerable toxicity.
Lung Cancer|Adenocarcinoma|NSCLC
DRUG: Crizotinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR); evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, CT/MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib treatment in advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 fusion genes (primary outcome measure: objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v.1.1), From time of beginning of treatment until the documention of response according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 12 months) .
Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1; evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, CT/MRI scans will be performed to assess the PFS during treatment period., From time of beginning of treatment until the first documented event of progression according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 12 months).|Overall Survival (OS); evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, OS will be assessed by telephone calls every 3 months after the safety follow-up visit., From beginning to end of study (Last subject last visit (LSLV)) (up to approximately 24 months).|Duration of Response (DR); evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, CT/MRI scans will be performed to asses the DR., From time of beginning of treatment until the documention of progression according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 12 months).|Time to Tumor Response; evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, CT/MRI scans will be performed to assess the Time to Tumor Response., From time of beginning of treatment until the first documented event of response according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 3 months).|Disease Control Rate (DCR); evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v.1.1 analysis, CT/MRI scans will be performed at weeks 6, 12, 24 to assess the DCR., From beginning of treatment to week 6, 12 and 24 according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 3 months).|Safety/Adverse Events and tolerability in all patients treated with crizotinib assessed by number and severity of adverse events as recorded on the case report form, vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram and RECIST1.1, Safety and tolerability will be assessed on every study visit and for 28 days after end of treatment., From beginning of treatment until 28 days post treatment (expected average 12 months).|Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13), Patient reported outcomes (PRO) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease/treatment related symptoms of lung cancer and general health status, Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-LC13, EORTC QLQ-C30) completed at baseline and every 4 weeks from beginning of treatment until end of study.|To evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib treatment in the patient subgroup with ROS1 translocation confirmed by the CAGE technology regarding the objective response rate (ORR) (evaluation criteria: investigator assessed RECIST v1.1), CT/MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib treatment in advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 fusion genes as confirmed by CAGE sequencing, From time of beginning of treatment until the documention of response according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 12 months) .|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DR), Time to Tumor Response, Disease Control Rate (DCR); evaluation criteria: RECIST v1.1 by independent radiologic review, CT/MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib treatment, From time of beginning of treatment until the documention of response according to RECIST v1.1 (expected average 12 months) .
Characterization of ROS1 fusion gene on a genomic level by CAGE Technology to identify the exact break-apart point as well as the involved fusion genes., CAGE technology (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) is an RNA based sequencing technology to identify the exact break-apart point as well as the fusion genes., From beginning of screening of first patient to screening of last patient (expected average 24 months).|Characterization of molecular and genetic mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib treatment in patients showing disease progression., Mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib will be analysed by molecular pathologic analyses, e.g. NGS and FISH., At time of disease progression (expected average 12 months).
EUCROSS is a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 translocations. In individual treatment attempts and an ongoing phase I trial crizotinib has shown remarkable effects on this selected subgroup of lung cancer patients. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocking the catalytic activity of rearranged ALK and ROS1 as well as MET. The patients eligible for the trial will be treated with 250mg crizotinib twice-daily. Tumor response to treatment will be assessed every 6 weeks by CT or MRI scans. In case of progression treatment beyond may be conducted if clinically indicated. To identify mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib treatment, an optional re-biopsy may be performed in these cases and fresh frozen tumor material will analyzed at the University of Cologne.
