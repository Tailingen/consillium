A Study of MEK162 and Paclitaxel in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer
This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer will receive investigational study drug MEK162 and paclitaxel. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in combination with paclitaxel in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 36 patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.
