Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells Control by Signal Regulatory Protein-alpha: Investigation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
project is to study and develop anti-Signal Regulatory Protein α (SIRPα) antibodies (Ab) as a new immunotherapy strategy in cancer.

Samples harvested from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ovarian cancer patients will be used in evaluation of the SIRP-CD47 expression and of the effect of the anti-human Signal Regulatory Protein (hSIRP) Ab on various cellular types from patients and healthy volunteers.
