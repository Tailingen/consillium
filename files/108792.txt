Addition of Anlotinib Hydrochloride to the Stupp Regimen Versus the Stupp Regimen Alone for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
For patients with glioblastoma,postoperative radiotherapy combined with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp regimen) has long been considered a standard treatment approach.The treatment outcomes, however, are still dismal, with a median overall survival time of 8-12 months. As a novel small molecule multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, anlotinib hydrochloride has been found to be able to inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and cell growth.Previous studies on recurrent glioblastoma have demonstrated its effectiveness in tumor control with manageable toxicities. The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the additional anlotinib hydrochloride to the Stupp regimen for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
