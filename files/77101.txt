Identification the Expression of Sox2 in Colorectal Cancer Tissues
Sox2 has been studied in several types of human solid tumors. The investigators found that Sox2 had higher expression level in colorectal cancer and metastatic tissues than normal tissues. So the investigators assumed that whether Sox2 plays an important role in the progression and migration of colon cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
In our study, we examined Sox2 expression in archived human colon cancer tissues and found that its Sox2 expression correlates with reduced patient survival, increased tumor grade and metastasis probability.
