Fulvestrant and Ipatasertib for Advanced HER-2 Negative and Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) Breast Cancer Following Progression on First Line CDK 4/6 Inhibitor and Aromatase Inhibitor
The purpose of this study is to find out whether a new drug, Ipatasertib, can slow the growth of advanced breast cancer when added to standard therapy (Fulvestrant).

Patients enrolled in this study will receive either Ipatasertib plus Fulvestrant or placebo (a substance that looks like the study drug but does not have any active or medicinal ingredient) plus Fulvestant. The study will provide information about the ability of Ipatasertib plus Fulvestrant to control the cancer, the side effects and safety of the treatment, how patients feel while taking the treatment and associated costs.
