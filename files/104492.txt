QOL After SURGERY and ADJUVANT Treatment
The goal of this prospective, observational study is to measure and analyze the effect of adjuvant treatment over the quality of life and recovery of patients undergoing pulmonary resection because of non-small cells lung cancer using the EORTC-LC29 questionnaire. The main question it aims to answer is:

Whether adjuvant systemic treatment affect or not the postoperative QOL of a NSCLC patient that underwent lung resection

Participants will fulfill two questionnaires (EORTC-LC29 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) in different stages of their treatment.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Quality of Life
OTHER: Questionnaires
Quality of life before and after adjuvant treatment in patients undergoing pulmonary resection, For quality of life assessment, patients will be asked to complete the Quality of Life Questionnaire Module LC29 (QLQ-LC29) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)., Pre-surgery, seven days after surgery, before the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment

Patients will be asked to complete the Quality of Life Questionnaire Module LC29 (QLQ-LC29) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Post-surgery complications will be collected from the patient's medical record, recorded in the Jimena 4 software program. Hospital stay lenght will be collected from the patientÂ´s hospital discharge report., Before surgery, seven days after surgery, before the first dose of adjuvant treatment|Effect of complications from adjuvant treatment on the surgical items of the EORTC-LC29, Measure and analyze the effect of complications from adjuvant treatment on the surgical items of the EORTC-LC29 for patients undergoing lung resection for lung cancer. Patients will be asked to complete the Quality of Life Questionnaire Module LC29 (QLQ-LC29) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), where higher score represents higher level of symptomatology or problems., Before the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment|Adjuvant chemotherapy/immunotherapy treatment regimen significantly decreases the quality of life, Measure and analyze whether any adjuvant chemotherapy/immunotherapy treatment regimen significantly decreases the quality of life of patients who receive adjuvant treatment after undergoing lung resection compared to others., Before the first cycle of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment|Correlation between the presence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and postoperative quality of life, Analyze the correlation between the presence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and postoperative quality of life upon completion of the surgical episode before and after receiving any form of adjuvant treatment for lung cancer. Patients will be asked to complete the Quality of Life Questionnaire Module LC29 (QLQ-LC29) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)., Before surgery, seven days after surgery, before the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment|Level of anxiety/depression in patients undergoing lung resection before and after receiving the first cycle of adjuvant treatment, Measure and analyze the level of anxiety/depression in patients undergoing lung resection before and after receiving the first cycle of adjuvant treatment for lung cancer. Patients will be asked to complete the HADS questionnaire., Before the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment|Effect of Performance Status (PS) and pre-adjuvant treatment ECOG on the quality of life after receiving the first cycle of any treatment modality., Measure and analyze the effect of Performance Status (PS) and pre-adjuvant treatment ECOG on the quality of life after receiving the first cycle of any treatment modality. Patients will be asked to complete the Quality of Life Questionnaire Module LC29 (QLQ-LC29) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Performance Status Score and ECOG score data will be collected from the patient's medical record, recorded in the Jimena 4 software program., Before the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after the first dose of adjuvant treatment, 2 days after finishing the whole cycle of adjuvant treatment
Despite being surgery the preferred radical treatment of NSCLC in early stages, unforseen N2 disease, larger tumors or bad prognosis histological or molecular findings of the tumor will benefit of receiving adjuvant treatment.

As an adjuvant treatment, postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy has demonstrated its efficacy in increasing survival rates and reducing recurrence rates. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is limited due to decreased lung tolerance following surgery and conflicting results.

It is clear that lung cancer significantly impacts the quality of life of patients. According to the Lung Cancer Europe (LuCE) association, a survey conducted in 2021 with 515 patients revealed that 91.2% experienced limitations in their daily lives. Fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive difficulties, and significant reductions in physical activity were the main areas where patients reported the most complications. In addition to the inherent complications of cancer, we must consider the complications associated with surgery and systemic treatment.

Module LC29 is an update of the previous module published by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), providing a more current perspective on lung cancer. This latest module retains 12 out of the 13 items from LC13 and adds 17 new items, which gather information on the side effects of medical and targeted therapies, as well as emotional problems. Furthermore, it includes 5 specific questions related to lung surgery. This multidisciplinary approach currently makes the LC29 questionnaire the most comprehensive tool for studying the quality of life of lung cancer patients.
