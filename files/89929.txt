Immune response, Evaluating immune response to a second COVID-19 vaccination booster (3rd vaccine) in patients with solid tumor malignancies on immunosuppressive cancer therapies by antibody quantification in blood samples., 3 months
Adverse events, Evaluating immune response to a second COVID-19 vaccination booster (3rd vaccine) in patients with solid tumor malignancies on immunosuppressive cancer therapies by T-cell quantification in blood samples., 3 months
In recent work performed by the University of Arizona Cancer Center team, 59 patients with a known diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy on active immunosuppressive cancer therapy were enrolled through the University of Arizona Cancer Center during their routine care. These subjects had a decreased response with the vaccine when compared to the health cohort. The investigators are amending this study to explore the effects on immune response to include a potential third vaccine for the cancer cohort. This will increase the visits required to approximately two more visits. It will require two additional blood samples, one 48 hours prior to third vaccine and the second, 5-11 days after the third vaccine. The following protocol will be for the subjects that decide to continue onto a third vaccination.
