Feasibility and Safety of Functional Performance Testing in Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to see if exercise fitness testing is feasible and safe in persons over 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with a hematological malignancy and are scheduled to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Assessments in this study will look at the capacity of the body before transplantation to see if these measures can help predict how patients do after transplant.
