A Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% on AK on Face or Scalp
This Phase III study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment in adult participants when applied to an area of skin containing 4-8 stable, clinically typical Actinic Keratosis (AK) lesions on the face or scalp.
Actinic Keratoses
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: KX2-391 Ointment 1%
Percentage of Participants With Complete (100%) Clearance of Actinic Keratosis (AK) Lesions, Complete clearance rate was defined as the percentage of participants at Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area., Day 57
Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance Rate of Actinic Keratosis Lesions at Day 57, Partial clearance rate of AK lesions was defined as the percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to (\>=) 75% reduction in the number of AK lesions identified at Baseline (Day 1 predose) in the treatment area., Day 57|Overall Change From Baseline in Actinic Keratosis Lesion Counts at Days 8, 15, 29 and 57, Overall the change from baseline in lesion count at each visit were summarized and reported using descriptive statistics by treatment location (face or scalp)., Days 8, 15, 29 and 57|Percentage of Participants With Recurrence of Actinic Keratosis Lesions Who Achieved Complete Clearance at Day 57, Recurrence rate was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier method, with recurrence define as appearance of any AK lesions in the treatment area, including those recurred or newly identified., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-Day 57|Number of Participants With Maximal Post Baseline Local Skin Reaction (LSR), Maximal post baseline LSR was defined as the highest grade of any LSR reported at any post baseline visits for a participant. The LSR assessment was an Investigator's (or sub-investigator's) assessment of the following signs on the treatment area: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration. The LSRs were graded on a 4-point scale ranging from 0=absent, 1=mild (slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense)., Day 57|Number of Participants With Pigmentation and Scarring in the Treatment Area, Absence or presence of pigmentation (i.e., hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation) and scarring in the treatment area were assessed., Baseline (Day 1 predose), Days 5, 8, 15, 29 and 57|Number of Participants With Adverse Event (AE), Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Events of Special Interests, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participant which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of medicinal product, whether or not considered related to medicinal product. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life threatening; required persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in initial or prolonged in patient hospitalization; was congenital anomaly/birth defect or otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs (serious and non-serious) were defined as either those AEs with onset after first dose or those pre-existing AEs that worsen after first dose. Events of special interest included skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and their location and treatment area), ocular exposure, overdose, and pregnancy., Baseline (Day 1 predose) up to Day 57|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Events of Special Interests Within the Treatment Area After Day 57 and up to 12 Months Post-Day 57, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life threatening; required persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in initial or prolonged in patient hospitalization; was congenital anomaly/birth defect or otherwise considered medically important. Events of special interest included skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and their location and treatment area), ocular exposure, overdose, and pregnancy., From Day 57 up to 12-months post-Day 57|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Safety Observations- Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis, Assessed laboratory parameters included hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis. Clinical significance and abnormal observations were determined by the investigator., From Baseline (Day 1 predose) up to Day 57|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Safety Observations- Vital Signs, Vital signs included measurement of pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Clinical significance was determined by the investigator., From Baseline (Day 1 predose) up to Day 57|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Safety Observations- Physical Examination, A physical examination included weight and height measurements was performed. Clinical significance was determined by the investigator., From Baseline (Day 1 predose) up to Day 57|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Safety Observations- Electrocardiograms (ECGs), ECG parameters included heart rhythm, heart rate, QRS intervals, QT intervals, RR intervals and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Clinical significance was determined by the investigator., From Baseline (Day 1 predose) up to Day 57
This study was a double-blinded, multicenter, activity, and safety study of KX2-391 Ointment administered topically to the face or scalp of participants with actinic keratosis.

The study consists of Screening, Treatment, Follow-up, and Recurrence Follow-up Periods. Eligible participants received 5 consecutive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the study site. Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations was performed.
