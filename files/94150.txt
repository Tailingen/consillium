DRUG: AMG 337
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 337 by reviewing clinically significant or â‰¥ Grade 3 changes in safety laboratory tests, physical examinations, ECGs, or vitals signs in all subjects enrolled., 4 years|Characterize the pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 when administered orally. PK parameters will include, but are not limited to, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)., 4 years|Determine the maximum tolerated dose of AMG 337, if possible. The MTD is defined at the highest dose level with an observed incidence of dose limiting toxicity in < 33% of subjects enrolled in a cohort., 4 years
