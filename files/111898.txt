Preemptive Ethanol Lock Therapy in Pediatric Bloodstream Infection
The study team will compare hospital length of stay (LOS) and attributable length of stay (ALOS, the LOS attributable to CRI), in a randomized, un-blinded prospective trial utilizing short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy (ELT) (4 hours to 24 hour dwell times per day, repeated for up to 72 hours) placed within 24 - 36 hours of admission(Group 1, Preemptive ELT) versus ELT placed at the time of first positive blood culture report (Group 2, Rescue ELT (Standard of Care ). ELT will be given in both groups, in combination with systemic antibiotics, for the treatment of CRI (suspected or proven) of the blood in children with central catheters. Participants will be enrolled from patients with hematologic/oncologic disorders and bone marrow or hematopoetic stem cell transplants (BMT) admitted for care to Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Detroit, Michigan. ALOS will be defined as the number of hospital days between first symptoms of Catheter-related infection (CRI) (or date of admission for those admitted with symptoms) and first negative blood culture.

Study Hypothesis: The main hypothesis is that the short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy, defined above, placed within 24 - 36 hours of symptoms/admission (Arm 1) versus ELT placement at the time of first positive blood culture report (Arm 2), with concomitant systemic antibiotics, for the treatment of CRI (suspected or proven) of the blood in children with central catheters in the H/O/BMT population will have shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) and attributable LOS (ALOS) and therefore lower hospital costs.

Length of Stay (LOS) in Those With 14 Confirmed Catheter Related Infection Cases, A primary endpoint of this study is length of stay (LOS) per catheter infection episode/admission, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks|Attributable Length of Stay (ALOS) in 14 Confirmed Catheter Related Infection Cases, TIME FROM FIRST POSITIVE TO FIRST NEGATIVE BLOOD CULTURE, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks|Hospital COSTS in 14 Confirmed Catheter Related Infection Cases, Hospital COSTS, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks
Catheter Sterilization, Number of Catheters sterilized with interventions, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks|Catheter Salvage, Number of Infected catheters (which achieved sterilization) with salvage for at least 14 days., Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks|Number of Adverse Events Per Episode of Catheter Infection, Number of Adverse events per episode of distinct catheter infection that are thought to be related to the actual study intervention, namely timing of ethanol lock placement, will be reviewed and reported for each individual infection episode/admission., Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks but up to 1 month post the last ethanol dose administration|Re-infection, Number of Re-Infected of salvaged catheters with same or new organism(s) within 28 days of prior CRI/ELT, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks but for up to 1 month total
The study team will compare hospital length of stay (LOS) and attributable length of stay (ALOS, the LOS attributable to CRI), in a randomized, un-blinded prospective trial utilizing short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy (ELT) (4 hours to 24 hour dwell times per day, repeated for up to 72 hours) placed within 24 - 36 hours of admission(Group 1, Preemptive ELT) versus ELT placed at the time of first positive blood culture report (Group 2, Rescue ELT (Standard of Care ).

ELT will be given in both groups, in combination with systemic antibiotics, for the treatment of Catheter-related Infection (CRI) (suspected or proven) of the blood in children with central catheters. Participants will be enrolled from patients with hematologic/oncologic disorders and bone marrow or hematopoetic stem cell transplants admitted for care to Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Detroit, Michigan. ALOS will be defined as the number of hospital days between first symptoms of CRI (or date of admission for those admitted with symptoms) and first negative blood culture.

Aim 1: Compare two different treatment regimens for CRI using ELT (the preemptive ELT vs. standard of care) by way of a prospective, randomized, two-arm study.

Study Hypothesis: The main hypothesis is that the short-dwell ethanol-lock therapy, defined above, placed within 24 - 36 hours of symptoms/admission (Arm 1) versus ELT placement at the time of first positive blood culture report (Arm 2), with concomitant systemic antibiotics, for the treatment of CRI (suspected or proven) of the blood in children with central catheters in the H/O/BMT population will have shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) and attributable LOS (ALOS) and therefore lower hospital costs.

Aim 2: Compare sterilization rate of the infected intravascular device after ethanol-lock therapy (as defined by a negative blood culture obtained from the infected catheter 24 - 72 hours after ELT) and central catheter salvage rate after CRI using ELT in the two study arms. If the central catheter is salvaged for further clinical use, recurrence of infection with the same organism (re-infection) of the central catheter for 28 days from date of first ELT procedure will also be assessed.

Aim 3: Assess tolerability and adverse effects of the ELT (safety).

Aim 4: Perform sub-group analysis on the BSI episodes meeting National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria for laboratory confirmed central line associated BSI (CLABSI) into the three categories of Criteria 1, 2 or 3 within the pediatric
