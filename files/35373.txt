Oxaliplatin Plus Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumor
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: oxaliplatin
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine when administered in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. II. Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
