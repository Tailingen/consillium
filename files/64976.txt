Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was calculated as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the total number of participants in the analysis population per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 as determined by the local investigators., Up to 4.5 years
Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response (DOR) is defined as the time from first documented evidence of confirmed CR or confirmed PR until first documented date of disease progression or death due to any cause or surgical resection or start of prohibited medications. Duration of overall response was evaluated per RECIST v1.1. Median and full range of DOR are presented., Up to 4.5 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the interval between the date of first T cell infusion and the earliest documented evidence of disease progression or death due to any cause or surgical resection or start of prohibited medications. Progression free survival was evaluated per RECIST v1.1. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of progression free survival are presented., Up to 4.5 years|Best Overall Response, Best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment (first T cell infusion) until disease progression/recurrence. Response categories from best to worst are confirmed CR, confirmed PR, stable disease (SD) and confirmed progressive disease (PD). Best overall response is a stable disease, if CR or PR are unconfirmed. Data for number of participants with CR, PR, SD and PD are presented., Up to 4.5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval between the date of the first T-cell infusion and date of death from any cause. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of overall survival are presented., Up to 4.5 years|Number of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events (Non-SAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that; results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, other situations judged by physician, is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function. Number of participants who had non-SAEs and SAEs are presented., Up to 5 years|Number of Participants With Worst Post-Baseline Grade Results for Hematology Parameters, Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters.

The assay involved screening, confirmation and titration steps. If serum samples tested positive in the screening assay, they were considered 'potentially positive' and were further analyzed for the specificity using the confirmation assay.

The correlation between cytokines and cytokine release syndrome was considered between participants who had serious CRS vs no CRS or Non-serious CRS. There were only 4 participants across the whole study that had serious CRS and cytokine data was available for 3 of these participants. Due to the limited number of participants that had serious CRS no statistical correlations in cytokine levels and CRS could be performed.

* Patients will undergo apheresis at the enrolling institution. PBMC will be shipped to a central manufacturer for gene transduction, activation and expansion, then cryopreserved and shipped back to the enrolling institution.
* The trial seeks to enroll up to 65 patients, that is, up to 20 patients in Cohort 1 and up to 15 patients in Cohorts 2-4. Depending on the cohort patients are enrolled in, patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine.

  * Cohort 1: Complete
  * Cohort 2: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -3 and -2, and without fludarabine on Days -5 and -4.

  * Cohort 4: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 5 evaluable patients treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine on Days -7 to -5.

* Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and immune endpoints.
* Patients who have a confirmed response, or have stable disease for \>3 months then progress may receive a 2nd T cell infusion, provided eligibility criteria are met. The 2nd treatment cell infusion will be administered in the same manner as the first. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria may receive a 2nd infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T no sooner than 60 days and no later than 2 years following completion of the first treatment.
