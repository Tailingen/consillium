Hematologic Malignancy|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Entospletinib|DRUG: Daunorubicin|DRUG: Cytarabine
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory Abnormalities Defined as Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Occurrence of any of the following toxicities, attributable to ENTO, during Cycle 1 was considered DLT:

* Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity except alopecia, nausea, and vomiting controllable with anti-emetic therapy, line associated venous thrombosis, infection-related toxicities such as fever/sepsis, and fatigue.
* In participants without bone marrow evidence of hematologic malignancy, hematologic toxicity defined as failure to recover absolute neutrophil count (ANC \> 500/μL) or platelet count (\>25000/μL) within 28 days
* Grade 4, clinically significant, electrolyte abnormalities that were not correctable within 24 hours
* Liver function test abnormalities that did not resolve to Grade 2 within 10 days
* Infection that resulted from unexpectedly complicated prolonged myelosuppression
* Toxicities that required temporary interruption of treatment and did not resolve to Grade 2 within 10 days or ENTO was suspended or dose reduced for a period of more than 10 days., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle)
Percentage of Participants With AEs and Laboratory Abnormalities Not Defined as DLT, Day 1 Up to 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study treatment (maximum approximately 80 weeks)|Plasma Concentration of ENTO, Plasma concentration of drug (ENTO) over different time points is reported., Cycle 1 (28-days cycle) Day 8 at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose
