Study of Pembrolizumab Combined With Decitabine and Pralatrexate in PTCL and CTCL
This is an international, multicenter, multi-arm, phase Ib, model-based dose-escalation study. The primary objectives of the study in each arm is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to evaluate the clinical efficacy at the MTD of various combinations of pembrolizumab, pralatrexate and decitabine.
PTCL|CTCL
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pralatrexate|DRUG: Decitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The study dose level that is recommended after the maximum target sample size of 10 participants are accrued to each arm, 1-2 years|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Only DLT's that occur prior to the initiation of cycle 2 will be used to determine dose escalation/de-escalation decisions. DLT criteria are defined as any non-hematologic toxicity greater and/or equal to grade 3 except for exceptions outlined in the protocol., 1-2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluate the efficacy, as determined by the ORR (complete + partial response) for each Arm, 1-2 years
Anti-tumor activity, Describe the anti-tumor activity of the combinations in each Arm., 1-2 years|ORR, PFS, DOR, Evaluate the efficacy, as determined by the overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) for each Arm., 1-2 years|Pharmacodynamic markers, Evaluate pharmacodynamic markers of drug effect in paired tissue biopsies (pre- and post-treatment)., 1-2 years|Pharmacokinetic Profile, Establish pharmacokinetic profile for pembrolizumab when administered with pralatrexate (Arm A), with decitabine (Arm C) and when given as a combination (Arm B) during cycle 1 only., 1-2 years
The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are rare subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with unique clinicopathologic features and very unfavorable prognosis. Recently it has been demonstrated that PTCLs are characterized by recurrent mutations in epigenetic operators (e.g. TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH2) and escape from immune surveillance.

The safety and toxicity of these combinations will be evaluated throughout the entire study. Dose allocation in Arms A and C will be based upon a continual reassessment method (CRM), and combination allocation in Arm B will be conducted using a DLT-adapted partial order continual reassessment method (POCRM) for dose-finding with combinations of agents.

Study Hypothesis: If pralatrexate and/or decitabine functions in an immunomodulatory fashion then priming and modulating the malignant cells and the microenvironment will enhance the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in patients with PTCLs and CTCLs.
