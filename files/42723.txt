Treatment De-Escalation for Favorable Prognosis Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) or p16-Positive Oropharyngeal Cancer Receiving Definitive Radiotherapy
The current standard treatment option for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) or p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer is full-dose radiation combined with chemotherapy. Results with chemotherapy combined with full-dose radiation therapy leads to high rates of cure; this has called into question whether therapy can be decreased in intensity since both chemotherapy and radiation have long-term side effects. One approach to decrease intensity of treatment is to give radiation alone (excluding chemotherapy) and to decrease radiation therapy dose. The investigator believes that omitting chemotherapy and decreasing radiation dose both to tumor and the regions of the head and neck at highest risk of potential spread, may have no significant impact on the cancer recurring while potentially leading to fewer long-term side effects.

This study aims to estimate the efficacy of radiation dose de-escalation while omitting chemotherapy for favorable prognosis HPV or p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients receiving definitive radiation therapy, where efficacy is measured by 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate after treatment de-escalation for low-risk HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This study also aims to determine quality of life parameters, complete clinical and radiographic response, as well as local, regional and distant metastasis control as well as overall survival.
