Efficacy and Safety of Recombinant Human Endostatin in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Leptomeningeal Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to observe the clinical effect and safety of Recombinant Human Endostatin in non-small cell lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis
Leptomeningeal Metastasis
DRUG: Recombinant Human Endostatin|DRUG: intrathcal methotrexate|DRUG: Targeted drugs for non-small cell lung cancer
Leptomeningeal Metastasis Overall survival, Leptomeningeal Metastasis Overall survival defined as time from LM diagnosis to death due to any cause or last follow-up, 36 months|Neurological Progression Free Survival, From the start of treatment until central nervous system metastase progression or death due to any cause, 36 months|The incidence of adverse reactions, From date of first dose up to assessed from April 2020 to April 2023 (In accordance with the standard of CTCAE), 36 months
Objective Response Rate, ORR, proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response (CR+PR), 36 months|Neurological assessment, In accordance with the standard of Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology(RANO) Neurological Assessment group.The maximum value is 29 and the minimum value is 0.The higher scores mean a worse outcome., 36 months|progression-free survival, Proportion of patients progression-free by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, 36 months|Overall survival, defined as time from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer diagnosis to death due to any cause or last follow-up, 36 months
The purpose of this study is to observe the clinical effect and safety of Recombinant Human Endostatin in non-small cell lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis
