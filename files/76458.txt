BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire
Women Endorsing Prenatal Diagnostic Testing (Questionnaire response), Baseline and post genetic testing (results disclosure) at 3-4 weeks
This questionnaire is part of a study at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The purpose is to ask women who are seeking genetic testing for HBOC their viewpoints surrounding fertility, childbearing and parenting, both at the time of testing and at the time of results disclosure. The aim is to evaluate if the genetics results disclosure may influence women's views regarding these topics. Researchers hope to use this information to provide more information to the patient and the caregiver to help both parties with this very important cancer survivorship issue.
