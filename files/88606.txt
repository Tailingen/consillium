XmAb®20717 (Vudalimab) Alone or in Combination With Chemotherapy or Targeted Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This Phase 2 study will investigate the safety and clinical activity of vudalimab (XmAb20717) alone or in combination with standard of care anticancer therapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on prior therapy.

Detailed Description:

This is a Phase 2, open-label, multiple-dose, multiple-arm, parallel assignment study in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior therapy. It will enroll subjects into 1 of 5 molecularly defined cohorts based on the results of acceptable, documented prior diagnostic testing:

* Cohort A: Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPCa)
* Cohort B: Homologous recombination deficient (HRD)/cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) biallelic loss tumors that have progressed on poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors (HRD/CDK12 PARP Progressors) - Closed to Enrollment
* Cohort C: HRD/CDK12 biallelic loss tumors, naive to PARP inhibitors (HRD/CDK12 PARP Naïve) - Closed to Enrollment
* Cohort D: Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (MMRD), or tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) tumors - Closed to Enrollment
* Cohort E: No Targetable Mutations
