A Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacokinetic Profile of HLX17 Vs. Keytruda® in the First-Line Treatment of Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled integrated phase I/III clinical study to evaluate the similarity in efficacy, safety, PK profile, and immunogenicity of HLX17 vs. Keytruda®( US- and EU-sourced) in the first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

This study includes three treatment groups. Patients will be randomly assigned at a 2:1:1 ratio to the HLX17, US-sourced Keytruda® and EU-sourced Keytruda® group to receive the treatment of IMPs in combination with Carboplatin Plus Pemetrexed until disease progression, initiation of new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent form, death, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 17 cycles (whichever occurs first).
