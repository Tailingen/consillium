A Study With Central Nervous System Metastatic EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a descriptive observational study, in which data are collected in an epidemiological fashion and prospective. This study does not intend to intervene the current medical practice of the recruited patients.
NSCLC
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from beginning of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., 2 years
Central nervous system (CNS) progression-free survival, CNS PFS is defined as the time from beginning of study treatment until the date of objective progression of central nervous system or death (by any cause in the absence of CNS progression), regardless of whether the patient withdraws from study treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., 2 years|Objective Response Rate, Defined as the number (%) of patients with response of Complete Response or Partial Response, 2 years
This is a descriptive observational study, in which data are collected in an EGFR mutant NSCLC. Our research plan aims to use multi-omics approaches to predict the likelihood of patients developing brain metastases, assess the prognosis of brain metastasis treatment, and identify potential biomarkers.
