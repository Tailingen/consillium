A Study of Capecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Combination With Pre-operative Pelvic Radiotherapy in Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the pathological complete tumor response rate.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Tumor Response, Pathological complete tumor response was defined as grade 3 or 4 in the histological grading of regression according to Dworak classification. Grade 0 is no regression; Grade 1 is dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy; Grade 2 is dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumor cells or groups; Grade 3 is defined as very few (difficult to find microscopically) tumor cells in fibrotic tissue with or without mucous substance; Grade 4 is defined as no tumor cells, only fibrotic mass (total regression or response)., Up to Week 16
Percentage of Participants With Sphincter-preservation, Percentage of participants with sphincter-preservation is reported., Up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Marked Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with marked laboratory abnormalities is reported., Up to Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Resection (R0) in Participants With T4 Rectal Cancer, R0 resection was defined as complete resection of the tumor with adequate tumor-free margins and regional lymph node extirpation as confirmed by pathology after pre-operative chemotherapy plus capecitabine + oxaliplatin therapy., Up to Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Downstaging of Primary Tumor and/or Lymph Nodes, Downstaging of primary tumor (T) and/or lymph nodes (N) was defined as decrease by 1 point in T-value and/or N-value (comparing at screening and after treatment). It was assessed by colonoscopy, pathology, endosonography of rectum, chest X-ray, abdominopelvic Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Staging for tumor are: TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed), T0 (no evidence of primary tumor), Tis (carcinoma in situ), T1 (tumor invades submucosa), T2 (tumor invades muscularis propria), T3 (tumor invades through muscularis propria into subserosa/into non-peritonealized pericolic/perirectal tissues, T4 (tumor directly invades other organs or structures). Staging for lymph nodes are: NX (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed), N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis), N1 (metastasis in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes), N2 (metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes)., From screening to Week 16|Percentage of Participants With Pathological Incomplete Tumor Response, Pathological incomplete tumor response was defined as grade 1 or 2 in the histological grading of regression according to Dworak grading of regression. Pathological incomplete tumor response rate, Grade 1: dominant tumor mass with obvious fibrosis and/or vasculopathy; Grade 2: dominantly fibrotic changes with few tumor cells or groups (easy to find) were assessed., Up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants or clinical investigation participants administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect., Up to Week 16
The purpose of this study is to determine the pathological complete tumor response rate.
