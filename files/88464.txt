Screening for Cancer in Patients With Unprovoked VTE
Open and multicenter randomized clinical trial (1:1) comparing limited screening with extended screening with the performance of Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan in the search for neoplasms in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease at high risk of developing cancer at follow-up.

Introduction: Cancer screening in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is controversial. In the last years, a score has been developed that selects patients at high risk of developing cancer during follow-up.

Objective: To estimate the impact of an active cancer search strategy using 18-fluordesoxiglucose (FDG) PET-CT in unprovoked VTE with high-risk to develop cancer.

Specific Objectives: 1) Number of neoplasms diagnosed in the screening process: 2) number of neoplasms diagnosed at an early stage, 3) impact on survival of the strategy; and 4) impact on the quality of life.

Cancer will be considered from 30 days up to 12 months after the diagnosis of VTE.

Scope: 20 Spanish hospitals. Design: Open-label, multicentre Randomized clinical trial (1: 1) comparing the performance of PET-CT versus limited screening for cancer.

Population: Patients older than 18 years with unprovoked VTE at high risk of presenting cancer at follow-up (≥3 points in the score of Jara-Palomares et al., Chest 2017).

Follow-up: 12 months after VTE. Sample: The sample size calculated is 650 patients, to obtain a power of 80%, with a level of significance of 5%, and taking into account a 10% loss of follow-up.

The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts - the "Descriptive System" and the "Visual Analogue scale". The DS comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.

The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents., Baseline and after 90, 180 and 365 days of follow-up
