Outcomes After Secondary Cytoreductive Surgery With or Without Carboplatin Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) Followed by Systemic Combination Chemotherapy for Recurrent Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can improve the treatment of this type of cancer. They want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, giving heated chemotherapy into the belly, known as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), has on the patient and this type of cancer.

The goal of HIPEC is to expose any cancer left in the abdomen after surgery to high doses of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is heated in the hope that this will make it easier for it to get into and kill the cancer cells. The drug used for HIPEC will be carboplatin, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for use in ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

determine the proportion of patients who are without evidence of disease progression, A proportion of patients ≥ 40%, who are without evidence of disease progression at 24 months, is considered acceptable, whereas a proportion of ≤ 25% is considered not acceptable in this patient population., 24 months
To determine the toxicity and postoperative complications rate, The safety endpoint of our trial is to determine toxicity and postoperative complication rates in both arms using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. and MSKCC Surgical Secondary Events Grading System for complications., 4 weeks post op|determine the completion rate of four cycles, A secondary analysis of estimating the completion rate will be conducted. The completion rate and a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for each arm separately. Completion is defined as patients being able to complete ≥ 4 out of 5 or 6 cycles of a standard systemic chemotherapy., 5 years|pharmacokinetics, in a subset of patients randomized to receive HIPEC in the OR. In patients randomized to HIPEC, peritoneal fluid and blood samples only from MSKCC patients will be drawn before, during and after the HIPEC procedure., 5 years
