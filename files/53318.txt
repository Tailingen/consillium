An Epidemiologic Study on PD-L1 Expression Combined With Clinical Observation in the Chinese MIUBC Patients.
The Primary Objective of this observational study is to investigate the prevalence of high PD-L1 expression in Chinese MIUBC patients.
Urinary Bladder Cancer
the prevalence of High PD-L1 expression in the MIUBC patients, Tumor tissue will be collected from all eligible patients who sign the ICF. Samples will be tested for PD-L1 expression status., Tumor tissue samples should be acquired within 60 days before the enrollment and available for testing.
Proportion of patients with different PD-L1 expression level, Proportion of patients with different PD-L1 expression level, Tumor tissue samples should be acquired within 60 days before the enrollment and available for testing.|PD-L1 testing concordance between central lab and hospital labs, PD-L1 testing concordance between central lab and hospital labs, Tumor tissue samples should be acquired within 60 days before the enrollment and available for testing.|Distribution percent of different treatment approaches, Distribution percent of different treatment approaches, enrollment visit|2-year OS, follow up for OS up to 2 years from the baseline, From enrollment to OS, up to 2 years
The prevalence of PD-L1 expression by subgroups, The prevalence of PD-L1 expression by subgroups according to age, gender, primary tumor site, metastatic disease, at baseline, and prior tobacco use, etc, enrollment visit|OS by subgroups, OS by subgroups according to age, gender, primary tumor site, metastatic disease at baseline and the PD-L1 expression of high and low/negative as well as other biomarkers, etc. Simple correlation coefficients among biomarkers including PD-L1 with TMB, PD-L1 with CD8+ T cell, PD-L1+ IC with CD8+ T cell., from enrollment to OS, up to 2 years|Simple correlation coefficients among biomarkers, Simple correlation coefficients among biomarkers including PD-L1 with TMB, PD-L1 with CD8+ T cell, PD-L1 positive IC with CD8+ T cell., enrollment visit
The primary objective of this observational study is:

•To investigate the prevalence of high PD-L1 expression in Chinese MIUBC patients. High PD-L1 expression is defined as ≥25% tumor cell membrane positivity for PD-L1 at any intensity above background staining as noted on the corresponding negative control OR ≥25% tumor associated immune cell positivity for PD-L1 at any intensity above background staining as noted on the corresponding negative control.

Note: PD-L1 High (\>=25% tumor cell membrane positivity for PD-L1 or 1) IF IC area \>1%: \>=25% tumor associated immune cell positivity for PD-L1; 2) If IC area=1%: 100% tumor associated immune cell positivity for PD-L1). PD-L1 Low if criteria not met for PD-L1 High.

The second objectives of this observational study are:

* To investigate the PD-L1 expression profile in TC or IC in Chinese MIUBC patients.
* To assess the concordance of PD-L1 testing results generated from the hospital labs with those from the central lab.
* To observe the initial treatment pattern for MIUBC patients in usual clinical practice in China.
* To observe 2-year OS of the Chinese MIUBC patients.

The exploratory objectives of this observational study are:

* To explore the relationship between the demographic characteristics and expression of PD-L1 and other exploratory biomarkers including immune cell (IC) subset CD8+ T cells and tumor mutation burden (TMB).
* To explore the relationship between OS and the demographic characteristics as well as the expression of biomarkers.
* To explore the relationship between PD-L1 and TMB, PD-L1 and CD8 positive T cell respectively.
