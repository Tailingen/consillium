Fertility-sparing Therapy for Patients With Stage IA Endometrial Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the feasibility and outcome of fertility-sparing therapy in Stage IA G1-G2 Endometrial Cancer with less than 1/2 myometrial invasion. Researchers will render participants indication-extended fertility-sparing therapy. Researchers will compare the myometrial invasion group with the no myometrial invasion group to see if it is possible to propose an extension indication of fertility-sparing therapy for endometrial cancer.

The study population is patients with Stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma with no myometrial invasion or less than 1/2 myometrial invasion. The sample size is 57 cases (Myometrial invasion group : No myometrial invasion group = 1 : 2). Follow up every 3-6 months until the end of the fifth year of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the complete remission rate after 9 months of treatment. Secondary outcome measures include complete remission rate (6 months/12 months after initial treatment), complete remission time, recurrence rate (1 year/2 years after complete remission), recurrence time, pregnancy rate (1 year after complete remission), pregnancy outcome, blood molecular biomarkers, pathological markers, adverse reactions, etc.
