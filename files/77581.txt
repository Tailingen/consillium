A Study of Duvelisib Combined With SG001 Injection in Patient With Advanced Solid Tumors
Study will be conducted with 2 stages.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Duvelisib|DRUG: SG001
DLT, Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity, up to week 6|TEAEs, Number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, up to approximately 2 years|AEs, Number of patients with treatment-related Adverse Events, up to approximately 2 years
ORR, Objective Response Rate, up to approximately 2 years|DOR, Duration of response, up to approximately 2 years|DCR, Disease control rate, up to approximately 2 years|PFS, Progression Free survival, up to approximately 2 years|OS, Overall Survival, up to approximately 2 years
AUC, Area Under Curve, up to approximately 2 years|Cmax, Maximum concentration, up to approximately 2 years|The correlation of biomarkers with efficacy, The correlation of PIK3CA, AKT mutations, TMB and PD-L1 expression and other biomarkers with the efficacy of duvelisib will be assessed., up to approximately 2 years
The first stage will explore the suitable dose of duvelisib when combined with SG001 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed with prior systemic therapy.

The second stage will explore the safety and tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor efficacy and PK data of duvelisib monotherapy and combo regime with SG001 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors which will including but not limited with esophageal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous carcinoma.
