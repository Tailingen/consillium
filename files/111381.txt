Evaluation of PET/MRI in Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This study will use PET/MRI in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to identify hidden metastatic disease or identify patients with borderline or locally advanced disease.
Adenocarcinoma Pancreas
PROCEDURE: PET/MRI
PET/MRI compared to conventional CT and MRI, Primary outcome is to determine if the primary tumor and the margins of anatomical land marks from the PET/MRI imaging is more precise and gives a clearer picture of tumor location than standard care, CT or MRI. Both standard of care imaging and this new technology will be compared to the final pathologic analysis, measuring the true distance (in mm) between the primary tumor and margins. Data will be reported as mm., Up to several months or longer. Patient will undergo research imaging with each standard of care scan they have.
Resectability post neoadjuvant treatment, The secondary outcome is to determine if PET/MRI imaging is better than standard of care imaging (CT or MRI) after patients have received chemotherapy and to determine if they are surgical candidates. The objective is to determine if the primary tumor and the margins of anatomical land marks from the PET/MRI imaging is more precise and gives a clearer picture of tumor location than standard care, CT or MRI. Both standard of care imaging and this new technology will be compared to the final pathologic analysis, measuring the true distance (in mm) between the primary tumor and margins. Data will be reported as mm., Several months or as deemed a surgical candidate by physician.
Patients will receive a PET/MRI scan within 6 weeks of their standard of care imaging. There is no maximum number of scans for research. The number of scans depends on each patient's treatment plan.
