A Study of Nivolumab Plus Chemotherapy in First Line Treatment of Adult Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this observational study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of nivolumab in participants with previously untreated advanced or metastatic Gastric Cancer (GC), Gastro-oesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma, or Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma (EAC).
Gastric Cancer

Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as time since initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab to either the first disease progression date or last known tumour assessment date, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as investigator assessed complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease., From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Duration of response, Defined as time from response to progression, From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as time since initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause., From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months|OS measured by Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS), From initial diagnosis and treatment with nivolumab until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 36 months
