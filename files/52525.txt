Development of a Molecular Diagnostic Tool for Endometrial Cancer.
WomEC is an in vitro diagnostic test for Endometrial Cancer (EC) based on the detection of the expression level of a combination of 5 proteins in the soluble fraction of a pipelle biopsy specimen. The aim of the study consists in validating WomEC's ELISA test, creating and freezing an algorithm to rule out EC in post-menopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).
