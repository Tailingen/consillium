Evaluation of a New Anti-cancer Immunotherapy in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With a Suboptimal Clinical Response to Induction Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of a WT1 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (WT1 ASCI) as post-induction therapy in adult patients with WT1-positive AML presenting a suboptimal clinical response to induction chemotherapy. The study will also assess whether this treatment induces a specific immune response to the malignancy.

Number of Patients With Severe Toxicities, Severe toxicities (as classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0) during the study treatment period defined as a study product-related or possibly study product-related:

* Grade 4 toxicity (exception: study product-related or possibly study product-related Grade 4 fatigue - including lethargy, asthenia, and malaise - had to have a duration of at least 48 hours to be taken into account).
* Grade 3 toxicity lasting for at least 48 hours (exceptions: myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and fever, regardless of duration).
* Grade 2 toxicity (i.e., rash, flushing, urticaria, and dyspnea). Drug fever was not part of this definition.
* Decrease in renal function, with a calculated creatinine clearance \< 40 mL/min.
* Grade 2 cardiac ischemia/infarction (i.e., asymptomatic and testing suggesting ischemia; stable angina)., During the entire study (from Month 0 to Month 49)|Number of Patients With Best Overall Response, Defined by Either Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD), CR = having \< 5% blasts in aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a count of ≥ 200 nucleated cells, no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease; different phenotype (by flow cytometry) to the pre-treatment specimen; absolute neutrophil count \> 1000/mm3; platelet count ≥ 100 000/mm3 and being independent of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.

PR = a decrease of ≤ 50% in the % of blasts in bone marrow aspirate compared to Visit 4; being independent of RBC transfusions and the absolute neutrophil ≥ 1000/mm3 and platelet counts and ≥ 100 000/mm3.

SD = no sufficient criteria for CR, a PR or Progressive disease (PD = Reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood; Reappearance/development of cytologically proven extramedullary disease, Appearance of new dysplastic changes, or in a bone marrow aspirate sample (with marrow spicules and with a count of ≥200 nucleated cells) of ≥5% blasts; or, in case of early progression, a higher blast % than at Visit 4)., During the entire study (from Month 0 to Month 49)
Anti-WT1 Seropositivity Rate, Seropositivity rate was defined as the number of patients with anti-WT1 antibody concentrations greater than or equal to (≥) 9 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) units per milliliter (EU/mL)., At baseline (PRE), weeks (W) 5, 9, 13, 15, 21, 32, 40, 54, at months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 49 (concluding visit), as well as follow-up visits 1 to 4|Anti-WT1 Antibody Concentrations, Antibody concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations, measured in ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL)., At baseline (PRE), weeks (W) 5, 9, 13, 15, 21, 32, 40, 54, at months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 49 (concluding visit), as well as follow-up visits 1 to 4|Anti-WT1 Antibody Response, The anti-WT1 antibody response was defined as:

For initially seronegative patients, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 9 EU/mL; For initially seropositive patients, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 2 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration., At baseline (PRE), weeks (W) 5, 9, 13, 15, 21, 32, 40, 54, at months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 49 (concluding visit), as well as follow-up visits 1 to 4|Number of Subjects With Any and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs), An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study treatment., Starting with the first administration of study treatment and ending 30 days after the last study treatment administration|Number of Subjects With Study Treatment Failure, Study treatment failure was defined as withdrawal from investigational product because of disease progression or death. Among the characteristics evaluated were: Progression, Death in absence of Relapse, Relapse or progression or Death (Progression Free Survival event), Death \[An event that was part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) was captured in the study as an efficacy measure; therefore it did not need to be reported as an SAE\], Autopsy performed and Cause of death., During the entire study (from Month 0 to Month 49)|Number of Subjects With Any or Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Related = SAE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study treatment. An event that was part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) was captured in the study as an efficacy measure, therefore, it did not need to be reported as an SAE. Death due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form in the CRF, but not as an SAE., During the entire study (from Month 0 to Month 49)|Number of Patients With Abnormal Hematological and Biochemical Parameters, Haematological and biochemical parameters assessed were Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, Alkaline Phosphatase, Bilirubin, Creatinine, Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, Hemoglobin, Hypercalcemia, Hyperkalemia, Hypernatremia, Hypoalbuminemia, Hypocalcemia, Hypokalemia, Hyponatremia, Leukocytes, Lymphopenia, Neutrophils, Platelets and Proteinuria. Parameters were assessed as per the Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), where Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe but not life-threatening and Grade 4 = life-threatening., During the entire study (Month 0 to Month 49)
At least 40 patients will be enrolled in this study, divided in two cohorts of 20 patients each. One cohort will include patients in partial remission after induction therapy and one cohort will include patients in complete remission but with incomplete blood count recovery. Patients in both cohorts will receive the same study treatment according to the same administration schedule.

This protocol summary has been updated according to the Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 10 Sept 2014).

All active follow-up visits and procedures after the concluding visit, 30 days after the last treatment administration, will be stopped In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.
