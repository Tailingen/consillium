Screening For BCRL In Targeted Therapy For Breast Cancer
This a prospective, longitudinal study designed to track edema and Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema (BCRL) onset in breast cancer patients taking targeted therapy treatments for early and metastatic breast cancer.

A Perometer and Sozo devise will be used to measure volume changes

Proportion of participants with a greater than or equal to 10% arm volume change from the first pre-treatment (targeted therapy) measurement, detected by perometry, occurring at least three months after breast surgery, Greater than or equal to 10% arm volume change from the first pre-treatment (targeted therapy) measurement, detected by perometry, occurring at least three months after breast surgery, At least three months post surgery up to 5 years, assessed every 3 months
To assess the time course to lymphedema onset, We will also attempt to look at any time course differences of lymphedema onset by plotting cumulative incidence curves of the study and control groups and comparing hazard rates after accounting for important covariates in a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model., 5 Years|To asses the correlation of different targeted therapies with lymphedema onset, We will compare the incidence of lymphedema by type of targeted therapy drug (CDK4/6, PI3K, mTOR, AKT)., 5 Years
This study will compare patients' relative arm volume changes and symptoms data from before drug therapy throughout drug treatment and for up to six months after treatment has finished.

A Perometer and Sozo device will be used to measure volume changes

All participants will be accrued at Massachusetts General Hospital for a target accrual of 166 participants.
