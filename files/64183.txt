Evaluating the Effect of Nivolumab for Patients With In-transit Metastases Treated With Isolated Limb Perfusion
To evaluate safety and the effect of isolated limb perfusion together with nivolumab as a way to increase efficacy and give further insights in early immunological mechanisms.

In the first phase Ib part, 20 patients will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 3 months. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will continuously review safety and judge the seriousness of the events and also recommend the study to stop if necessary. If the DSMB do not find safety issues, the trial will continue as a phase II trial.
Melanoma|In-Transit Metastasis
DRUG: Nivolumab|PROCEDURE: Isolated limb perfusion (ILP)
Complete response rate (CR), To evaluate if melphalan based isolated limb perfusion (ILP) synergizes with nivolumab in inducing complete responses (CR) at 3 months after treatment in melanoma patients with in-transit metastasis., 3 months
Time to local progression (TTLP), Evaluation of local progression-free survival (LPFS). LPFS is defined as the number of months from the date of ILP to the date of the first documented disease recurrence or progression in the treated area (defined as the area below the tourniquet used for ILP). LPFS will be determined based on clinical assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., 36 months|Distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), Evaluation of DMFS, defined as the number of months from the date of ILP to the date of the first documented distant disease recurrence., 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Evaluation of PFS, defined as the number of months from the date of ILP to the date of the first documented disease recurrence or progression at any site., 36 months|Melanoma specific survival (MSS), Evaluation of melanoma specific survival (MSS), MSS is calculated as the time from date of treatment to date of death due to any cause. Both median MSS and the per cent of patients alive at 36 months will be evaluated., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Evaluation of overall survival (OS), OS is calculated as the time from date of treatment to date of death due to any cause. Both median OS and the per cent of patients alive at 36 months will be evaluated., 36 months|Quality of life measured by FACT-M, Quality of life (QoL) by FACT-M. Change from baseline for all subscales as well as for the total scores., 36 months|Quality of life measured by EQ-5D, Quality of life (QoL) by EQ-5D measured as the change from baseline, 36 months
