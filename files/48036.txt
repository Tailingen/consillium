Comparison of Standard Dose Alectinib to Alectinib in Adjusted Dose Based on Alectinib Bloodlevels
The ADAPT ALEC randomized controlled trial (RCT) is performed in patients with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The RCT will compare the use of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) and dose increases if alectinib 35 ng/Ml (arm A) with standard of care (arm B).

The ADAPT ALEC trial is a phase IV, RCT in patients with ALK positive NSCLC treated with alectinib. A longer median progression free survival (mPFS) is expected in patients treated with standard dose alectinib when minimum plasma concentrations (Cmin) of alectinib exceed 435 ng/mL. The ADAPT ALEC trial will investigate whether using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and increasing the dose of alectinib in patients with Cmin \<435 ng/mL, will raise the mPFS. We will compare mPFS in the subgroup of patients with an alectinib Cmin \<435 ng/mL using TDM and dose increases (arm A) to fixed dosing/standard of care (arm B).
