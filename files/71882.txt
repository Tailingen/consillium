Blood Proteins in Predicting Treatment Benefit in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at proteins in blood samples to predict treatment benefit in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: proteomic profiles|OTHER: proteomic profiles
Identification of patients who will benefit from treatment with EGFR and/or VEGF inhibitors based on serum proteomic profiles, upon analysis of each patient tissue collection
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify head and neck squamous cell cancer patients who will benefit from treatment with the EGFR inhibitors (i.e., erlotinib hydrochloride, gefitinib, and cetuximab) and VEGF inhibitor (i.e., bevacizumab), based on predictive proteomic profiles in patient blood samples.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Blood samples are analyzed for proteomic profile to determine good and bad prognoses in patients treated with or without EGFR inhibitors and/or a VEGF inhibitor.
