(PM-01) IMPRIME PGGÂ® With BTH1704 and Gemcitabine for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This Phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate BTH1704, a monoclonal antibody that targets an aberrantly glycosylated antigen Mucin 1, and Imprime PGG, a glucan contained in yeast that is essential in triggering a leukocyte-mediated cytotoxic response towards tumor cells, in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced PDAC. The three intravenous drugs are taken in tandem 4 times in a 28-day cycle. The MAD of BTH1704 (BTH, 3 dose levels) in combination with gemcitabine (Gem) and Imprime PGG (I) will be determined using a standard "3+3" design. Treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, physician discretion, or patient refusal.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: BTH1704|DRUG: IMPRIME PGG|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The primary objective of this Phase 1b study is to determine the maximal administered dose (MAD) of BTH1704 (Mucin-1 targeted antibody) in combination with gemcitabine and Imprime PGG (beta 1,3/1,6 glucan) when given to patients with advanced and previously treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)., Up to 30 days post last dose
Adverse Effects, Characterize adverse effects (AE) of I-BTH-Gem in patients with advanced PDAC in the second and third line setting., Up to 30 days post final dose|Disease Response based on RECIST Criteria, Evaluate clinical response of I-BTH-Gem in patients with advanced PDAC in the second and third line setting (RECIST v 1.1)., Up to 8 weeks following final dose.
