This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. 40 patients will be enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety and efficacy
