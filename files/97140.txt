Study of Biomarker-Based Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This screening and multi-sub-study Phase 1b/2 trial will establish a method for genomic screening followed by assigning and accruing simultaneously to a multi-study "Master Protocol (BAML-16-001-M1)." The specific subtype of acute myeloid leukemia will determine which sub-study, within this protocol, a participant will be assigned to evaluate investigational therapies or combinations with the ultimate goal of advancing new targeted therapies for approval. The study also includes a marker negative sub-study which will include all screened patients not eligible for any of the biomarker-driven sub-studies.

Proportion of patients for whom molecular, immunophenotypic, and/or biochemical studies are completed in < 7 calendar days for assignment of treatment, The feasibility of completing molecular, genetic, immunophenotypic, and biochemical testing for assignment of therapy will be assessed based on the proportion of patients for whom testing is completed within 7 days of the registration sample arriving at the laboratory, 7 days|Proportion of patients assigned to a novel therapeutic treatment group in 1 of several sub-studies in this Master Protocol, based on the result of the molecular, immunophenotypic, and/or biochemical studies, The feasibility of assigning patients to a treatment group will be assessed based on the proportion who are eligible for screening in this study who are assigned to treatment either on this study or an industry study relevant to the specific marker group and not unassignable due to insufficient material, laboratory error, or any other factors, 7 days|Clinical response rate (rate of complete and partial responses) according to International Working Group criteria for treatment outcomes in therapeutic trials in acute myeloid leukemia, Up to 5 years

Assessment of clinical response will be made according to International Working Group criteria. Relationships will be explored graphically (eg, side-by-side boxplots or Kaplan-Meier plots), where estimates with confidence intervals will be presented as the primary method of analysis due to the limited number of patients., Up to 5 years
