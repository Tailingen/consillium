Topotecan in Treating Patients With Gynecologic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan in treating patients with gynecologic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
Cervical Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Sarcoma|Vaginal Cancer|Vulvar Cancer
DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride|OTHER: pharmacological study
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.|Safety and tolerability, Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.|Plasma concentration of topotecan hydrochloride when administered at the MTD, blood sample collection periodically on day 1 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies
Response, Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan hydrochloride in patients with unresectable gynecologic malignancies.
* To determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.
* To obtain pharmacokinetic data to assess plasma concentrations of this drug when administered at the MTD.

Secondary

* To explore the response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral topotecan hydrochloride on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose undergo blood sample collection periodically on day 1 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.
