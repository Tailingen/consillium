Study of Tumor Samples From Patients With Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor samples from patients with lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
c-Met expression, The correlation of c-Met expression and stage will be tested using Fisher's exact test. The proportions of c-Met overexpressed in stage I and stage II or higher will be estimated as well as the confidence intervals. The correlation of c-Met expression and survival will be tested using log rank test. The hazard ratio and its confidence interval will be estimated using a Cox model with a single predictor. Summary statistics will be provided for all c-Met measures., Baseline
EMT expression, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|Mutations in EGFR, Kras, p53, and c-CBL, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|c-CBL expression and LOH, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|DUB3 expression and regulation, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|ALK Translocation, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|Circulating c-Met and HGF in AC, The correlation of EMT, EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, and LOH, DUB3 expression, and ALK translocation, circulating c-Met and HGF with respect to survival will be evaluated by Cox model with these markers as continuous predictors or by log rank test with these biomarkers dichotomized at certain cutoff points, such as median or ad hoc optimal cutoff points., Baseline|Prognostic implications of circulating markers in AC of lung, Baseline|Levels of circulating Met and HGF in serum before and after surgery (when available), At time of surgery
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the correlation between c-Met expression, mutation and amplification, with stage and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung.

Secondary

* To determine the correlation with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression, mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), DUB3 expression \& regulation, and ALK translocation, with respect to survival.
* To determine the correlation with circulating c-Met and HGF in AC and evaluate prognostic implications of circulating markers in AC of lung.
* To determine (when available) levels of circulating Met and HGF in serum before and after surgery.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Previously collected tissue samples from patients enrolled in CALGB 140202 are assessed for mutation analysis of c-Met, EGFR, and K-ras. DNA is examined by PCR, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis; gene amplification of c-Met is examined by real time quantitative PCR; met/HF protein in serum is examined by ELISA; and c-Met, EGFR, p53, c-CBL, DUB3 enzyme, and ALK, and epithelial mesenchymal transition examined by IHC.
