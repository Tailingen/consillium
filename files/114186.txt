MicroRNAs and Prognosis in Breast Cancer
Mono-centric, observational retrospective and prospective study, designed for breast cancer patients to identify novel miRNA based biomarker able to predict metastases development in breast cancer patients.

Risk of metastases development, Identification of miRNAs associated with the risk to develop distant metastases., evaluation 5 and 10 years after diagnosis
Overall Survival, Identification of miRNAs associated with the risk of cancer specific death, evaluation 5 and 10 years after diagnosis
The potential role of miRNAs will be studied as a predictor of metastases development. miRNAs expression and miRNAs promoter methylation will be evaluated in surgically removed specimens obtained from breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Relevant miRNAs will be first identified by analysing a retrospective breast cancer cohort including at least and subsequently validated on a prospective cohort.
