A Study of Zilovertamab Vedotin (MK-2140/VLS-101) in Participants With Solid Tumors (MK-2140-002)
This is a study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of zilovertamab vedotin in participants with metastatic solid tumors including previously treated cancers of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-TNBC human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The study will evaluate a null hypothesis that the objective response rate (ORR) is ≤5% against the alternative hypothesis that it is ≥20%.
