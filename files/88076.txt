An Open-label, Uncontrolled Study of ONO-4578 and ONO-4538 in Combination With Standard-of-care Modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) or Gemcitabine Plus Nab-paclitaxel (GnP) Therapy as First-line Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This study is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study to investigate the tolerability and safety of ONO-4578, ONO-4538, and standard of care in combination as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
