A Phase IIa Study of the MEK Inhibitor Trametinib Monotherapy in the Treatment of Biliary Tract Cancers
This is a Phase IIa, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered MEK inhibitor trametinib as the second line in subjects with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTC) in Japanese population. The primary endpoint of this study is 12 week non-progressive disease (PD) rate defined as the percentage of subjects without progression at Week 12. As a sub-study, pharmacokinetics (PK) of four tablets of 0.5 milligram (mg) tablet, or one tablet of 2 mg tablet to achieve 2 mg daily regimen will be assessed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in Japanese population.

Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive trametinib at the recommended Phase II dose of 2 mg every day as one 2 mg tablet or four 0.5 mg tablets on Day 1. From Day 2 until disease progression or withdrawal from the study treatment, all subjects will receive one tablet of 2 mg trametinib . Disease assessment will be performed every 8 week. Translational research is also planned to evaluate the potential blood or tumor tissue-derived biomarkers for biological activity, and sensitivity or resistance to treatment with trametinib .
