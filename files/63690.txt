Secondary Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) in Patients With Relapsed Ovarian Cancer Who Have Progressed on PARP Inhibitor Maintenance
This is a randomized phase II study of secondary cytoreductive surgery (CRS) in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who have progressed on PARP inhibitor maintenance.
Ovarian Cancer|Drug Related Neoplasm/Cancer
PROCEDURE: secondary cytoreductive surgery|DRUG: chemotherapy
progression-free survival, interval between date of randomization and the date of second relapse/progression or death, whatever occurs first, Up to 2 year
Overall survival, from date of randomisation until death, Up to 2 year
30-day post-operative complications, MSKCC surgical complications grading method and CTCAE v4.03 criteria will be adopted for evaluating the perioperative complications, From the operation until after 30 days|Time to first subsequent anticancer therapy, From date of randomization until the date of first recurrent anticancer therapy, Up to 1 year|Time to second subsequent anticancer therapy, From date of randomization until the date of secondary recurrent anticancer therapy, Up to 2 year|Quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30,OV28, and EQ-5D-5L, baseline, 6 month and 1year after randomization
The primary objective is to find out whether the CRS is beneficial in patients who have progressed on PARPi maintenance.
