A Study of Selinexor in Combination With Standard of Care Therapy for Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Glioblastoma
This is a Phase 1/2 study of selinexor in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) or recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a Phase 1a dose finding study followed by Phase 1b (dose expansion) and a Phase 2 randomized efficacy exploration study and will independently evaluate 3 different combination regimens in 3 treatment arms in patients with nGBM (Arms A and B) or with rGBM (Arm C).

* Arm A: evaluating the combination of selinexor with radiation therapy (S-RT) in nGBM participants with uMGMT
* Arm B: evaluating the combination of selinexor with radiation therapy and temozolomide (TMZ) (S-TRT) in nGBM participants with methylated-O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (mMGMT)
* Arm C: evaluating the combination of selinexor with lomustine (or carmustine, if lomustine is not available) (S-L/C) in rGBM participants regardless of MGMT status
* Arm D: evaluating the combination of selinexor with bevacizumab in rGBM participants regardless of MGMT status
* Arm E: evaluating the combination of selinexor with tumor treating fields (TTField) in rGBM participants regardless of MGMT status

Phase 1a and 1b: Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined for participants as the duration from start of treatment to the date of PD, or death due to PD, whichever occurs first. PD per RANO response criteria: 1) At least two sequential scans separated by at \>=4 weeks both exhibiting \>=25 percent (%) increase in sum of products of perpendicular diameters or \>=40% increase in total volume of enhancing lesions. 2) In case where baseline or best response demonstrates no measurable enhancing disease, then any new measurable (\>10mm\*10mm) enhancing lesions considered PD after confirmed by a subsequent scan \>=4 weeks exhibiting \>=25% increase in sum of products of perpendicular diameters or \>=40% increase in total volume of enhancing lesions relative to scan first illustrating new measurable disease. 3) Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from tumor or attributable to changes in steroid dose. 4) Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition., From first dose study treatment until progression or death due to progression (Up to 15.41 months)|Phase 1a and 1b: Progressive Free Survival (PFS), Progression defined as first occurrence of PD per modified RANO including both radiological PD and clinical deterioration.
