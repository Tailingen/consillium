Dermatoscopy Guided Resection for Skin Cancer
In this randomizid controlled trial the aim is to use dermatoscopy in deciding the resection margin for patients with suspected or verified basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The outcome is radical/non radical resection of the lateral margins in the pathology report.
Basal Cell Carcinoma|Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Surgical Margin
DEVICE: Dermatoscopy
Pathology resection side margin (radical/not radical), If the side margins in the pathology report is radical or not, Pathology report usually within two weeks after surgery
In basal cell carcinoma and especially cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma the prognosis is very good if the tumour is radically removed in the primary resection. In this study we propose that the use of dermatoscopy in deciding the surgical margins can increase the proportion of radically removed tumours. In this randomized clinical trial the use of dermatoscopy in deciding the surgical margins in patients with suspected or verified basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is assessed. The outcome measure is radical/non radical resection of the lateral margins. In the control group dematoscopy is not used in deciding the surgical margin. 400 patients with suspected or verified BCC or cSCC will be included, 200 in each group.
