Study of Zevalin Versus Observation in Participants at Least 60 Years Old With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma in Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Negative Complete Remission After Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zevalin compared with observation alone in participants who are in PET-negative complete remission after first-line R-CHOP or R-CHOP like therapy.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma|Follicle Center Lymphoma
DRUG: Zevalin|DRUG: Y-90-Zevalin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: In-111 Zevalin
Overall Survival (OS) for Living Participants, OS was the time from randomization to death. In living participants, survival time was censored on the last date that participants were known to be alive. OS for living participant was calculated as (end of study date/last visit date - randomization date)+ 1/30.4375. Overall Survival was summarized separately for living participants as only few participants died in this study., From randomization till death or end of study, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 2.5 years)|Overall Survival for Death, OS was the time from randomization to death. OS for death calculated as (date of death - randomization date)+ 1/30.4375. Overall Survival was summarized separately for participants who were died as only few participants died in this study., From randomization till death or end of study, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 2.5 years)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of relapse or death from any cause., From randomization till death or end of study, whichever occurs first (Up to approximately 2.5 years)|Overall Survival Rate at 24 Months, The OS rate at 24-month defined as the percentage of all randomized participants who died within 24 months of randomization., 24 Months
