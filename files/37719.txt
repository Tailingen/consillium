Pilot Study to Evaluate the Prevention and Safety of Doxorubicin-induced Cardiomyopathy Using Extracorporeal Shock Waves
Until now, patients receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy should use only the cumulative dose related to known cardiotoxicity, or if cardiotoxicity occurs below the known cumulative dose, use of doxorubicin as chemotherapy should be stopped. In this study, in patients with normal heart function receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy was performed 3 times a week during chemotherapy, and 1 cycle of extracorporeal shock wave therapy was performed (every 6 weeks) every 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Echocardiography should be performed at baseline and every 4 cycles of chemotherapy, and follow-up 3 months after chemotherapy is completed to compare the incidence of cardiomyopathy caused by chemotherapy between the two groups.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Extracorporeal shock waves
Chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy, Primary efficacy endpoint: Cardiomyopathy is defined as the LV longitudinal strain value, an echocardiographic index, and the incidence rate of cardiomyopathy between the experimental group and the control group is compared. The definition of cardiomyopathy in LV longitudinal strain is as follows

- When the strain value of the longitudinal axis of the left ventricle (LV global longitudinal strain) decreases to less than -17.5% or reduction of \>15% compared to the baseline value., 3months, 6months
Chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy 2, Secondary efficacy endpoint: To compare the rate of cardiomyopathy between the experimental group and the control group in breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy with baseline normal heart function. The definition of cardiomyopathy is as follows.

* A decrease of more than 10% in absolute left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or
* A decrease of less than 50% from the normal range of left ventricular ejection fraction (\>55%), 3months, 6months
1. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy cycle

   * For breast cancer patients using doxorubicin as the main anticancer agent, 1 cycle of extracorporeal shock wave therapy was performed every 2 cycles of chemotherapy.
   * The extracorporeal shock wave therapy is targeted to the existing refractory angina pectoris patients and is based on the energy used in patients with ischemic heart disease without serious side effects. The treatment is performed 3 times a week in 1 cycle, 200 shots per spot. , a shock wave of 0.09mJ/mm2 energy was applied to 40-60 spots (8,19,20)
   * Conventional chemotherapy is performed every 3 weeks, and the dose of doxorubicin used per session is 40-60 mg/m2, and considering the cumulative dose, chemotherapy is performed on average 6-8 times. Therefore, extracorporeal shock wave therapy is performed every 6 weeks, and a total of 3 to 4 times.
   * It is expected that factors affecting efficacy will be controlled by targeting patients with the same carcinoma, the same chemotherapy, and no underlying heart disease. Since the cumulative doxorubicin dose can be received from a minimum of 60mg/m2 to a maximum of 400mg/m2, the cumulative dose of doxorubicin in the control and experimental groups should be divided into sections to further analyze the cardiomyopathy incidence rate and echocardiographic indicators.
   * Extracorporeal shock wave therapy position and posture The extracorporeal shock wave probe is placed at the position where the apical view of the echocardiogram is taken, and the patient's posture is supine or lateral position. When extracorporeal shock wave therapy is performed in the following locations, the entire cardiac muscle can be included.
2. It was assumed that the incidence of cardiomyopathy in patients receiving extracorporeal shock wave therapy was low. Cardiomyopathy is defined as ① a decrease in the absolute value of left ventricular ejection fraction by 10% or more or ② a decrease in the absolute value of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) by 8% or more. In this study, cardiomyopathy caused by the definition of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was set as the primary efficacy evaluation.

   Therefore, when the target number of subjects is set according to the definition that the LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) set as the primary efficacy evaluation variable is reduced to less than 17.5%, the absolute LVGLS value is the dependent variable, the significance level is 0.05, and the power is based on 85%. Therefore, when the ratio between groups is 1:1, the mean of the treated group is expected to be 19.6%, the mean of the untreated group is expected to be 18.0%, and when the standard deviations are applied as 2.4% and 2.4%, respectively, when using the G\*Power 3.1 program, 33 people are required for each calculated group. Considering the dropout rate of 10%, 36 people each, a total of 72 subjects, is calculated as the required number of subjects.
