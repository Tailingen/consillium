A Study of MHB036C for Advanced Solid Tumor
Phase I/II, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MHB036C in advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: MHB036C
Incidence of participants with adverse events (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Until 30 days after last dose of MHB036C|Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities related to MHB036C which meet pre-defined severity criteria and occurs within the first cycle of treatment, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To analysis the serum concentrations at different timepoints to determine the Cmax, Until 30 days after last dose of MHB036C|The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), To analysis the serum concentrations at different timepoints to determine the AUC, Until 30 days after last dose of MHB036C|To detectable anti-drug antibodies with treated subjects, The immunogenicity of MHB036C will be assessed by the number of subjects who produce anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Until 30 days after last dose of MHB036C|Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), based on RECIST Version 1.1., Until 30 days after last dose of MHB036C
This first-in-human, dose escalation and dose expansion study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of MHB036C in patients with advanced solid tumor. The Phase I stage is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The phase II stage is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) according to safety and efficacy in specific tumor types.
