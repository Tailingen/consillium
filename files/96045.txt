A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of NKTR-214 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors
In this four-part study, NKTR-214 was administered in combination with nivolumab and with/without other anticancer therapies. Part 1 considered escalating doublet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab) doses to determine the RP2D. Part 2 considered dose expansion cohorts for the doublet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab ± chemotherapy). Part 3 was schedule-finding for a triplet therapy (NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab). Part 4 dose expansion for the triplet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab) was planned to further assess the efficacy of the RP2D triplet combination at dosing schedules from Part 3.

Part 1 Dose Escalation: Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) During the DLT Evaluation Window, Part 1of the study was a dose-escalation phase that evaluated the safety and tolerability and defined the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose of the NKTR-214/nivolumab doublet across 5 dosage/schedule levels. The results presented are for the DLT Population., Includes DLTs that occurred within the DLT window of at least 21 days after the first dose of study treatment (28 days for every 2 weeks dosing; 21 days for every 3 weeks dosing). Patients were counted only once under each preferred term.|Part 3 Schedule Finding: Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) During the DLT Evaluation Window, Part 3 of the study was a schedule finding phase to establish the recommended phase 2 dosing schedules for Part 4 and assess the safety and tolerability for the NKTR-214/nivolumab/ipilimumab triplet combination. The results presented are for the DLT Population., Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during a 3-week (21-day) DLT evaluation period beginning with the first dose of ipilimumab.|Part 2 and Part 4: Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 at Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) at Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

ORR is defined as the percentage of enrolled participants who achieved a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR is calculated as the sum of CR and PR., Tumor assessment at Screening then every 8 weeks (± 7 days) from Cycle 1 Day 1 and end of treatment (unless scan done within 4 weeks) up to approximately 27 months.
Part 1 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NKTR 214 + nivolumab doublet therapy.

Part 2 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies (including 9 tumor types consisting of the same 5 tumor types as in Part 1, plus hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \[HER 2\] negative breast cancer \[HR+ HER2- BC\], gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer \[SCLC\]) to assess the efficacy of the RP2D.

Part 3 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, or urothelial carcinoma (UCC) in a first-line setting (1L) to assess the safety and tolerability of NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab triplet therapy Three dosing schedules were evaluated to establish RP2D dosing schedules for Part 4 of the study.

Part 4 planned to enroll patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, or UCC to further assess the efficacy of the RP2D triplet combination at the 3 dosing schedules from Part 3. Patients were enrolled simultaneously to each tumor cohort.

All patients enrolled in the study were closely monitored for safety, tolerability and response per RECIST criteria. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1 at the RP2D doublet.
