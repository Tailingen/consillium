Brain Irradiation for Childhood Cancer - Endocrine Monitoring During the First Years
BICHE- 1: Brain Irradiation for Childhood cancer - Endocrine monitoring during the first five years is a study of endocrine monitoring after cerebral radiotherapy.

The study concerns patients in remission at the end of oncological treatment aged between 4 and 18 years at the time of inclusion and who have had radiotherapy before the age of 16, irradiating all or part of the brain, with a delay between the end of radiotherapy and inclusion of less than 5 years. Patients will be included during a routine visit to the paediatric endocrinologist.

The protocol for the Biche 1 study has been designed and discussed in a multidisciplinary and multicentre manner, based on data from the literature and the French reference document (September 2021) "National protocol for diagnosis and care - congenital pituitary deficiency".

In this population, the investigators will conduct a descriptive and exploratory study to establish recommendations for medium-term follow-up; to improve screening for endocrine deficiencies affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in order to improve patients' quality of life and state of health; and to better define dose-volume constraints on the axis.

The study will also focus on better detection and characterisation of chronic fatigue as a potential sequela of pituitary deficiencies, in particular by means of a questionnaire assessing fatigue (PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue scale) which will also be systematically administered and completed annually.The expected sample size is 100-150 patients treated for a brain tumour and 60-80 patients treated for another tumour but with an irradiation field covering all or part of the brain.

RADIATION: Blood sample, urine sample, osteodensitometry
Endocrine toxicities assessment after radiotherapy involving all or part of the brain in children, adolescents and young adults treated for cancer before the age of 16 (â‰¤15 years), Measurement of hormon level for :

* growth hormone deficiency
* gonadal insufficiency
* hypothyroidism
* adrenal insufficiency, Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy
To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Dose absorbed (Gy) by sensitive organs: This parameter corresponds to the total amount of radiation absorbed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, two key structures of the endocrine axis. A cumulative dose above certain thresholds is associated with a higher risk of long-term endocrine dysfunction - possibly after adjustment for the biological equivalent dose (which also takes fractionation into account)., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Maximum dose (Dmax): The maximum dose received by a small portion of tissue in these critical organs., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Volume irradiated (%): This parameter measures the proportion of the organ exposed to radiotherapy., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Average dose (Dmean) and D50%: The average and median dose received by the whole organ., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Minimum dose (Dmin): minimum dose received by the organ., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|To define risk factors for anterior pituitary insufficiency in patients who received brain radiotherapy, taking into account treatment characteristics and clinical data., Dose-volume histogram (DVH): The DVH analysis enables you to visualize the dose distribution over the entire organ, and to identify any thresholds other than those listed above., Follow-up of 4 years, within a maximum of 5 years post-radiotherapy|Hormone deficiencies on fatigue in adult patients, Measurement by a questionnaire assessing fatigue (PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue scale) composed of 18 items comprising 3 dimensions.
