Lidocaine Mucilage-ICG as an Optical Agent for Tumor Delineation During Breast-conserving Surgery
Around 15%-30% of patients receiving breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for invasive breast carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) need a reoperation due to tumor-positive margins at final histopathology. Currently available modalities used for intraoperative surgical margin assessment all have specific limitations. In order to improve intraoperative tumor localization and surgical margin assessment in BCS, we developed a fluorescent tracer, the Lidocaine mucilage-ICG tracer, which could be locally injected and detected by fluorescent camera systems during operation. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of Lidocaine mucilage-ICG as an agent for intraoperative tumor delineation.
