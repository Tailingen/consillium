Improve the Treatment of Thoracic Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is

1. To compare the effects of the two types of thoracic esophageal cancer lymphadenectomy on the staging and prognosis of resectable esophageal cancer, which defined by the International Association of esophageal disease(ISDE) - standard mediastinal lymphadenectomy,total mediastinal lymphadenectomy and three field lymphadenectomy,and to find out reasonable range of lymphadenectomy.
2. To compare the effects of Chemotherapy Group (Docetaxel + Nedaplatin) with Control Group on the prognosis of resectable thoracic esophageal cancer,and to explore the indications of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: adjuvant chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: standard two field Lymphadenectomy|PROCEDURE: Total two field Lymphadenectomy|PROCEDURE: three field Lymphadenectomy
survival rate, 1. Disease-free survival
2. overall survival, 5 years
According to different location of the primary lesionï¼Œthe subject can be allocated to two sub-groups:

The patient with upper or middle thoracic esophageal cancer may be assigned to two field(T)-total mediastinal lymphadenectomy group,which is control group in this study or three field lymphadenectomy-Abdominal + mediastinal + cervical lymphadenectomy group,which is study group in this study randomly.

After the operation,the patient whose primary lesion is completely(R0) resected will be assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy group or interview group randomly.
