Feasibility and Safety of a Wireless Palpator
Evaluation of the ability of the Palpator to detect hidden (occult) lung tumours that cannot be visualized or palpated using the traditional methods of visual inspection, grasper palpation, and VATS ultrasound.
Lung Cancer|Thoracic Neoplasm
DEVICE: Palpator|DEVICE: Grasper|DEVICE: Ultrasound|OTHER: Finger palpation
Tumour detection, The palpator will be declared feasible of it can detect at least 80% of tumours (sensitivity) without the need for a thoracotomy., 1 day
Prevention of thoracotomy, The number of patients undergoing conversion from VATS to open thoracotomy, 1 day|Adverse events, Adverse events will be recorded., 30 days
All procedures will be performed with the patient under general anesthesia with single lung ventilation through double-lumen endotracheal intubation. Three to four thoracoports, no larger than 12 mm, will be inserted in the intercostal spaces as needed. After VATS port placement, the pleural cavity will be insufflated with CO2 to a maximum pressure of 8 mm Hg to assist with lung deflation. A standard VATS pleuroscopy will be performed to visually search for the nodule and its position confirmed with sequential assessment using a grasper, the Palpator, the VATS ultrasound probe, and then finger palpation. This will ensure that all patients will have the opportunity to avoid a large thoracotomy if the lesion can't be identified by the Palpator. If the lesion can be detected either visually or by grasper palpation, this information will be recorded, but will be excluded from the analysis of Palpator feasibility.
