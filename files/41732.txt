Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Kidney Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or has come back (recurrent). Stereotactic radiosurgery, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Number of Participants With Radiation Therapy (RT)-Related Grade >= 4 Toxicity, RT-related grade \>= 4 toxicity will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the study group, taking into consideration the region treated with SBRT, timing of the toxicity, and the nature of the toxicity. Rates of RT-related grade \>= 4 toxicity will be recorded, time to RT-related grade \>= 4 toxicity will be recorded, and freedom from RT-related grade \>= 4 toxicity will be determined using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 1 year
Treated Lesion Control (LeC), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From the start of treatment to the time of local progression at each treated lesion, assessed up to 1 year|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as defined as progression in the treated lesion, organ in which the treated lesion is present, distant failure, or death from any cause any new sites of disease on imaging or any progressive disease by RECIST criteria at initially treated sites of disease (within 80% isodose line). PFS will be estimated using descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier method., From start of treatment to time of progression, assessed up to 1 year|Toxicity Profile of 5-fraction SBRT Based on Normal Tissue Dosimetric Constraints Based on the Organ Site of Involvement, Toxicities of interest that occur within the 3-12 month time frame after RT start will be documented and analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 1 year
