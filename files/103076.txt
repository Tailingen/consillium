A Pharmacokinetic Study of AMG 386 in Cancer Subjects With Normal and Impaired Renal Function
This is a phase 1, open-label pharmacokinetic study where up to 40 subjects with advanced solid tumors (up to 6-10 with normal renal function and up to 18-30 with varying degrees of renal dysfunction) will receive weekly doses of AMG 386 intravenously. The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single agent AMG 386 in subjects with various degrees of renal function. Once the AMG 386 PK characterization is complete in the first 5 weeks of the study, all subjects will be allowed to continue to receive AMG 386 weekly only or subjects in group 1, 2 or 3 can opt to receive AMG 386 weekly in combination with paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Kidney Disease|Renal Impairment
DRUG: AMG 386 + Paclitaxel|DRUG: AMG 386
Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), Week 1-5.|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Week 1-5.|Time to maximum concentration (tmax), Week 1-5.|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin), Week 1-5.|Clearance (CL) of AMG 386 calculated as dose divided by AUC on week 5., Week 1-5
Adverse events as a measure of safety, Weekly at each visit AMG 386 is administered, on day 30, 31 and 32 when only PK assessments are scheduled up to and including the last study visit 30 days after the last AMG 386 administration.|Changes in vital signs as a measure of safety, Weekly at each visit AMG 386 is administered up to and including the last study visit 30 days after the last AMG 386 administration.|Changes in clinical laboratory tests as a measure of safety, Weekly from week 1-9 then every 4 weeks thereafter including the last study visit 30 days after the last AMG 386 administration.|Anti-AMG 386 antibody formation, Week 1, week 5, week 9 and every 16 weeks thereafter including the last study visit 30 days after the last AMG 386 administration.|Tumor objective response measured by CT or MRI (without Gadolinium contrast agents) and assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Week 5 and every 8 weeks thereafter until the subject's end of participation in the study.
