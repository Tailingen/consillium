Personalized Cancer Stem Cell High-Throughput Drug Screening for Glioblastoma
Proposed treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with novel personalized drug regimens identified to be effective in vitro using cancer stem cells derived from their individual tumors, alongside standard of care radiation and TMZ.
Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
DRUG: combinations of up to 3 FDA approved drugs from a panel of compounds
determine safety of CSC/HTS-based combination drug therapy, incidence of treatment-related AEs, laboratory abnormalities, and SAEs as assessed by CTCAE version 5.0, From date of first dose of investigational drug regimen until date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
Efficacy of CSC/HTS-based combination drug therapy, Response assessment per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, From inclusion in the study up to approximately 36 months|Efficacy of CSC/HTS-based combination drug therapy, Progression-free survival (PFS), From inclusion in the study until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 36 months|Efficacy of CSC/HTS-based combination drug therapy, Median overall survival (OS), From inclusion in the study until date of death from any cause, assessed up to approximately 36 months
A panel of FDA approved drugs will be tested by high throughput screening, which is CLIA certified allowing for clinical decisions based on the results, to identify a combination of up to 3 drug candidates for treating individual patients. Lead candidates will be evaluated by pharmacists and a team of physicians, to confirm that prescribed drugs do not utilize pharmacological/ metabolic pathways that are known to increase the likelihood of toxicity, prior to initiating treatment. Investigational drug therapy, targeting CSCs, will be initiated alongside standard of care chemoradiation with TMZ.
