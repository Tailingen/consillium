Study With TMX-101 in Patients With Carcinoma In Situ (CIS) Bladder Cancer
This is a Phase II pilot study to explore the effect of intravesical TMX-101 in patients with CIS bladder cancer, as assessed by histology and cytology after TMX-101 treatment.
Carcinoma in Situ|Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: TMX-101
To assess the activity of TMX-101, as determined by the number of patients who experience complete response (CR)., 5 to 7 weeks after the last TMX -101 instillation
Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study., Patients will be followed through treatment and follow-up, for an expected total period of up to 13 weeks.
This study is an open label, pilot study of TMX-101 in the treatment of carcinoma in situ. TMX-101 is a new formulation of Imiquimod optimized for intravesical delivery. Imiquimod possesses immune-stimulatory properties. TMX-101 is being developed as a potential treatment for patients with non-invasive bladder cancer, including patients with CIS bladder cancer.

Following confirmation of CIS by histology, patients will receive weekly instillations of TMX-101 for 6 weeks. Five to seven weeks after the last instillation, biopsies and cytology will be performed. Response to treatment will be determined based on cytology and tissue sample histology findings.
