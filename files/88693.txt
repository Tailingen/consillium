PROACT - Pre-Operative Arimidex Compared To Tamoxifen
The purpose of this study is to compare tamoxifen, versus a newer treatment, ARIMIDEX, which we already know to be well tolerated. The main objectives of this research study are to see whether using these drugs will shrink down tumours before surgery and to see if any shrinkage in the tumour affects the extent of surgery that is required.
