Community-Driven Cervical Cancer Prevention in Western Kenya
There are many challenges to implementation of cervical cancer prevention in resource-limited countries, despite evidence based screening and treatment strategies. The investigators hypothesize that self-collected HPV specimens offered in a community health campaign setting will

BEHAVIORAL: Community-based testing with standard linkage to care|BEHAVIORAL: Community-based HPV testing with enhanced linkage to care
Reach of cervical cancer screening using self-collected HPV specimens in community health campaigns compared to clinics, The investigators will compare the number of women who uptake HPV testing in the community health campaign arms compared to the number who uptake HPV testing in the clinic-based arms., 2 years
Determine the Efficacy of the cervical cancer prevention program, The investigators will compare the number of women accessing treatment for positive HPV results with standard linkage to care compared to the enhanced linkage to treatment strategy., 4 years
Determine the cost-effectiveness, The investigators will determine the cost-effectiveness of the three strategies in this study: clinic-based testing with standard referral to care, community-health campaign testing w/ standard referral to care \& community based testing w/ enhanced linkage to care., 4-5 years
