Biomarker Development for Response Prediction by DNA Mutational Analysis
The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is possible to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer who are treated with irinotecan by determining the mutational profile of the tumor.
Neoplasm Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood samples|PROCEDURE: Pharmacokinetics|PROCEDURE: Midazolam clearance test
Exploration of the correlation between the mutational profile and the percentage change in volumetric measurement of the index lesion after the first two cycles of chemotherapy., Change in radiological volume of the index lesion after the first 2 cycles of irinotecan. Radiological response (according to RECIST 1.1) after the first 2 cycles of irinotecan (i.e. after 2 x 3 weeks = 6 weeks)
Exploration of the correlation between the mutational profile and radiological response according to RECIST-criteria after the first two cycles of chemotherapy., Analysis 6 weeks after initiation of treatment|Exploration of the correlation between the mutational profile and progression free survival and overall survival., Overall survival approximately after 2 years of first cycle of irinotecan. Progression free survival approximately 3 months after first irinotecan|Exploration of the correlation between the mutational profile of the index lesion and patient's germline DNA background variation., Analysis after progressive disease, on average after 3 months.|Differences in mutational profile of metastasis prior to and after exposure to treatment., Analysis after progressive disease and subsequent post-treatment biopsy, on average after 3 months of treatment|Determine reliable and valid strategies for statistical analysis for biomarker discovery, 2 years|Correlate response to pharmacokinetics of SN-38, After progressive disease and subsequent post-treatment biopsy, in general after 3 months of treatment|Determine carboxylesterase activity in metastatic tumor material (pre- and posttreatment) and correlate intra-tumoral carboxylesterase activity to systemic SN-38 pharmacokinetics and to irinotecan response, After progressive disease and subsequent post-treatment biopsy, in general after 3 months of treatment|Determine clinical applicability of the midazolam phenotyping probe, After first cycle of irinotecan, at three weeks|Number and nature of all (serious) adverse events of study related procedures, 14 days after baseline biopsy and 14 days after post-treatment biopsy (approximately after 3 months of treatment)
