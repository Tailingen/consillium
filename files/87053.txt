Comparing Two Techniques of Haemostasis After Cervical Conization
The LEEP conization is commonly used for cervical pathologies treatment. The techniques for hemostasis usually used are: cautery, Monsel's solution and vaginal pack. Actually, there is no consensus about the best technique and there is not much information that validates the use of some of that. To compare the use or not of vaginal pack as methods of hemostasis after LEEP conization for management of cervical lesions.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Cervix Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Vaginal Packing
Vaginal bleeding until 30 days after surgery, Bleeding was assessed by the need for reintervention., Until 30 days after surgery
A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Gynecology Oncology Department/Barretos Cancer Hospital for patients with indication of LEEP conization. After local IRB approval, patients were allocated in two arms (50 patients each): without vaginal pack (group 1 - GP1) and with vaginal pack (group 2 - GP2). The Monsel's solution was used in all patients. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes will be evaluated: operative time, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, hormonal status, age, parity and cone specimens' characteristics as well as short-term outcome were recorded and compared using Chi-square test, Fisher exact test and t-test where appropriate.
