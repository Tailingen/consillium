Establishment of Precision Targeted Therapy Strategies for Advanced Gastric Cancer Based on Novel Molecular Subtyping
This study is a prospective, umbrella-design, Phase II clinical trial. Eligible participants with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who are treatment-naïve for advanced-stage systemic therapy will undergo biomarker profiling (HER2, CLDN18.2, and PD-L1) via next-generation sequencing (NGS) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Participants will be stratified into distinct molecular subtypes and assigned subtype-specific therapeutic regimens. The primary objectives are to assess treatment efficacy (e.g., objective response rate) and safety profiles across molecularly defined cohorts.

ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to a therapeutic intervention, as assessed by standardized criteria (e.g., RECIST 1.1 for solid tumors). It serves as a key efficacy endpoint in early-phase clinical trials to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of investigational therapies., 2year
OS, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or initiation of treatment) until death from any cause. It is considered the gold standard endpoint in oncology clinical trials due to its objectivity and direct relevance to patient benefit., 2year
