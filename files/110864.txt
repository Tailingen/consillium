Usability, Adherence and Diagnostic Performance of PointCheck in Pediatric Population
Single-site non-significant risk, open-label clinical investigation designed to validate the usability, adherence, and preliminary diagnostic performance of a novel technology to detect neutropenia. Study participants will be managed as per the standard of care practice with a baseline and nadir visit including laboratory determinations. Participants will also be evaluated with the device at both time points and with daily measurements during the two-week period in between.
Hematologic Malignancy
DEVICE: PointCheck
Usability of PointCheck, The study will confirm if participants can acquire good quality videos in a home like setting.

The System Usability Scale (0-100 higher scored indicate a better usability) will be completed by the participants after completing the follow up visit., Up to three-weeks
Accuracy of PointCheck, The preliminary diagnostic accuracy to detect grade IV neutropenia according to CTCAE V5 (\<500 ANC/mm3) measured by the sensitivity and the specificity will be the evaluated with reference to the corresponding laboratory measures acquired at the nadir (follow up) visit., Up to three-weeks|Repeatability of PointCheck, The % agreement of the device to classify neutropenia compared to the laboratory reference will be established, Up to three-weeks|Number of participants with device-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The number (and %) of AEs, SAEs and their relationship with the device use will be the safety endpoint, Up to three-weeks|Adherence to PointCheck, The number of days that the participant used the device will be used to evaluate adherence., Up to three-weeks
Predictive capacity of PointCheck, An exploratory analysis about the number of days before the second lab determination that PointCheckTM detected severe neutropenia will be investigated in those participants with severe neutropenia at the nadir visit. Also, exploratory analysis will be conducted in patients developing febrile neutropenia (axillary temperature ≥100.4°F and grade III/IV neutropenia documented in the lab report) during the study to evaluate how many days before the appearance of fever the device detected severe neutropenia during the at home phase of the study., Up to three-weeks|Diagnostic performance for a second cutoff, The preliminary diagnostic accuracy to detect grade III neutropenia according to CTCAE V5 (\<1000 ANC/mm3) 13 measured by the sensitivity and the specificity will be the evaluated with reference to the corresponding laboratory measures acquired at the nadir (follow up) visit., Up to three-weeks|Clinical Utility Assessment, Survey completed by the clinical team at the baseline visit assessing the clinical utility of PointCheckTM, Up to three-weeks
Single-site non-significant risk, open-label clinical investigation designed to validate the usability, adherence, and preliminary diagnostic performance of a novel technology to detect neutropenia. Study participants will be managed as per the standard of care practice with a baseline and nadir visit including laboratory determinations.
