Retroprospective Real Life Observatory of Eribulin
The objective of this observatory is to evaluate the effecacy of Eribulin in patients with metastatic breast cancer on a recent prescription period.

Part of the data collection will be retrospective and the other part will be prospective for patients started treatment by Eribulin between November 2014 and September 2015. It will allow a better assessment on the safety profile of this drug.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
OTHER: Eribulin (ReProLine)
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time between the first administration of Eribulin and death from any cause., 1 year
Overall Survival by subgroup, Overall survival is defined as the time between the first administration of Eribulin and death from any cause in the following subgroups:

* According to the administration line of Eribulin: administration in third line or more versus administration in first or second line or for locally advanced cancer,
* in HER2 + population
* in triple negative population
* in the elderly (\> 70 years)
* in the overweight population (BMI\> 30), 1 year|Progression free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time between the first administration of Eribulin and the first demonstrated progression by image, 1 year|Treatment response rate, Treatment response rate will be assessed by:

* the best response obtained between the first administration of treatment with Eribulin and demonstrated progression by image (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) or clinical
* the clinical benefit (number of complete responses, partial responses or persistent stabilities mare than 6 months)., 1 year|Treatment's tolerance, The treatment's tolerance will be assessed by collecting adverse events â‰¥ grade 3 quoted according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 classification., 1 year
Approximately one third of patients treated for localized breast cancer will present a metastatic evolution and 5% of patients are metastatic immediately.

At this stage, the malignancy is incurable with a median survival from 2 to 3 years.

Metastatic breast cancer treatment is part of a multidisciplinary approach. These two objectives are to prolong survival and improve quality of life. At present, there is no standard after the first line of chemotherapy, with fe strategy studies Eribulin is now a new therapeutic option to consider. Many patients have benefited from this treatment option and it seems interesting to evaluate in real life the effecacy and tolerance of chemotherapy.
