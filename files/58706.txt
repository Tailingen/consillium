PET-CT Predicting Segement Specific Lymph Nodes Metastasis
This study is a multicenter prospective clinical study that aims to evaluate the predictive value of preoperative PET-CT results (such as SUV uptake, size of tumor lymph nodes, and differences in FDG uptake compared to surrounding tissues) for lymph node metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. During surgery, all patients underwent systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection. The final pathological results were used to assess the predictive value of PET-CT for segment-specific lymph node metastasis.
