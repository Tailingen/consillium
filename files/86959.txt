CPX-351 Salvage Therapy Followed by Haplo-Cord Transplant for Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This pilot study is designed to evaluate outcomes with the combination of CPX-351 salvage therapy and haplo-cord graft stem cell transplantation for subjects with relapsed or refractory AML or myelodysplastic syndrome.
