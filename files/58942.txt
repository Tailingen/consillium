Comparison of HD Chemotherapy Followed by Auto-transplant and R-CHOP in High Risk Patients With DLBCL.
Multicentric randomized phase III study comparing high doses of chemotherapy with Rituximab followed by auto-transplant HPC versus CHOP plus Rituximab as first line therapy in high risk patients with DLBCL Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab-HDS|DRUG: Rituximab-CHOP
Event Free Survival, EFS was defined from the time of the study entry to any treatment failure including disease progression or discontinuation of treatment for any reason or date of the last follow-up visit, 36 months from end of therapy
Complete Remission, Clinical response was assessed by complete restaging according to Cheson criteria. Cheson BD, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, et al: Revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma.

Diffuse large B cells Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas represents one of the most frequent form of lymphoma. Its clinical development progresses rapidly and is characterized by a biphasic survival curve with patients in complete remission (which can be considered cured) and patients that relapse. This last group of subjects have only 25%-33% chance of long free disease survival if treated with a second line therapy with high dose chemotherapy plus autologous transplant of PBPC.

Therefore in order to achieve an improvement of the overall survival in patient with DLBCL, it is necessary to increase the number of complete remission after first line therapy.

The aim of R-HDS study, multicentre randomized phase III trial, is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of an intensive conditioning regimen with high intensity chemo-immunotherapy (R-HDS) plus autologous transplantation versus CHOP conditioning regimen plus Rituximab in patients with unfavorable prognosis at diagnosis.
