Acupuncture With Press Tack Needles for Perioperative Pain After Open Radical Prostatectomy
Acupuncture has been shown in several meta-analyses and clinical studies, in different surgical settings and chronic back pain, to be a safe adjuvant option for postoperative pain treatment. In this study, the investigator hypothesize that acupuncture can decrease postoperative pain intensity and amount of given analgesics, and accelerate recovery of bowel motility, in patients after open radical prostatectomy.

The investigator will also investigate whether or not acupuncture with needle skin penetration is more efficacious than acupressure.
