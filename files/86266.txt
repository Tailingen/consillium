Study of the Depth of Anesthesia on Postoperative Clinical Outcome in Patients With Supratentorial Tumor
Recent studies have shown that deep anesthesia is associated with poor outcome. There is still lack of randomized controlled trials with large sample size on the effect of depth of anesthesia on the postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing brain tumor resection. The investigators are performing a randomized and parallel group trial. The aim of the study is to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the depth of anesthesia and postoperative clinical outcome in patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery.
