A Study of Extended Total Mesopancreas Excision(eTME) for Pancreatic Head Adenocarcinoma.
The study of extended total mesopancreas excision(eTME) for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma is a retrospective multicenter cohort, collecting medical records and follow-up data of patients who underwent radical resection with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
Overall survival, The overall survival data were defined by (date of death)-(date of first diagnosis).The survival status of patients were retrieved from follow-up., 5 years
Disease free survival, The overall survival data were defined by (date of recurrence/progression)-(date of surgery).During follow-up period, abdominal enhanced CT, chest X-ray, tumor markers and routine blood tests were carried out to evaluate recurrence/progression., 5 years
The objectives of the study are as follows:

1. To evaluate the perioperative safety of extended total mesopancreas excision(eTME) for patients who diagnosed with resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
2. To demonstrate the prognosis of extended total mesopancreas excision(eTME) for patients who diagnosed with resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
