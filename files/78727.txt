Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of BAT8006 for Injection
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8006 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors, explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and provide the recommended dose for subsequent clinical trials.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: BAT8006 for Injection
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT refers to any grade 3 or higher toxicities associated with the test drug that occurred within 21 days of the subject's initial administration, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as exploration in a dose group observed ≤1/6 of subjects during the DLT evaluation period to the highest dose level of DLT., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
Pharmacokinetics（PK）, Cmax, The first 6 treatment cycles(each cycle is 21 days)
In this multi-center, open, dose-increasing, dose-expanding Phase I clinical study, rapid titration and a "3+3" dose-increasing design were used to explore the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of BAT8006 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. During the dose-escalation test, appropriate doses were selected for the extended study according to the previous study data.
