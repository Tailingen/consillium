Advanced MRI Applications Development
The goals of this study are to:

1. To improve upon and develop new innovative magnetic resonance imaging techniques that refine image quality and enhance performance. Improvements in these areas will have positive implications for medical diagnosis and treatment.
2. To correlate MRI images with underlying disease pathophysiology in order to ensure that imaging accurately reflects the disease process.
