Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Sequential Immunotherapy for Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of sequential immunotherapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: tislelizumab|RADIATION: radiotherapy
Complete pathological response rate, 1 year
R0 resection rate, 1 year|2-year Disease-free survival rate, 2 years|2-year overall survival rate, 2 years|Safety will be analyzed through the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, Up to 28 days from last dose
This is a single-arm, phase Ib study. Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed ESCC and clinical T3-4aN0M0 or T2-4aN+M0 (AJCC/UICC 8). Patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy (41.4Gy in 23 fractions) with concurrent chemotherapy (paclitaxel, 50 mg/m2, carboplatin area under the curve of 2mg/mL/min, QW\*5). Then followed by two cycles of tislelizumab (200mg, Q3W). The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and safety.
