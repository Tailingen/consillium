SHR-A1904 Combinations in CLDN18.2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumor
This study consists of two research phases:

Phase Ib (includes dose escalation phase and efficacy extension phase): To explore the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of SHR-A1904 in the treatment of CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors, and to determine the recommended dose and recommended population for the Phase III combination study.

Phase III: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical study of SHR-1904 combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy Versus chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors.
