Nal-iri/lv5-fu Versus Paclitaxel as Second Line Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NALIRI plus 5FU versus paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ESCC who had failed to cisplatin- or oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy.

The hypotheses are as follows:

H0: the percentage of patients alive at 9 months of 40% is not useful. H1: the percentage of patients alive at 9 months of 60% is expected.

Progression-free survival, Clinical Progression-free survival and/or radiological Progression free survival will be evaluated, 5 years|Overall survival (OS), evaluate the overall survival, 1 year|Best response rate during treatment, Best response rate during treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (according to the investigator and with centralised review), 6 months|Toxicity (NCI-CTC v4), all observed toxicities, graded according to NCI-CTC v4 and the SAE, 6 months|Quality of life (questionnaires), Quality of life (QLQ-C30 questionnaires of EORTC) and OES18 questionnaires of EORTC, 6 months
Principal objective:

• To evaluate the survival of patients at 9 months

Secondary objectives:

* Progression-free survival (PFS) (clinical and/or radiological)
* Overall survival (OS)
* Best response rate during treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (according to the investigator and the centralised review committee)
* Toxicity (NCI CTC 4.0)
* Quality of life (QLQ-C30 and OES18 questionnaires of the EORTC)

Arm A (experimental arm): Nal IRI plus LV5-FU (D1=D28) Nal-IRI: 70 mg/m² intravenous over 90 minutes Followed by intravenous folinic acid 400 mg/m² over 30 minutes or L-folinic acid: 200 mg/m² over 30 minutes And then 5-FU 2,400 mg/m² over 46 hours on D1 to D14

Arm B (control arm): PACLITAXEL (D1=D28) Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at D1, D8 and D15

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the minimisation technique. Randomisation will be stratified based on the following factors:

* Centre
* WHO performance status: 0/1 versus 2

An analysis of circulating tumour DNA (using genetic mutations, in particular, TP53, and DNA methylation analyses) will be performed before the 1st cycle of treatment and at D28, in order to look for factors predictive of response to treatment (decrease in unbound DNA).
