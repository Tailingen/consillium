SKB410 for Injection in Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose dose finding and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic(PK) profile, and anti-tumor efficacy of SKB410 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: SKB410 for injection
Phase Ia :Number of subjects achieving Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) that meets protocol defined DLT criteria during cycle 1 and is at least possibly related to study drug., From data of initial dose until up to 28 days for treatment|Phase Ia :Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD refers to the highest dose at which the subject's DLT incidence meets the EWOC principle (probability of DLT incidence exceeding 33% is less than 25%) during the DLT observation period., From data of initial dose until up to 28 days for treatment|Phase Ib:ORR, ORR based on RECIST v1.1., through study completion, an average of 2 years
ORR, ORR: it refers to the proportion of subjects with best response of CR or PR after treatment., through study completion, an average of 2 years|DCR, DCR: it refers to the proportion of subjects with best response of response (PR + CR) and SD after treatment., through study completion, an average of 2 years|DOR, DOR: it refers to the time from the subject's first assessment of CR or PR to disease progression or death due to any cause., through study completion, an average of 2 years|PFS, PFS: it refers to the time from the start of treatment until disease progression (PD) or death., through study completion, an average of 2 years|OS, OS: it refers to the time from the first dose to death due to any cause (the last follow-up time for subjects who are lost to follow-up; the end of follow-up date for subjects who are still alive at the end of the study)., through study completion, an average of 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose dose finding and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile, and anti-tumor efficacy of SKB410 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.This study consists of two phases, Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Phase Ia is a dose escalation phase, and subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled to receive SKB410 for Injection; Phase Ib is a dose expansion phase, and the expansion dose(s) for specific cancer will be determined based on Phase Ia result.
