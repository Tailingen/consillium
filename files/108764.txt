Ipilimumab and All-Trans Retinoic Acid Combination Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with Ipilimumab and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in melanoma patients.
Melanoma
DRUG: VESANOID|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Number of Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of ipilimumab and VESANOID combination therapy in advanced melanoma patients will be established using the Bayesian approach., Up to 2 years from the time of study enrollment for each patient.|MDSC Frequency, The frequency of circulating MDSCs will be measured by flow cytometry and calculated as a percentage of the total myeloid cell population. This outcome will be measured at the final study blood draw between 84 and 130 days following the first treatment., 84 and 130 days following the first treatment|MDSC Suppressive Function, MDSC suppressive function in peripheral blood will be measured through the activation and proliferation of T cells in the presence of isolated MDSCs. Functional assays will be performed to assess the ability of isolated MDSCs to suppress T-cell responses., 4 weeks prior to start, Midway thru and at least 30 days post final infusion
Changes in the Frequency of Tumor-specific T Cell Responses, Changes in the frequency of tumor-specific T cell responses attributable to the addition of VESANOID to standard ipilimumab therapy will be determined by the frequency of Interferons (IFN)-gamma producing cells after stimulation with melanoma antigens., 4 weeks prior to start, Midway thru and at least 30 days post final infusion|Unresectable Stage III and STAGE IV, Subjects will be followed for evidence of disease progression., Up to 2 years from the time of study enrollment for each patient.
The successful treatment of melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies, has altered our thinking and approach to immunotherapy for solid tumors. Despite these advances, only a portion of patients experience a durable response suggesting that there is room for improvement via enhanced immunomodulatory approaches. Anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) significantly improves overall survival and achieves long-lasting complete responses in some melanoma patients, the number of patients that achieve durable clinical benefit is limited and could be improved by a combined immunomodulatory approach. The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with Ipilimumab and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in melanoma patients. We hypothesize that combined treatment with Ipilimumab and ATRA will improve patient responses, increase tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, and decrease immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in melanoma patients compared to patients treated with Ipilimumab alone.
