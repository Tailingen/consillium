Oxaliplatin Combined With Irinotecan Liposome Injection II Through Hepatic Artery Infusion (HAIC) Followed by 5-FU/LV (HAIC) or Tegorgor Oral Combination Therapy for Hepatic Metastasis of Pancreatic Cancer
The study explores the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin combined with irinotecan liposome injection II via hepatic arterial infusion (HAIC) followed by sequential treatment with 5-FU/LV (HAIC) or oral administration of S-1 in patients with liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer after the failure of first-line treatment with the AG regimen. This research aims to accumulate more clinical evidence and treatment options for second-line therapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer.
