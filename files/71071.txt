The Effectiveness and Safety of Intravesical Docetaxel Instillation for Prevent Bladder Recurrence
The investigators evaluated the efficacy of a single early intravesical instillation of doxetaxel in the prevention of bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy or distal ureterectomy for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC).

Approximately 20% to 50% of patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC) experience bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy. Although many agents have been administered for the prevention of bladder recurrence, the standard prophylactic treatment has yet to be established. A meta-analysis found that a single instillation of chemotherapy immediately after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) significantly decreased the risk of recurrence in patients with bladder cancer. Indeed, a single early instillation of Docetaxel was found to reduce the post-TURBT bladder recurrence rate among patients with bladder cancer.

In this prospective, randomized study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of a single, early, intravesical instillation of Docetaxel in the prevention of bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy for UUT-UC.
