Quantitative HPV Genotyping in Screening of Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia in HIV-positive Patients
The pathophysiology from anal HPV infection to Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia is less well understood than cervical HPV infection. In cervical screening programs it is well accepted that the sole presence of a high-risk HPV strain (irrespective of number of viral particles) is sufficient to justify further investigation and treatment. The investigators hypothesize that in anal HPV infection not only the presence but the extent of HPV infection (single genotype viral load) or combination of different HPV genotypes (cumulative viral load) is of importance in determining the risk of anal dysplasia.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HPV genotyping
Incidence of HPV subtypes in HIV-positive patients, Retrieval of 1 anal swab before performing HRA to determine the HPV subtypes at that particular moment, 1 minute
Correlation between high-resolution anoscopy findings and quantitative HPV genotyping, Performing HRA (30 minutes) with or without biopsies, results biopsies up to 10 days, 30 minutes up to 10 days
