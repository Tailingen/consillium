Study to Describe the Management and the Use of Healthcare Resources in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Initiating Venetoclax in Routine Clinical Practice
A study to assess the real-life management and use of healthcare resources during the initiation of:

* Venetoclax in combination with rituximab is indicated for the treatment of adult participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.
* Venetoclax in participants with CLL with the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del\[17p\]) who have received at least 1 prior therapy or participants with CLL without del(17p) who have received at least 1 prior therapy and for whom there are no other available treatment options.
