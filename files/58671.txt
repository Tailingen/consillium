Preoperative CA 19.9 Level Predicts Lymph Node Metastasis in Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Head of the Pancreas.
In our multicenter retrospective study, preoperative CA 19.9 levels predicts the presence of lymph node metastasis at final histology in patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma .
Pancreas Cancer
Quantitative data - Preoperatory levels of CA 19.9 (U/ml), Define relation of quantitative data (CA 19.9 (U/ml)) with nodal positivity at the final pathological report, 20 years
A retrospective analysis have been conducted on more than 2.000 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma radiologically resectable at the preoperative staging. Preoperatory levels of CA 19.9 were measured in order to identify a relation with nodal involvement at the pathological staging.
