Study on Androgen Receptor and Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter uncontrolled, open-label, prospective, non-comparative randomized, phase II study. Patients will be randomized between darolutamide in Arm n°1 (two-stage Simon's design) and capecitabine in Arm n°2 with two patients randomized in Arm n°1 for one patient randomized in Arm n°2.

The trial population is composed of women over 18 years old with triple-negative and androgen receptor positive, locally recurrent (unresectable) or metastatic breast cancer.
