Comparison Between Internal Jugular Vein Versus Axillary Vein for Implantable Ports
Comparison between internal jugular vein versus via axillary vein with single-incision for placement of implantable ports in cancer patients. Investigators are recruiting 240 patients and randomizing 120 for each arm. Primary outcome is early complications, until 30 days and secondary outcome late complications, between 30 days and 6 months. The follow-up is 12 months.

Early complications., Early complications within 30 days during clinical assessment. These outcomes are divided in intra-operative complications, such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, vascular injury, cardiac arrhythmia, hematoma; and post-operative until 30 days complications such as wound infections, catheter related bacteremia, catheter disfunction, catheter related deep venous thrombosis, reservoir extrusion and skin erosion., 30 days
Late complications, Post-operative between 30 days and 6 months complications such as wound infections, catheter related bacteremia, catheter disfunction, catheter related deep venous thrombosis, reservoir extrusion and skin erosion., 30 to 180 days
Prospective and randomized trial comparing internal jugular vein versus via axillary vein with single-incision for placement of implantable ports in cancer patients. Investigators are recruiting 240 patients and randomizing 120 for each arm in a single center study at AC Camargo Cancer Center. Every surgery is assisted by ultrasound and radioscopic and the catheter is districathÂ®, 8.5 French. Clinical assessment will be at 10 days and every 3 months after surgery. Primary outcome is early complications, until 30 days and secondary outcome late complications, between 30 days and 6 months. The follow-up is 12 months.
