Substudy 03A: A Study of Immune and Targeted Combination Therapies in Participants With First Line (1L) Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-03A)
Substudy 03A is part of a larger research study that is testing experimental treatments for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The larger study is the umbrella study (U03).

The goal of substudy 03A is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental combinations of investigational agents in participants with advanced first line (1L) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

This substudy will have two phases: a safety lead-in phase and an efficacy phase. The safety lead-in phase will be used to demonstrate a tolerable safety profile for the combination of investigational agents. There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.

Safety Lead-in Phase: Number of participants who experience one or more dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as one or more of the following toxicities: (1) grade (gr) 4 nonhematologic toxicity (2) gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting \>7 days OR gr 4 platelet count decreased of any duration OR gr 3 platelet count decreased if associated with bleeding (3) gr 3 nonhematologic toxicity except gr 3 fatigue (lasting ≤3 days), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or rash without standard of care (4) gr 3 or 4 nonhematologic abnormality if medical intervention is required or if it leads to hospitalization or persists for \>1 week (5) gr 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (6) gr 3 or 4 alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and/or bilirubin laboratory value (7) treatment related adverse event (AE) causing study intervention discontinuation during the first 21 days (8) treatment related AE causing intervention administration delay for \>14 days during the first 21 days (9) gr 5 toxicity. The number of participants who experience one or more DLTs in the safety lead-in phase will be presented., Up to ~21 days|Safety Lead-in Phase: Number of participants who experience one or more adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience one or more AEs in the safety lead-in phase will be presented., Up to ~21 days|Safety Lead-in Phase: Number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE in the safety lead-in phase will be presented., Up to ~21 days|Efficacy Phase: Number of participants who experience one or more DLTs, DLTs are defined as one or more of the following toxicities: (1) grade (gr) 4 nonhematologic toxicity (2) gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting \>7 days OR gr 4 platelet count decreased of any duration OR gr 3 platelet count decreased if associated with bleeding (3) gr 3 nonhematologic toxicity except gr 3 fatigue (lasting ≤3 days), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or rash without standard of care (4) gr 3 or 4 nonhematologic abnormality if medical intervention is required or if it leads to hospitalization or persists for \>1 week (5) gr 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (6) gr 3 or 4 alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and/or bilirubin laboratory value (7) treatment related adverse event (AE) causing study intervention discontinuation during the first 21 days (8) treatment related AE causing intervention administration delay for \>14 days during the first 21 days (9) gr 5 toxicity. The number of participants who experience one or more DLTs in the efficacy phase will be presented., Up to ~21 days|Efficacy Phase: Number of participants who experience one or more AEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience one or more AEs in the efficacy phase will be presented., Up to ~43 months|Efficacy Phase: Number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE in the efficacy phase will be presented., Up to ~43 months|Efficacy Phase: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters). Responses are according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to ~43 months
Efficacy Phase: Duration of response (DOR), For participants in the analysis population who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR., Up to ~43 months|Efficacy Phase: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR., Up to ~43 months|Efficacy Phase: Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~43 months|Efficacy Phase: Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) or stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease) of ≥6 months. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR., Up to ~43 months
