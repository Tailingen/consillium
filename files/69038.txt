Identifying Immune-related Biomarkers to Predict the Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy
The development of Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) is a revolution in medical oncology as ICB have changed the standard treatments of several metastatic tumor types. However, the response rate to ICB is low, and the biological bases for this response heterogeneity are poorly understood.

In the frame of Immunosup study, we will collect blood (at baseline, post infusion of ICB n°2/4/8 and at progression) and tumor samples (optional: at baseline and progression) from patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer, treated with ICB, in order to determine if the dynamics of immunosuppressive actors (MDSC, TReg, Immunosuppressive cytokines) predicts response to these immunotherapies.

PROCEDURE: Blood sample collection|PROCEDURE: Biopsy collection
Evaluation of Plasma immunosuppressive actors in patients treated with a Checkpoint inhibitor, Measure (by flux cytometry) and comparison of plasma immunosuppressive actors, between baseline and the 4th injection of an Immune Checkpoint inhibitor, 4 months
