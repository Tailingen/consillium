Engineered Immune Effectors Against Cervical Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of cervical cancer specific engineered immune effectors (CC-EIEs). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the rate of successful CC-EIE generation in vitro and determine the anti-CC efficacy.
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CC-EIEs
Safety of CC-EIEs in patients using CTCAE version 4.0 standard to evaluate the level of adverse events, Physiological parameter (measuring cytokine response, fever, symptoms), 6 months
Functional analyses of CC-EIEs in vitro, The specificity of CC-EIEs in vitro will be analysed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT)., 4 weeks|Anti-tumor effects, Objective response, such as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) will be assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., 1 year
Cervical cancer (CC) is a cancer arising from the cervix. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes more than 90% of the cases. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Worldwide, CC is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. The treatment of CC consists of surgical intervention, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific viral antigens has proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple infusions of CC-specific engineered immune effectors including cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients.
