Interactive Cancer Communication System (ICCS) Directed Physical Activity Enhancement for Colon Cancer Survivors
This study will develop and test the benefits of a new ICCS (Interactive Cancer Communication System), a mobile Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (Survivorship CHESS) in colon cancer survivors. Survivorship CHESS will provide information, tools, and a support system based on our previous work with FRESH START and CHESS, two highly successful interventions that have promoted lifestyle change among cancer patients and survivors. Survivorship CHESS will be designed to help subjects develop 1) competence in information gathering, decision-making, and behaviors they are trying to change, 2) social support systems to help deal with the cancer experience, and 3) autonomy that comes with regaining a sense of control over their lives; this in turn, will help them adopt or maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors and improve their quality of life.

Change in level of physical activity, To determine whether stage I-III colon cancer survivors who are randomized to Survivorship CHESS, as compared to those who are assigned to usual care, demonstrate significantly greater increases in levels of physical activity from baseline to completion of the intervention (6 M intervention period)., 6 M intervention period
