Belzutifan/MK-6482 for the Treatment of Advanced Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma (PPGL), Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor (pNET), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease-Associated Tumors, Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (wt GIST), or Solid Tumors With HIF-2α Related Genetic Alterations (MK-6482-015)
This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belzutifan monotherapy in participants with advanced pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors, advanced wt (wild-type) gastrointestinal stromal tumor (wt GIST), or advanced solid tumors with hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2α) related genetic alterations. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of belzutifan per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma|Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor|Von Hippel-Lindau Disease|Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor|HIF-2α Mutated Cancers
DRUG: Belzutifan
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is the percentage of participants with complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions) until progressive disease (PD, at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5.5 years
Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR, DOR is the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Time to Response (TTR) as Assessed by BICR, TTR is defined as the time from first dose of belzutifan to first documented evidence of CR or PR., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by BICR, Disease control is a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study)., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Progressive Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by BICR, PFS is the time from first dose of belzutifan to the first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from first dose of belzutifan until death from any cause., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug due to an AE, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 5.5 years|Time to Surgery (TTS), TTS is defined as the time from the first dose of belzutifan to the first documented surgical intervention or tumor reduction procedure., Up to approximately 5.5 years
