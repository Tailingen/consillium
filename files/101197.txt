Laser Therapy for the Prevention of Radiodermatitis in Head and Neck Patients
Up to 90% of the radiotherapy patients will develop a certain degree of skin reaction at the treated area, also known as radiodermatitis (RD).

Currently, there is a wide variety of strategies to manage RD, including creams, gels, ointments, wound dressings. However, up to now, there is still no comprehensive, evidence-based consensus for the treatment of RD. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising, non-invasive technique for treating RD. In a recent study conducted in our research group, LLLT prevented the aggravation of RD and provided symptomatic relief in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer after breast-sparing surgery. This was the first prospective study investigating the potential of LLLT for RD. In the current study, we want to investigate the efficacy of LLLT as a tool for the prevention of radiodermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.
