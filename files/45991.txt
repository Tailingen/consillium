Phase I Study of HL-085 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The study drug, HL-085 is a MEK inhibitor with the potential indication for cancers. It is an oral medication to be given daily.

The purposes of this study is to find answers to the following research questions:

1. What is the highest tolerable dose of HL-085 that can be given to subjects when given orally (by mouth) on a twice daily basis?
2. What are the side effects of HL-085?
3. How much HL-085 is in the blood at specific times after dosing and how does the body get rid of the HL-085?
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: HL-085
Adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.|Dose limitation toxicities (DLT), A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following AE considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the IP, HL-085, by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor that occurs during Cycle 1 as described in below:

* Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes; or
* Non-hematologic toxicities Grade 3 or higher.
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, or other hematologic toxicity at Grade 4 or above.
* Neutropenic fever
* liver parameter abnormalities
* Any toxicity requiring permanent discontinuation of the IP, During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which DLT occurs in less than 33.3% of subjects., MTD will be determined when DLT occurs in great or equal to 33.3% of the same cohort subjects during During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)
cMAX, cMAX is the maximum plasma concentration of HL-085 or metabolite(s)., Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months
pERK expression, Correlation between phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (pERK) expression and efficacy endpoints., Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months
