Phase II of Lenvatinib Plus Toripalimab for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib combined with toripalimab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Toripalimab
6 months progression free survival rates, Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review according to RECIST, version 1.1, criteria or death from any cause., 6 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first., 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions, 6 months|Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 6 months
Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus toripalimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this single-arm, prospective, phase II study to find out it.
