The Effect of Nutrition for the Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy-randomized Controlled Study
We use clinical trial to explore the effect of nutrition support in colorectal cancer patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Taiwan. Side effects induced by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy will affect nutrition status and may delay treatment and affect prognosis. Sarcopenia may be noted in some patients and increase the toxicities of chemotherapy. The studies of intervention include nutrition consultant and treatment like protein, fish oil or Vitamin D supplement. Premium amino acids include multiple amino acids and organic Selenium and have effect in inhibition of tumor proliferation according to colorectal cancer cell and animal experiments.
