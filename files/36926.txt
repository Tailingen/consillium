A Phase Ib Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Plus Sorafenib in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This is a research study of a radiation treatment called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plus a medicine called sorafenib. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of SBRT plus Sorafenib to see what effects (good and bad) it has on the treatment of liver cancer.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Sorafenib|RADIATION: Stereotactic radiotherapy
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Start of sorafenib through disease progression, an expected average of 12 months.
Number of patients with local response, The local response rate, local clinical benefit rate,and local tumor shrinkage rate (LCR+LPR+LSD's)will be tabulated. Response will be measured according to a modification of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)., Start of sorafenib through disease progression, an expected average of 12 months|Time from the start of the treatment until the criteria for overall disease progression is met or death occurs., Start of sorafenib through disease progression, an expected average of 12 months.|Time from start of treatment until death from any cause or date of last patient contact., Start of soafenib until death.
3.2.3 Evaluate pharmacodynamic changes in tumor vascular parameters (e.g blood flow, blood volume, and time to peak in ROC (receiver operator characteristics curve) by DCE-MRI and correlate with efficacy outcomes, Baseline to disease progression|3.2.4 To evaluate biologic markers such as VEGF, eNOS and HIF1-alpha, VEGF-R2 genetic polymorphisms as well as serum VEGF and soluble VEGFR2 levels and correlate with efficacy outcomes., Baseline to disease progression
