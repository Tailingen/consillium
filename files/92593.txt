Optimizing Active Surveillance in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: a Pilot Study
This is a pilot evaluation of a patient-centered intervention that enables providers to support men on active surveillance to maximize adherence. Conducted in urology practices, this pilot will measure key patient-reported, provider-reported, and implementation outcomes. Successful completion of this work will inform a subsequent multi-center effectiveness-implementation hybrid design trial and ultimately will improve low-risk cancer management by effectively engaging Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) in care delivery.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: web-based tool (MAP- Management of Active surveillance in Prostate Cancer)|BEHAVIORAL: MUSIC website
Feasibility - recruitment, Defined as the successful recruitment of 40 patients., up to 9 months post last patient recruitment|Feasibility - Uptake, Defined as the proportion of men who complete the baseline and follow-up surveys out of the total number of patients recruited., up to 6 months post last patient recruitment|Acceptability - Mean Satisfaction Scores, Acceptability asks the extent to which participants consider the intervention is agreeable. Patients in the intervention arm will answer questions (on a 5-point Likert scale) regarding the use of the tool including: a) the tool provided me the necessary information about being on active surveillance; b) the tool helped me know what tests I needed and when; c) the tool helped me understand what my PCP can do for my active surveillance; d) the tool was easy to use; e) the amount of time it took to go through the website; and f) I would recommend the tool to other patients. We will ask an open-ended question on if the tool should have any other features in future versions. We will additionally collect paradata such as user actions (clicks) and time spent on each webpage., up to 4 months post last patient completing intervention
