Hema-NeoTIL01 Cell Infusion Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Leukemia
This clinical trial aims to investigate the safety, optimal dosage, and effectiveness of autologous tumor-specific T cells, known as Hema-NeoTIL0 in treating relapsed/refractory B-ALL/AML.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Hema-NeoTIL01
CR/CRi, MRD-negative CR, Complete remission (CR) is defined as the presence of less than 5% bone marrow blasts in an aspirate containing spicules, accompanied by independence from transfusions.

CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) is defined as the presence of less than 5% bone marrow blasts, with either an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1×10\^9/L or a platelet count of less than 100×10\^9/L, while remaining transfusion-independent but exhibiting persistent cytopenia.

Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR is defined as a leukemic cell count below the sensitivity threshold of 1×10\^-4 (0.01%) of bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs), as measured by multiparameter flow cytometry., Within 28 days after the first dose
RFS, Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as the interval from the date of achieving CR to the first occurrence of leukemia relapse, death, or the date of the last follow-up., 2 years|OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the time of enrollment to death from any cause., 2 years|Adverse events, The number of adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0., Within 28 days after the first dose
Primary Objective:

To assess the safety of Hema-NeoTIL01 in the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute leukemia (B-ALL/AML).

Secondary Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of Hema-NeoTIL01 in relapsed/refractory acute leukemia (B-ALL/AML).
