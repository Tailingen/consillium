A Real-world Study of Camrelizumab Alone or in Combination With Apatinib/Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab and apatinib in patients with advanced gastric cancer under real-life conditions, particularly in various subgroups of gastric cancer patients, with a view to providing information about the treatment modalities and efficacy of the treatment in real-life gastric cancer patients and to explore the possible predictive biomarkers of prognosis.Patients, who had both decided to be treated with camrelizumab or apatinib prior to enrollment, were entered into one of the following three cohorts at the discretion of the investigator, based on their disease stage and prior treatment
