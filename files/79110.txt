Mood Alterations in the Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Treated With BCG
The purpose of this study is to evaluate mood changes in patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer who are receiving intravesical Bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG). Patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer receiving intravesical treatments are eligible to participate in this study. Participation involves providing research blood and urine samples prior to the start of treatment and throughout the treatment course. The study team will also collect participant's medical history and clinical information. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and daily mood diaries.

Change in cytokine response as assessed by urine samples, Collect urine samples from the patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who are undergoing intravesical instillations for cytokine response to treatment, Prior to each 6-week intravesical treatment and every 3-month Cystoscopy for 24 months|Change in cytokine response as assessed by blood samples, Collect blood samples from the patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who are undergoing intravesical instillations for cytokine response to treatment, Prior to the first intravesical treatment, prior to the fourth intravesical treatment, and prior to the each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy|Screening for Mood Disorders utilizing the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale, Screen for mood disorders in patients diagnosed with Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer at baseline and while undergoing treatment utilizing the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale. The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale has the following score ranges: Normal Range (25-49), Mildly Depressed (50-59), Moderately Depressed (60-69), Severely Depressed (70 and above), Prior to each induction intravesical treatment for six weeks and each 3-month surveillance visit
Screening for Mood Disorders utilizing the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale, Screen for mood disorders in patients diagnosed with Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer at baseline and while undergoing treatment utilizing the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale, Prior to each induction intravesical treatment for six weeks and each 3-month surveillance visit|Screening for Mood Disorders utilizing daily mood diaries, Screening for Mood Disorders at baseline and through the treatment course with daily mood diaries, Daily mood diary for 6-week induction intravesical treatment course, daily mood diary for 3-week intravesical treatment maintenance course, and daily mood diary between 3-month follow up cystoscopy appointments|Evaluate DNA and RNA-based liquid biopsy biomarkers and correlate them with tissue response, Collect blood and urine samples from the patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who are undergoing intravesical instillations and compare them with excess tissue from a clinically indicated procedure, Prior to the first intravesical treatment, prior to the fourth intravesical treatment, and prior to each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy
Patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer who are receiving intravesical treatments are eligible to participate in this study. Participants will be asked to complete the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale prior to each induction intravesical treatment. During the 6-week induction intravesical treatment, participants will also be given a daily mood dairy to complete. Urine Specimens will be collected prior to each induction intravesical treatment and at each 3-month cystoscopy appointment during the treatment course. An at home urine collection may occur 6 hours post intravesical treatment. Research Blood Samples will be collected prior to the first induction intravesical treatment, prior to the fourth intravesical treatment, and prior to each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy as indicated by the participant's treatment course. Participants will be asked to complete the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale prior to each 3-month follow-up cystoscopy during the treatment course. A 3-week daily mood diary will be completed by participants during the 3-week intravesical maintenance treatment. Participants will be given a daily mood diary to complete between the 3-month follow-up cystoscopy appointments.
