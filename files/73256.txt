Pembrolizumab in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Skin Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with skin cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
Recurrent Skin Carcinoma|Skin Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Response Rate of Pembrolizumab, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation (max treatment duration of 3 years)
Overall Survival, Number of patients who were alive 1 year after their respective treatment completion dates, Up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation (max treatment duration of 3 years)|Progression-free Survival, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Up to 6 months after treatment discontinuation (max treatment duration of 3 years)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

-To establish the response rate of pembrolizumab in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

-To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and 1 year overall survival of metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (cSCC) treated with pembrolizumab.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8-12 weeks.
