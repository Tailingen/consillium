A Study Evaluating the Safety of Cal-1 (LVsh5/C46) Drug Product in HIV-1 Infected Patient With High Risk Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the feasibility, and the success of engraftment of the introduction of Cal-1 gene-transduced haematopoietic cell populations (Ttn and HSPCtn) in patients with HIV-1-related high-risk lymphoma.
HIV-1 Infection
DRUG: Cal-1 (LVsh5/C46) drug product
Incidence of adverse event post transplant, to evaluate the procedure safety, 24 months post-transplant|Success of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment, evaluation of Cal-1 marking and expression in peripheral blood subpopulations (monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes), 24 months post-transplant
Overall survival, 24 months post-transplant|Absence of detection of vector-derived Replication competent lentivirus (RCL), 24 months post-transplant|Frequency and severity of clinical adverse events, as assessed by the United States national Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 24 months post-transplant|Absence of tropism shift from R5 to dual/mixed or X4 at any point after Day 0, 24 months post-transplant|Quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, extent of HSPCtn and Ttn survival as measured by Cal-1 marking and expression in peripheral blood, 24 months post-transplant|Time to restart antiretroviral therapy, 24 months post-transplant
