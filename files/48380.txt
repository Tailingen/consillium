A Study to Evaluate Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-Tumor Activity of RO7300490, as Single Agent or in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
A study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of RO7300490 as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab. The study will consist of 3 parts: \[Part 1\] Dose-Escalation of RO7300490 as a single agent; \[Part 2\] Dose-Escalation of RO7300490 in combination with atezolizumab and \[Part 3\] Dose-Expansion of RO7300490 in combination with atezolizumab in selected cancer types.
