IL-1 Inhibition in Early TNBC
This study will examine changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) induced by 14 days of pre-operative IL-1-inhibiting therapy among patients with early breast cancer (including TNBC and ER-low positive). Key immune biomarkers (TILs, TAMs, NK cells, IL1\[beta\] and inflammasome component expression) will be evaluated at baseline and following 14 days of IL-1 antagonist therapy (Anakinra) using paired tissue specimens.
Early Stage Triple Negative ER Low Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anakinra (KineretÂ®)
To determine the changes in the breast cancer TME in paired patient samples (core biopsy and surgical specimen) before and after 14 days of treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist, Anakinra., 2 years
