Predictive Multimodal Signatures Associated With Response to Treatment and Prognosis of Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Predicting response to therapy and disease progression in stage IV NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, chemotherapy-pembrolizumab combination therapy or chemotherapy alone in the first-line setting.
