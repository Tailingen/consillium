Stem Cell Analysis, Omics (Including Immunomics) and Artificial Intelligence in Glioblastoma
The study aims at:

1. Perform a multilayer analysis relying on tight integration of in-depth multi-omics approaches with clinical data to discover immune markers, with attention to age and sex differences, predicting prognosis and defining key life/environmental elements, to guide AI-driven personalised treatments and ensure improved care and QoL of glioblastoma patients.
2. To deepen glioblastoma knowledge through the study of glioblastoma stem cell cultures and to assess the sensitivity of glioblastoma stem cell cultures to a number of chemotherapeutics in different experimental conditions.
3. To create a comprehensive, stakeholder-generated guidelines for the ethical use of patient data for artificial intelligence-assisted prediction systems in glioblastoma, including an online, easily accessible patient information brochure to increase patient empowerment in the field.
Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype
OTHER: Biological biomarker analysis
Identification of immune signatures in glioblastoma predictive of overall survival, Immune omic markers, namely the tumor count of the different lymphocyte subtypes and of T-cell receptor subtypes, will be correlated with overall survival., 36 months|identification of lifestyle/environmental signatures predictive of overall survival, A questionnaire investigating lifestyle/environmental patients features, including dietary habits, will be developed. Questionnaire data will be correlated with overall survival., 36 months|Cancer stem cell-based chemosensitivity assay, Assessment of the in vitro sensitivity of patient-derived cancer stem cells to chemotherapeutics, 36 months
