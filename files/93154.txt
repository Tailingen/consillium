Evaluation of the Role of Prostaglandins in Radiation-induced Mucositis
This study will evaluate the role of cyclooxygenase pathways in radiation-induced and chemoradiation-induced mucositis.
Cancer of the Head and Neck|Radiotherapy
Salivary levels of PGE2 and PGI2 during and after radiotherapy, 10 weeks after initiation of therapy
Observed mucositis during and after radiotherapy, 10 weeks after initiation of radiotherapy|Patient reports of oral pain during and after radiation therapy, 10 weeks after initiation of radiotherapy
Oral mucositis is a significant toxicity of radiation therapy and chemoradiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients. However the mechanisms that induce such mucositis are not completely understood. Previous work evaluating mucositis in bone marrow transplant patients has suggested that prostaglandin levels may be associated with the appearance of mucositis.

The present study will measure the levels in saliva of the prostaglandins PGE2 and PGI2 before, during, immediately after, and several weeks after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. These salivary levels will be correlated with clinical observation of mucositis and patient reporting of pain levels.

Improved understanding of the mechanism of mucositis may lead to the development of more effective targeted agents to prevent this problem.
