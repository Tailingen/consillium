Radical Versus Conservative Surgical Treatment of Liver Hydatid Cysts
The management of liver hydatid cysts (LHC) is controversial. Surgery remains the basic treatment, and can be divided into radical and conservative approaches. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of radical and conservative surgery (CS) in the treatment of LHC and to evaluate the efficiency and safety of radical surgery (RS).

PROCEDURE: hydatid cyst resection
recurrence of hydatic cyst, recurrence of hydatid cyst after surgery, 2 years
The management of liver hydatid cysts (LHC) is controversial. Surgery remains the basic treatment, and can be divided into radical and conservative approaches. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome of radical and conservative surgery (CS) in the treatment of LHC and to evaluate the efficiency and safety of radical surgery (RS).

Data from all patients with LHC treated in Sahloul Hospital, between January 2000 and December 2019, were retrieved from a retrospective database. To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed, based on variables representing patient characteristics and operative risk factors.

RS especially total pericystectomy had fewer postoperative complications and lower recurrence rate compared to CS. RS may be the preferred procedure for LHC if the expertise is available.
