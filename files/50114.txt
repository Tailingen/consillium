A Study to Compare the Effectiveness and Safety of IBI310 Combined With Sintilimab Versus Sorafenib in the First-line Treatment of Advanced HCC
This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter Phase III study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IBI310 combined with sintilimab and sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC who have not previously received systemic therapy, are unsuitable for radical surgical resection or local treatment, or have had progressive disease after surgical resection or local treatment.
