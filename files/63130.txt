Osimertinib to Suppress the Progression of GGN(EGFR Mutation-positive)
This study designed to assess the efficacy of osimertinib (80 mg, orally, once daily) to suppress the progression of remaining GGN(s) in other lobes following surgical resection for actionable EGFR mutation-positive stage I lung adenocarcinoma.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib 80 MG
To assess the efficacy of osimertinib on the regression of additional GGN(s), Regression rate of additional GGNs using investigator assessments by comparing the size of GGN(s) on the initial CT scan (at randomization) to that in the last follow-up scan. We will conduct the quantitative analysis of GGNs on the initial and follow-up CT scans via VOI (Volume of Interest) segmentation. VOI is measured with the unit of mm3., up to 12months
To assess the efficacy of osimertinib in avoidance of subsequent anticancer treatments including surgery or radiation for GGN(s), Avoidance rate of subsequent surgeries or radiation treatments for GGN(s) within one year since the initiation of osimertinib treatment: Defined as the number (percent) of patients who do not require subsequent anticancer treatments including surgeries or radiation for remaining GGN(s) within one year since the initiation of osimertinib treatment, up to 12months|To evaluate when GGN(s) will regress after osimertinib treatment, Time to regression: Defined as the length of time from the date of initiation of osimertinib treatment to the first date of GGN regression, up to 12months|To evaluate the rate of treatment failure, Incidence of regrowth and reappearance of remaining GGN(s) within one year since the initiation of osimertinib treatment, up to 12months|To evaluate the number of patients with new nodules, Number of patients who would have growing new nodules (either ground glass nodules or solid nodules) with high suggestion of lung cancer by lung-special radiologists within one year since the initiation of Osimertinib treatment, up to 12months|To assess the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of osimertinib, Incidence of adverse events and grades based on CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 5.0., up to 12months
