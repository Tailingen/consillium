Radiation Therapy and Intratumoral Autologous Dendritic Cells in Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS)
The purpose of this study is to determine if injection of the participant's our own immune related white blood cells (called dendritic cells) into their tumor will strengthen their immune system to fight against their cancer.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
PROCEDURE: External Beam Radiation Therapy (RT)|BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Dendritic Cells
Number of Participants With Enhanced T Lymphocyte Immune Response Specific for Soft Tissue Sarcoma Tumor Associated Antigens(STS-TAAs), Investigate the ability of an intensified radiation therapy (RT) regimen (namely, conventional RT with a high-dose hypofractionated boost) and Dendritic Cell (DC) administration to induce an enhanced T lymphocyte immune response specific for STS-TAAs. Criteria for immune response evaluation: Individual patients were considered as responders to TAAs if at any time point the response in IFN-γ ELISPOT assay was found higher than 30 spots per 200,000 cells or in proliferation assay higher than 3000 counts/min (CPM) AND the response in IFN-γ ELISPOT or proliferation assays to tumor cell lysates (TCL) or Ad-Surv was found more than 2SD higher than the response to corresponding control lysate or Ad-c at the same time point AND 2SD higher than the response to the same stimuli at a base line (before start of the treatment)., 11 weeks per participant
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs), Evaluate the safety of intratumoral injections of DCs in combination with an intensified RT regimen patients with high-grade large STS. Toxicity assessments were performed weekly to include assessments for: constitutional symptoms, fever, fatigue; common radiation side effects; special attention was paid to DC injection and biopsy related toxicity. Only treatment related SAEs and AEs are reported for this measure., 11 weeks per participant
