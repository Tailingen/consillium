Effects of Exercise Oncology Intervention in Fitness Capacity and Body Composition in Breast Cancer Survivals
The goal of this interventional study is to analyze the impact of a supervised oncological exercise intervention in surviving breast cancer patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Evaluate the efectivity of a supervised individualized and adapted oncological physical exercise program in the cardiovascular fitness of the participants.
* Analyze the impact of this intervention in the body composition, functionality and quality of life of the parcitipants

Participants will perform a controlled and adapted program, supervised by an especialized professional during 16 weeks.

Researchers will compare this intervention group, where the supervised program will take place, with a control group, where the patients will perform regular physical activity (non-supervised) to see the changes in the efectivity and impact in cardiovascular fitness, body composition and quality of life.
