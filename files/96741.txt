A Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether giving 177Lu-PSMA-617 followed by a type of radiation therapy called SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy) is a safe treatment for your cancer. The study agent has been shown to target tumor cells, and the researchers think that adding 177Lu-PSMA-617 to SBRT may prevent or delay the cancer from continuing to spread.
