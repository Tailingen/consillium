Soluble B7-H3 as a Biomarker for Osteosarcoma
Increasing data has indicated an association between increased soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) levels and unfavorable prognosis in patients with malignancies. However, the level of sB7-H3 and its clinical significance in osteosarcoma are not well known. In this present study, we investigated whether sB7-H3 levels in serum could be as a biomarker for osteosarcoma treatment.
