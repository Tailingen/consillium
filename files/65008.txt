HAIC Plus Toripalimab vs. HAIC Plus Sorafenib for HCC With PVTT: a Non-comparative, Prospective, Randomized Trial
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus toripalimab versus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: systemic treatment
Progression free survival rate at 6 months, Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review according to RECIST or death from any cause, 6 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of randomization until death from any cause., 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause., 6 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the proportion of all randomized subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR., 6 months|Adverse events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., 6 months
Our previous study showed that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus sorafenib was more effective and safe than sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has compared HAIC plus toripalimab with HAIC plus sorafenib. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, randomized, non-comparative study to find out it.
