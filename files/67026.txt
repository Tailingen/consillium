Diclofenac is a local and systemic anti-inflammatory drug and it reduces local mediators involved in local pain.The purpose of this study is to find out the role of rectal administration of diclofenac suppositories as an adjunct to 2% xylocaine gel in alleviating intra and post procedural pain in prostatic biopsy with adequately calculated sample size and excluding the patients with contraindication to procedure or diclofenac administration as these were the shortcomings of previous studies.
