Assessment of Early Treatment Response by Diffusion and Perfusion MRI in Patients With Brain Metastasis
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic study that makes pictures of organs of the body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses that can not be felt. The purpose of this study is to determine if new imaging methods can help tumor evaluation in the brain. The extra images will be obtained using diffusion and perfusion MRI techniques to assess early treatment response in patients with brain metastasis, and will be compared to methods currently being used.
Brain Cancer
PROCEDURE: MRI
feasibility of diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), This is a technology assessment protocol for response to treatment. The study is designed to assess the utility of the technology using a limited number of participants. We will assess whether the MR parameters are predictive markers of early response., 1 year
