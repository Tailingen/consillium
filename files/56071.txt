New Methods of Distribution of a Self Sampler Kit for Cervical Cancer Screening
The opportunity of a home, self-collected sample, opens the chance to remove some of the barriers that may discourage women from participating to screening programmes or performing HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)-test. Self-sampling is less time consuming and invasive as compared with tests performed at a clinic. It allows for privacy, reduces discomfort and women know nobody would have to handle their body.

Study hypothesis: The use of a self-sampler may increase the recovery of non-responders women at cervical cancer screening.
Cervical Cancer Cin Grade
performing a HPV test within 3 months since the recall letter, up to december 2012 (up to 3 months)
How many of the women performing a test after intervention were never-screened or under-screened (last test more than 3 years before), up to december 2012 (up to 3 months)
In a previous trial (ISRCTN96071600) the investigators tested on 2400 women, compliance with self sampler device (PantaRhei Devices, Zeist, the Netherlands).

With this study the investigators analyze the response to two channels of transmission of the device (a model of device easier, and less expensive than the previous), such as screening for colon cancer.

The shipment of the device at home and taking on a local pharmacy. Involving 15000 women non-responders to previous calls in five different screening programs in Italy (Rome, Bologna, Abruzzo region, Molise region, Veneto region).
