Influence of Opioid Analgesia on Circulating Tumor Cells in Open Colorectal Cancer Surgery
To compare the effects of three types of perioperative analgesia on the number of circulating tumor cells following radical colorectal cancer surgery. To find correlations with other perioperative factors and clinical/pathological disease characteristics.
Colorectal Cancer|Circulating Tumor Cell
DRUG: Morphine|DRUG: Piritramid|DRUG: Epidural
Change in number of circulating tumor cells prior to surgery to 2 - 4 weeks after surgery, Baseline number of circulating tumor cells will be recorded prior to surgery in a venous blood sample. Number of circulating tumor cells will be measured 2 - 4 weeks after surgery in a venous blood sample. These two values will be compared., 1 - 3 days before surgery to 4 weeks after surgery
Pain assessment, Pain intensity assessed using Numerical Rating Scale (0-10), 3 days postoperatively
