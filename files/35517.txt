Effects of Yoga, Strength Training and Aerobic Exercise on Cognition in Adult Cancer Survivors
The investigators propose to compare the effects of a 12-week, supervised, site-based group yoga intervention on cognitive function, functional fitness, and well-being in middle-aged cancer survivors. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three exercise conditions: a yoga group, an aerobic walking group or a strength training group. All sessions (2-3 times per week) will be led by a trained exercise leader for a total of 150 minutes of exercise each week for the 12-week intervention.

Cognitive Function, Participants will complete part of the NIH Toolbox measures that assess cognitive function., Change from baseline to 12 weeks will be reported
Cardiovascular Function, Participants will complete a submaximal exercise test to reach a target heart rate within 85% of the age-predicted maximum., Change from baseline to 12 weeks will be reported
Feasibility: Recruitment and retention rates, Proportion of participants randomized relative to total contacts, Proportion of participants who complete follow-up questionnaires,, Baseline to 12-weeks
