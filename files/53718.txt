A Study of Diarrhea and Intestinal Flora Changes Caused by Pyrotinib in Breast Cancer
By measuring the intestinal flora abundance and bacterial count of patients in the early stage of using pyrotinib to clarify the relationship between diarrhea caused by pyrotinib and changes in intestinal flora in breast cancer patients, the correlation between the change of intestinal flora and the relief of diarrhea are also explored after two-cycle treatment.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib
The quantity of intestinal flora from breast cancer patients' fecal microflora at different follow-up nodes, Fecal samples were collected from patients at each follow-up node to detect the number of bacterial species in the intestinal flora, January 2021- December 2022|The abundance of intestinal flora from breast cancer patients' fecal microflora at different follow-up nodes, Fecal samples were collected at each follow-up node to detect the richness of different bacterial species in intestinal flora, January 2021- December 2022
Disease Control Rate（DCR）, DCR=CR+PR+SD Complete Remission(CR): All target lesions disappeared, no new lesions appeared, and tumor markers were normal, for at least 4 weeks; Partial Remission(PR): The sum of the maximum diameter of the target lesion is reduced by ≥30% and maintained for at least 4 weeks; Stable Disease(SD): The maximum diameter and reduction of the target lesion did not reach the PR, or the enlargement did not reach the PD;, January 2021- December 2022|Overall Survival（OS）, Time interval from randomization to death for any reason, January 2021- December 2022|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time interval from randomization to first disease progression or death for any reason, January 2021- December 2022|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR=CR+PR Complete Remission(CR): All target lesions disappeared, no new lesions appeared, and tumor markers were normal, for at least 4 weeks; Partial Remission(PR): The sum of the maximum diameter of the target lesion is reduced by ≥30% and maintained for at least 4 weeks;, January 2021- December 2022
In recent years, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have achieved good results in anti-HER2 therapy and have been widely used in clinical practice, such as Breast cancer. However, such drugs can easily cause diarrhea and disorders of intestinal flora , may affect the efficacy of the drug and lead to the occurrence of other diseases.This study is to clarify the connection between the diarrhea caused by pyrotinib and the change of intestinal flora, pave the way for studying on whether the flora affects the efficacy of the drug and whether the flora should be supplemented appropriately in the future.
