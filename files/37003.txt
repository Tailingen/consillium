Vaginal Fluid Collection for Detection of Endometrial Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to obtain de-identified vaginal fluid specimens from participants with an endometrial tissue biopsy-based histopathological diagnosis of endometrial cancer (EC), endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) with atypia or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN).

The samples will be used for the purpose of research and development of a new molecular diagnostic test for the detection of EC, AEH and EIN.
Endometrial Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Screening test to detect endometrial cancer and precancer
Detection of endometrial cancer and precancer, To provide vaginal fluid specimens to Exact Sciences Corporation to allow for additional research and development of a screening device for the detection of endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia with atypia., 4 months
For participants providing written informed consent to participate in the study, samples of vaginal fluid will be obtained by the Principal Investigator (PI) during a pelvic examination. All vaginal fluid samples will be collected ≥7 days after the endometrial biopsy and prior to initiating any therapeutic interventions including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or hormonal therapy PIs will be provided with multiple, individually packaged Copan eNat® sterile sample collection kits including a swab and a transport tube containing a stabilizer and preservative medium as well as a pre-addressed shipping container and single-use tubes of sterile saline solution After vaginal fluid sample collection, the swab will be inserted into the tube for storage and subsequent shipping to the Sponsor's designated laboratory. The samples can be stored at ambient temperature and should be shipped to the designated laboratory within 24 hours of collection. Site(s) will provide the Sponsor with de-identified endometrial biopsy histopathology report and post-surgery histopathology report (if any) confirming the histopathological diagnosis of EC, AEH or EIN. The final diagnosis will be based on the most severe clinical histopathology (at diagnostic endometrial sampling or surgery.)
