Efficacy and Safety of Pyrotinib Maleate Combined With ARX788 Neoadjuvant Treatment in Breast Cancer Patients
Next-generation Site-specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) is an antibody-conjugated drug. Results from the phase I safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of ARX788 single drug in Chinese patients with advanced HER2 breast cancer indicated a good safety of the test drug, and responses to anti-tumor therapy were observed in the target dose group. Phase II clinical trial is being carried out gradually. This trial is designed to observe the effectiveness and safety of pyrotinib maleate combined with ARX788 neoadjuvant treatment in stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients experiencing a poor efficacy of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Residual tumor burden (RCB) classification in grades, Postoperative pathological results will be used to assess the residual tumor area of primary breast tumor (area in mm×mm), the cell density of the residual tumor（cell density in percentages）, the proportion of carcinoma in situ (proportion of carcinoma in percentages), the number of positive lymph nodes and the diameter of largest metastasis with residual nodes (diameter in mm). The RCB class can be estimated from the above five pathological parameters through a network calculation: RCB-0 in grades: pCR; RCB-I in grades: minimal residual tumor; RCB-II: moderate residual tumor; RCB-III in grades: extensive residual tumor., At least 3 years since enrollment
Best overall response rate (BORR) in percentage, The proportion of patients who achieve remission at any point during the study., At least 3 years since enrollment|Total pathological complete response rate (tpCR) in percentage, The standard for removal of breast and lymph node tumors which means there are no infiltrating cancer cells at the primary breast and axillary lymph nodes, and only intraductal cancer is allowed on the breast., At least 3 years since enrollment|Total breast pathological complete remission rate (bpCR) in percentage, The standard for breast and lymph node tumor removal which means that there are only infiltrating cancer cells at the primary breast tumor site., At least 3 years since enrollment|Disease-free survival (DFS), the time from the day of enrollment to the first occurrence of recurrent disease, including second primary malignancies in the non-breast area and breast ductal carcinoma in situ., At least 3 years since enrollment|Overall survival (OS), the time from the random date to death due to any cause., At least 3 years since enrollment
Adverse events (AE), Adverse events (AE) will be assessed as per the NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard., at least 3 years since enrollment
This study adopts a single-arm, multi-center, open design. As per the initial plan, 30 stage II-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy containing trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have been assessed as stable disease (SD) during the neoadjuvant treatment (an increase of 0-20%), disease progression (PD), inoperable or failing to meet the breast-conserving requirements will be enrolled to receive pyrotinib combined with Next-generation Site-specific HER2-targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) neoadjuvant therapy. The main purpose of the study is to observe the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with ARX788 neoadjuvant treatment in stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer.
