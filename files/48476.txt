PSMA Guided Approach for bIoCHEmical Relapse After Prostatectomy-PSICHE
This observational study was designed to evaluate progression free survival after PSMA-PET/CT based salvage approach for patients affected by biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.

This is a prospective observational multicenter study including patients treated with upfront radical prostatectomy +/- postoperative prostate bed radiotherapy, with histological result of Prostate adenocarcinoma, affected by biochemical relapse (defined as PSA\>/= 0.2 ng/ml) with a PSA at recurrence \</=1 ng/ml. Patients will be staged with centralized 68 Ga- PSMA PET/CT and treated with a pre-defined approach based on 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings.

The predefined approach will consist in the following flowchart:

1. In negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT or positive findings within prostate bed: Prostate bed RT
2. In 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT detecting pelvic nodal recurrence amenable with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on all sites of disease: SBRT to all positive nodal disease.
3. In abdominal nodal or bone oligometastatic disease amenable with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on all sites of disease: SBRT on all sites of disease
4. In abdominal nodal or bone metastatic disease (\>3 lesions or non-amenable with SBRT) and/or visceral disease: ADT+/-other systemic therapies available for metastatic hormone sensitive pCa at physician discretion.
