Breast Cancer
DRUG: Endostar|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From enrollment to disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 100 months
Overall Survival (OS), From enrollment to death due to any cause, up to approximately 100 months|Objective Response Rate (ORRï¼‰, Ratio of CR and PR in all subjects, up to approximately 100 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Ratio of CR,PR and SD more than or equal to 24 weeks, up to approximately 100 months|Adverse events (AEs), Described in terms of CTC AE 4.0, from enrollment to 30 days after the last dose administration
This is a multi-center phase II open label single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of endostar in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locoregionally recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer.

Endostar is an anti-angiogenesis drug. It is prepared by adding 9 amino acids to the N-terminal of the peptide chain on the basis of endostatin. Studies have shown that there may be a synergistic effect between endostar and chemotherapeutic agents.
