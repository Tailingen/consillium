Keratinocyte Skin Cancer Surgery in the Elderly, Aged 80 Years and Over, is Effective and Safe
As a result of a longer life expectancy and a change in UV exposure, physicians will be facing a growing number of elderly patients with keratinocyte cancer (KC) in fair-skinned populations. The purpose of this study is to better characterize KC surgery in patients over 80 years and older with different comorbid conditions and to investigate the incidence of complications associated with KC surgery.

A retrospective monocentric study of patients aged 80 and older, having surgery for KC in University Hospital of Zurich between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, was conducted. Demographics, comorbidities, current medication, treatment type, tumor characteristics, surgical defect size, repair type and complications within 6 months after surgery were analyzed.
