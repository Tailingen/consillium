Effect of Spironolactone in the Prevention of Anthracycline-induced Cardiotoxicity (SPIROTOX)
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of spironolactone in the primary prevention of cardiotoxicity in cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy with anthracycline within 12 months. The main question it aims to answer is:

• Does spironolactone reduce the incidence of cardiotoxicity in patients undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy?

Participants will:

* Be cancer patients over 18 years starting treatment with anthracycline;
* Be randomized to receive either spironolactone or a placebo for 1 year;
* Undergo assessments of their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain, and cardiac biomarkers over the 12-month period.

Researchers will compare the spironolactone group to the placebo group to see if cardiotoxicity incidence differs between the two.

Cardiotoxicity, Incidence of cardiotoxicity, defined as:

* A decrease in ejection fraction (LVEF) by 10% or more to LVEF \< 50%, as seen on transthoracic echocardiogram; OR
* Relative drop in global longitudinal strain greater than 15% compared to baseline, observed on transthoracic echocardiogram; OR
* New increase in cardiac biomarkers (troponin T \> 99th percentile and/or NT-proBNP \> 125 pg/mL)., 12 months

Quality of life measured by EQ-5D-3L (EuroQol 5 Dimension 3 Level) questionnaire, The EQ-5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression, using 3 levels; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicate worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state., 3, 6 and 12 months|Medication adherence, Medication adherence rate measured by the Morisky-Green index, 3, 6 and 12 months|Oncological Treatment Discontinuation Rate, 12 months|Tumor Recurrence, 12 months|Hospitalization Rate, 12 months|Mortality Rate, 12 months
Objective:

To assess the potential of spironolactone in preventing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity among cancer patients.

Background:

There's ongoing debate and a dearth of evidence regarding the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone, in averting anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

Study Design:

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at a single center.

Sample Size:

264 patients.

Intervention:

Eligible participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either receive spironolactone or a placebo over a 12-month period.

Primary Outcome:

Incidence of cardiotoxicity at the 12-month mark.
