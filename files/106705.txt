Study of LM-299 in Subjects Advanced Malignant Tumors
For Phase I Dose Escalation Stage, to assess the safety and tolerability of LM-299 in patients with advanced solid tumors,determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD), and explorethe recommended dose for expansion (RDE) in patients with advanced solid tumours..

For Phase II Dose Expansion Stage, to assess the antitumor activity of LM-299 in patients with various advanced solid tumors.
