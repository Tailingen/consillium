Study of TTC-352 in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing on Endocrine Therapy
Phase1 study of TTC 352 for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer.
Metastatic ER+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: TTC-352
MTD, The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy, 24 months
Best response to treatment, Determine patient best response to treatment (complete response, partial response, stable disease or disease progression) after at least two 28-day cycles of treatment with TTC 352., 24 months|PFS, Determine durations of progression-free survival after at least two 28-day cycles of treatment with TTC 352, 24 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 will be collected in presented in tabular form at the end of study., 24 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Blood samples will be collected at the following Cycle 1 time points:

Day 1: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 after dosing (just before dosing on Day 2).

Day 28: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 28 after dosing.

TTC-352 blood levels will be measured at above time points and Cmax will be calculated., 24 months|Half life, Blood samples will be collected at the following Cycle 1 time points:

Day 1: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 after dosing (just before dosing on Day 2).

Day 28: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 28 after dosing.

TTC-352 blood levels will be measured at above time points and half life of TTC-352 will be calculated., 24 months|Area Under the Curve (AUC), Blood samples will be collected at the following Cycle 1 time points:

Day 1: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 after dosing (just before dosing on Day 2).

Day 28: prior to dosing and at Hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 28 after dosing.

TTC-352 blood levels will be measured at above time points and AUC will be calculated., 24 months
This is open-label, accelerated dose escalation study of TTC 352, a selective human ER partial agonist for treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer in patients who received and progressed on at least two lines of endocrine therapy with one that included a CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy.

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TTC-352 will be determined using initial single-patient cohort escalations until grade 2 toxicity, then expansion to a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design. Patients enrolled at each dose escalation step must complete the first 28-day cycle of treatment without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), or be withdrawn because of a DLT, before additional patients may be enrolled for the next dose escalation step. The MTD dose level cohort will be expanded to a total of 9 patients, to further evaluate safety. In each cohort pharmacokinetics of TTC-352 will be evaluated.
