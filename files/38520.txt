mil60 Versus Bevacizumab in Patients With Treatment-na√Øve Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase 3 study is aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of mil60 with bevacizumab as first-line treatment when combined with standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in treatment-naive patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.

This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of mil60 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC.The primary objective of the study was to compare the Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 of mil60 in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin and bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the treatment of advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC subjects.
