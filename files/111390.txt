Phase I/II Study of Oral S-1 Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
To assess the usefulness of Gemcitabine plus S-1 therapy based on the antitumor effect and survival period. By performing a phase I/II study of this combination in patients with inoperable or with postoperative pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: S-1
Determine the DLT(Dose Limiting Toxicity) and MTD(Maximum Tolerated Dose) in Phase I setting.|Determine the clinical response rate with Recommended dose in Phase II setting.
Determine the clinical response rate of patients in Phase I setting.|Determine the MST(Median Survival Time) and DFS(Disease Free Survival) in Phase II setting.
A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is conducted on patients with histological stage IV Pancreatic cancer given gemcitabine plus S-1. The usefulness of this regimens as 1st line therapy for pancreatic cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival(DFS), median survival time (MST), incidence and severity of adverse event.
