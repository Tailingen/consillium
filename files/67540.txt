A Study of the Treatment of Disitamab Vedotin in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase 2 clinical study,to explore the efficacy and safety of Disitamab Vedotin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer expressing HER2.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Object Response Rate, ORR, Defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), up to 12 months
Disease Control Rate, DCR, Defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or standard disease (SD) as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1, up to 12 months|Progress Free Survival, PFS, Defined as time from randomization until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, or death due to any cause., up to 12 months|Over Survival, OS, Defined as time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., up to 12 months|Adverse Events (AE), NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 12 months
63 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer will participate in this study. HER2 expression in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients is defined as the expression of HER2 in tumor tissues detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+. The arm 1 recruits 43 patients and the arm 2 recruits 20 patients.
