To determine MTD, 6 evaluable participants are required., From first dosing at cycle 0 to the end of cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia: Assessment of safety and toxicity profile, Number of participants who experienced AEs, SAEs, and changes in physical examination, vital signs, ECOG score, imaging examination, laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram, etc., From enrollment until the 28 days after the last study dose.|Phase Ib: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose tumors have achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) after treatment, with response confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first assessment of CR or PR., From enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).
Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Terminal Phase Half-life (t1/2 ), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Time to reach Cmax (tmax), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Area Under the Curve (AUC), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Apparent Clearance Rate (CL/F), Evaluate drug concentration-time data by individual subject for single or repeated dosing of CSCJC3456., From enrollment to the end of cycle 1, phase Ia includes cycles 0 and 1, while phase Ib includes cycle 1. Cycle 0 has 7 days, and cycle 1 has 28 days.|Phase Ia: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose tumors achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment., From enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants whose tumors achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) after treatment., From enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Durable objective response (DOR), DOR is defined as the period from the start of objective response recorded to the first occurrence of tumor progression or death due to any cause., From enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Phase Ia and Phase Ib: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time period from the initiation of treatment to the occurrence of tumor progression or death due to any cause., From enrollment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Phase Ib: Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to death due to any cause., From enrollment to the date of death due to any cause (up to approximately 2 years).|Phase Ib: Assessment of safety and toxicity profile, Number of participants who experienced AEs, SAEs, and changes in physical examination, vital signs, ECOG score, imaging examination, laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram, etc., From enrollment until the 28 days after the last study dose.
CSCJC3456 is a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and this is the first-in-human trial of CSCJC3456. This study adopts an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, dose-escalation, and cohort expansion research design, and is divided into two parts, Phase Ia and Phase Ib.

Phase Ia is a single and multiple dose escalation trial with an open-label design, aiming to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD characteristics of CSCJC3456 tablets, preliminarily assess the anti-tumor efficacy, and recommend the dose for Phase Ib study.

Phase Ib is a single-arm cohort expansion study conducted in participants with four target solid tumors, based on the recommended dosage and dosing cycle from the Phase Ia study. The actual tumor types for the Phase Ib study will be adjusted according to the safety and efficacy data from the Phase Ia study.
