mFOCUS (Multilevel FOllow-up of Cancer Screening)
To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, team and individual components of mFOCUS vs. standard care by conducting a 4-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of individuals who are due for follow-up of an abnormal cancer screening test.
Cancer
OTHER: mFOCUS
Completion of Follow-up Test, Completion of follow-up test within 120 days of eligibility for mFOCUS (EHR), 120 days
Number of Participants Who Complete the Required Diagnostic Evaluation, How many participants completed the required diagnostic evaluation (EHR), 0-60, 61-120, 121-180, 181-240 day intervals were evaluated., up to 240 days
Standard care consists of well-characterized existing decision support and systems for follow-up in these three participating primary care networks and their affiliated integrated delivery systems (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dartmouth Hitchcock Health, the largest health care provider in New Hampshire). The primary outcome will be whether an individual receives follow-up, defined based on the type of screening abnormality and organ type (breast, cervical, lung or colorectal cancer), within 120 days of becoming eligible for mFOCUS. Secondary comparisons will assess multi- and cross-level (individual, team, system) outcomes. The study design will allow us to examine the marginal effectiveness of system, team and individual-level enhancements, and exploratory analyses will address subgroups defined by race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status and cancer type.
