PIK3CA Mutational Status Assessment
Evaluation of PIK3CA mutational status: a route towards a tailored diagnostic approach.
Breast Cancer Metastatic
Evaluation of PIK3CA mutational status: a path towards a "tailored" diagnostic approach., Investigate concordance between sequencing panels again generation (NGS) based on different principles and different RT-PCR assays in detecting mutations of PIK3CA., 2 years
Evaluate the effectiveness and concordance of molecular methods in identifying mutations affecting the PIK3CA gene both on paraffin tissue sections of the tumor and on liquid biopsy of patients with breast cancer treated at the IEO. The molecular test on the liquid biopsy of same patient could bring an important benefit considering that the withdrawal of this biomaterial turns out to be less invasive than a biopsy performed on an organ
