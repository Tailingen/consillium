GT90001 Plus Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a global phase II, open label study in the subjects with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (aHCC) who were intolerant or had progressed after or intolerant to first-line Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) such as Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab, or ICI plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).

Based on published and first-hand experience with the safety and tolerability of both GT90001 and Nivolumab, the proposed dose is GT90001 7 mg/kg in combination with Nivolumab 240 mg, infusion every two weeks.

This study will enroll a total of 105 subjects to receive combinational therapy of Nivolumab and GT90001.

• Nivolumab 240 mg will first be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes, then 30 minutes later, give intravenous infusion of GT90001 7.0 mg/kg over 60 min, once every two weeks.
