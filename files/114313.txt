Bortezomib, Isatuximab, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone Induction in Transplant-Eligible Multiple Myeloma Patients With Renal Insufficiency
This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study with a safety lead-in phase.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Isatuximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
The number of subjects who achieve very good partial response., This will be measured using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria., 100 days following autologous stem cell transplant
The number of subjects who achieve complete response., This will be measured using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria., 100 days following autologous stem cell transplant.|The number of subjects who achieve partial response., This will be measured using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria., 100 days following autologous stem cell transplant.
The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab plus bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (VCD) combination is safe and highly effective even in those with renal insufficiency (RI) from myeloma. In this study, we seek to improve the efficacy of VCD by adding isatuximab in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of renal function.

The primary objective is to determine if the addition of isatuximab to VCD will increase the proportion of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and by the time of completion of post-ASCT consolidation treatment.
