The Effect of Switching the H1-antagonist Clemastine to Cetirizine in Premedication Regimens During Paclitaxel Treatment
In this study the effect of substituting clemastine IV to cetirizine PO on the occurence of hypersensitivity reactions during paclitaxel chemotherapy will be investigated.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Cetirizine|DRUG: Clemastine IV
Clinically relevant hypersensitivity reactions, Hypersensitivity reactions grade 3 or higher according to CTCAE v4.03, During the first six cycles of paclitaxel treatment (the length of one cycle of paclitaxel treatment varies but is typically 7-21 days, depending on standard of care protocol).
Hypersensitivity reactions, Hypersensitivity reactions any grade according to CTCAE v4.03, During the first six cycles of paclitaxel treatment (the length of one cycle of paclitaxel treatment varies but is typically 7-21 days, depending on standard of care protocol).|The difference in the number of paclitaxel dosages until first occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions, The difference in the number of paclitaxel dosages until first the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions between the arms will be described., During the first six cycles of paclitaxel treatment (the length of one cycle of paclitaxel treatment varies but is typically 7-21 days, depending on standard of care protocol).|The cumulative dose of paclitaxel (mg/m2) administered prior to the moment of hypersensitivity reaction, The cumulative dose of paclitaxel (mg/m2) administered prior to the moment of occurrence of hypersensitivity reaction, During the first six cycles of paclitaxel treatment (the length of one cycle of paclitaxel treatment varies but is typically 7-21 days, depending on standard of care protocol).
This is a single arm before-after study with a historic control cohort to evaluate the effect of a policy change (i.e. substitution of clemastine IV for cetirizine PO) regarding the premedication scheme on the incidence of HSR during paclitaxel based chemotherapy.
