iCare 2: Personalized Genomic Mutation Informed Treatment of Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This open-label, randomized, parallel group phase II study will investigate the efficacy of computational biology-informed treatment vs. standard of care treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: FDA-approved drug or combination of drugs|DRUG: FLAG induction|DRUG: 7 + 3 induction|DRUG: Low-dose cytarabine|OTHER: Supportive care alone|DEVICE: Computational biology simulations software
Difference in overall response, as measured by International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria for response in MDS, Difference in overall response (number of patients who achieve complete response, partial response, stable disease, or hematologic improvement per IWG 2006 criteria) between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy vs. those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months
Difference in safety and feasibility, as measured by CTCAE v4.0 criteria, Difference in safety and feasibility, as measured by CTCAE v4.0 criteria, between patients treated with computational biology-informed treatment and those who receive a standard of care regimen, 5 months|Difference in time to death between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 3 years|Difference in time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as measured by IWG 2006 criteria for response in MDS, between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months|Difference in time to disease relapse, as measured by IWG 2006 criteria for response in MDS, between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months|Difference in time to best response, as measured by IWG 2006 criteria for response in MDS, between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months|Difference in change in myeloblast percentage between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months|Difference in blood transfusion rate between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 7 months
Differences in mutant allele frequencies between patients treated with computational biology-informed therapy and those treated with standard of care regimens, 4 months|Laboratory correlations between computational model and actual intracellular pathway activation status, 4 months|Clinical correlations between pharmacogenotypes and drug efficacy (as measured by IWG 2006 criteria for response in MDS), 4 months|Clinical correlations between pharmacogenotypes and drug-related adverse events (as measured by CTCAE v4.0 criteria), 5 months
It is hypothesized that personalized treatment informed by computational biology simulation technology will improve treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory MDS.
