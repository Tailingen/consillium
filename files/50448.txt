A Prospective Longitudinal Study to Identify Biomarkers in Children With Hemangiomas
Current treatment options for hemangiomas, such as propranolol, steroids and interferon, all have the potential for significantly harmful side effects. The purpose of this study is to identify potential biomarkers that can be used to design clinical trials and accelerate the delivery of new treatment alternatives to children with hemangiomas.
Hemangioma
PROCEDURE: Urine collection and ultrasonography|PROCEDURE: Urine collection
Chemically modified DNA, Determine whether changes in urinary 8-OHdG can be used as biomarkers for HE growth and involution., 6 months
Blood flow velocity, Obtain Doppler ultrasound measurements of HE blood flow velocity and size on the same days as serum and urine specimen collection to determine whether changes in blood flow velocity and size correlate with changes in 8-OHdG production., 6 months
Urine will be collected from children with hemangiomas and age-matched healthy controls at 2,4,6,9,12,18 and 24 months of age. Children with hemangiomas will also have ultrasound examination performed at each visit.
