Microtransplantation for Advanced and Relapsed Solid Tumors
In this study, we will apply micro transplantation to the field of solid tumors to study the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with micro transplantation in the treatment of advanced / relapsed solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: microtransplantation, HLA-mismatched donor peripheral stem cell infusion
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment related mortality, 1 month|time of hematopoietic recovery, Absolute neutrophil count \>500/mcL; Platelets ≥20,000/mcL, 1 month
overall response rate, (markedly effective + effective) / number of patients × 100%, 1year
The eligible patients are assigned to the experimental group (microtransplantation group, MST group) or the control group (CT) according to the availability of suitable donors. In MST group, peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells from HLA mismatched donors mobilized with granulocyte colony stimulating factor are infused after conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy ; The CT group only received conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. According to the patient's past medical history, current tumor assessment results, and the latest cancer treatment guidelines, the individualized chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy plan for the patient is formulated after discussion by more than 3 oncologists. After each course of treatment, the efficacy and safety are evaluated. For the patients who are evaluated to be effective or stable (SD) after the first treatment, the second treatment of the same scheme will be given. Those who reach the disease control level will continue to be treated for 4 courses, with an interval of 28 days. The patients who failed to achieve the improvement of SD after two cycles of chemotherapy will be withdrawn from the study. Patients are allowed to receive any treatment, including symptomatic support treatment, after the end of treatment or withdrawal from the study.
