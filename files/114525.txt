A Study of Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) in People With Lung Adenocarcinoma
The researchers are doing this study to find out if treatment with TTFields using the NovoTTF-200T System is safe and practical (feasible) before surgical removal (resection) of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). The researchers will also look at how the treatment may help the body's immune system to fight cancer.
