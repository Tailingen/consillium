A Plant-Based Whole-Foods Meal Delivery Service for Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
This clinical trial evaluates the impact of a plant-based whole-foods delivery service on the microbiome in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant. An autologous hematopoietic cell transplant is a procedure in which blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) are removed, stored, and later given back to the same person. Loss of microbial diversity within the intestinal tract has been associated with poor outcomes for patients receiving autologous stem cell transplantation. A plant-based whole meal delivery service may increase the intake of foods high in fiber and nutrients therefore improve microbial health during the peri-transplant period. In this pilot study, study investigators will explore the feasibility of this approach.

Enrollment rate, The proportion of eligible patients who consent to enroll in the study will be computed based on the number approached and estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Reasons for non-participation will be summarized., Up to 1 year|Collection rate, Collection rate will be the percentage of stool samples, blood samples and surveys collected., Up to 1 month post transplant|Tolerability of the delivered diet: Patient opinion, Patient opinion of the delivered meals will be assessed using qualitative end-study surveys., Up to 1 month post transplant|Tolerability of the delivered diet: Proportion of meals consumed, Patient acceptability of the delivered meals will be assessed using proportions of the delivered meals consumed based on multi-day food diaries and 24-hour recall assessments., Up to 1 month post transplant
OUTLINE:

Patients receive 3 meals per day and snacks delivered twice weekly and meet with dietitian once weekly on days -7 to 28. Patients undergo blood and stool sample collection on study.
