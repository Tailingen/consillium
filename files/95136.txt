Active Symptom Monitoring in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Thoracic Malignancies
This study seeks to achieve two aims:

* To assess the implementation of Noona software for continuous symptom monitoring for a diverse population of patients with thoracic malignancies who are undergoing radiation and
* To validate remote collection of standardized PRO measures using Noona software.

Patient reported outcomes as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Patients respond on a four-point scale from "not at all" to "very much" for most items. Most items use a "past week" recall period. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden., Baseline, within 1 week of completing therapy and at 90-day follow-up|Patient reported outcomes as measured by NCCN Distress Thermometer, Measures distress experienced during the past week. 10 = extreme distress and 0=no distress, Baseline, within 1 week of completing therapy and at 90-day follow-up
