Basket Study of Leronlimab (PRO 140) in Patients With CCR5+ Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a single arm phase II study with 30 patients of leronlimab (PRO 140) in patients with CCR5+ locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Leronlimab (PRO 140) will be administered subcutaneously as weekly dose of 525 mg until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Subjects participating in this study will be allowed to receive/continue standard-of-care chemotherapy or radotherapy as per the dosing schedule included on the package insert.

In this study, patients will be evaluated for tumor response approximately every 3 months or according to institution's standard practice by CT, PET/CT or MRI with contrast (per treating investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: Leronlimab
Number, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs), Note: Adverse events will follow National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, From the time of first treatment until 12 weeks after study treatment completion|Incidence of abnormal laboratory tests results, Up to 12 weeks after study treatment completion|Changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status from baseline to subsequent scheduled visits, Up to 12 weeks after study treatment completion
Progression free survival (PFS) defined as time in months from the date of first study treatment to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Note: All patients who receive at least one dose of leronlimab will be included in the primary analyses of PFS. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria will be used for objective tumor response assessment (when disease is measurable and non- measurable);, The time in months from start of treatment to progression or death will be measured for all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be followed up to 2 years after completion of treatment.|Overall response rate (ORR, defined as CR + PR) in subjects with CCR5+ locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with leronlimab, Note: Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve an overall response of complete response or partial response in the total number of evaluable patients, assessed by RECIST v1.1. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve an overall response of complete response or partial response or stable disease in the total number of evaluable patients, assessed by RECIST v1.1., The time in months from start of treatment to progression or death will be measured for all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be followed up to 2 years after completion of treatment.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR, defined as CR + PR + SD) in subjects with CCR5+ locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors treated with leronlimab, Note: Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve an overall response of complete response or partial response in the total number of evaluable patients, assessed by RECIST v1.1. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve an overall response of complete response or partial response or stable disease in the total number of evaluable patients, assessed by RECIST v1.1., The time in months from start of treatment to progression or death will be measured for all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be followed up to 2 years after completion of treatment.|Time to new metastases (TTNM), Note: Recorded time from baseline metastatic disease (at time of enrollment) to the time of development of new metastasis in different site, assessed up to 6 months. New metastases in same site will be also recorded., The time in months from start of treatment to progression or death will be measured for all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug.|The change from baseline in circulating tumor cells (CTC) level in the peripheral blood., Note: Reported unit of measure will be the number of CTCs/milliliter. CTCs enumeration will be performed at baseline and at the time of response assessment, assessed up to 6 months. Fraction of baseline positive and change from â‰¥5 CTCs will be recorded and reported, From date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first.|Overall survival defined as time in months from the date of first study treatment to the date of death, Note: Patients will be followed from the start of treatment until 2 years post-treatment or death, whichever occurs first, and average survival time will be measured., The time in months from start of treatment to progression or death will be measured for all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be followed up to 2 years after completion of treatment.
