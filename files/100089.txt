Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor and Thymalfasin for pMMR/MSS Locally Advanced Mid-low Rectal Cancer
This is an open, prospective, multi-center, single-arm phase II clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor and thymalfasin in patients with pMMR/MSS locally advanced middle and low rectal cancer.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: tislelizumab|DRUG: thymalfasin|RADIATION: long-term radiotherapy
CR rate, complete response rate, If patients achieved cCR after neoadjuvant therapy or were confirmed pCR after TME, they were considered as complete response (CR). pCR was defined as no residual tumor cells on the histologic examination of surgical specimens according to AJCC 8th edition. cCR was defined according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) standard., from preoperative to 10 days postoperative
TRAE, incidence of treatment-related adverse event, from commencing of treatment to the 30th day after surgery|30-day incidence of postoperative complications, incidence of surgical complications within 30 days after surgery, within 30 days after surgery|ORR, objective response rate; The ORR rate is the result of complete response (CR) rate plus partial response (PR) rate., before surgery|3-y DFS rate, 3-year disease free survival rate, 3 years|NAR score, neoadjuvant rectal score, within 10 days after surgery|R0 resection rate, rate of R0 resection, within 10 days after surgery|anal preservation rate, proportion of patients with preserved anal sphincter, instantly after surgery
The expression of CD68, The density, H-score of each marker in paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected by mIHC, up to 3 months after surgery|The expression of CD86, The density, H-score of each marker in paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected by mIHC, up to 3 months after surgery|The expression of CD163, The density, H-score of each marker in paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected by mIHC, up to 3 months after surgery|The expression of CD4, The density, H-score of each marker in paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected by mIHC, up to 3 months after surgery|The expression of CD8, The density, H-score of each marker in paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected by mIHC, up to 3 months after surgery
This study is an open, prospective, multi-center, single-arm phase II clinical study. In this study, patients with pMMR/MSS locally advanced middle and low rectal cancer were selected as the subjects and treated with neoadjuvant treatment protocol of long-course concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and thymalfasin. The primary endpoint of the study was complete response (CR) rate. The secondary end points included treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) rate, 30-day incidence of postoperative complications, objective response rate (ORR), 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, Neoadjuvant rectal cancer (NAR) score, R0 resection rate, and anal preservation rate.
