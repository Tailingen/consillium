Chemoembolization With or Without Mixing the Chemotherapy With Lipiodol for Unresectable HCC
TACE is considered the standard treatment for unresectable HCC on the basis of the fact that there are no alternative to curative procedures.But the optimal combined regimen is still unclear. One of the controversy is do the protocol should contain lipiodo and how to executer. The investigators hypothesize that TACE without mixing the chemotherapy with lipiodol is not unacceptably worse than TACE mixing the chemotherapy with lipiodol.
