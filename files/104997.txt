DRUG: Sodium cridanimod
Objective Response Rate, 12 months

Progesterone receptor (PrR) levels, 1 months
This is an open label, multi-center, single arm phase II study. The study will investigate the efficacy of sodium cridanimod in conjunction with progestin therapy in a population of patients with recurrent or persistent PrR-negative endometrial cancer.

Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and administered sodium cridanimod in combination progestin therapy. Objective responses will be assessed at 12 week intervals. Patients will be treated for a 12 month period, followed by an additional 12 month follow up period or to disease progression whichever occurs first.

Important objectives of the study are to investigate the effect of sodium cridanimod in conjunction with progestin therapy on the level of PrR in tumor tissue and how this correlates to efficacy. To accomplish this objective, some of the patients enrolled in the study will undergo two tumor biopsies that will allow measurement of PrR levels in the tumor tissue before the treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy.
