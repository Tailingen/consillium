Double Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Collagenase Histolyticum in the Treatment of Lipoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether collagenase is effective in reducing the surface area of a subcutaneous benign lipoma.
Lipoma
DRUG: AA4500|DRUG: placebo
Percent Change From Baseline in Surface Area of the Lipoma at Six Months, The primary efficacy outcome is lipoma visible surface area defined as the longest dimension ("length") times the longest dimension perpendicular to length ("width"). Visible surface area will be analyzed as the percent change from baseline at the 6-month visit., Baseline and 6 months post injection
Responder Analysis, The number of participants with at least 50% decrease in visible lipoma surface area of lipoma relative to baseline, Baseline and 6 months|Percent Change From Baseline in Greatest Dimension (Length) of Lipoma at 6 Months, Change from baseline in lipoma length Calculated as the percent change from baseline for length of the lipoma treated with AA4500 and the lipoma treated with placebo., Baseline and 6 months|Subject Satisfaction, Subjects very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with study treatment based upon Subject Questionnaire, 6 months
Change in Visible Surface Area, Visible surface area is defined as the longest dimension ("length") times the longest dimension perpendicular to length ("width"). Visible surface area will be analyzed as the percent change from baseline., 1 Month post injection|Change in Visible Surface Area, Visible surface area is defined as the longest dimension ("length") times the longest dimension perpendicular to length ("width"). Visible surface area will be analyzed as the percent change from baseline., 3 month post injection
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug (XIAFLEX) in the treatment of lipoma (fatty tumors). The fat in the lipoma is like normal fat except that it is enclosed in a balloon-like structure which is made of collagen (fibrous tissue). Treatment of the lipoma with an injection of XIAFLEX (a protein that breaks down collagen fibers) may dissolve the collagen/fibrous strands thereby decreasing the size of the lipoma or removing it. Each subject must have two lipomas; one lipoma to be treated with placebo and one lipoma to be treated with study drug, both to be observed similarly throughout the trial.
