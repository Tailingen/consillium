Neoadjuvant Chemo-endocrine Therapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in ER-positive, HER2-negative Breast Cancer
This was an open-label, randomized controlled trial that aims to compare the efficacy and safety of the concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

Data showed that concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with endocrine therapy was a effective option for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients. However this is still a controversial issue. The present study is an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial that aims to investigate the efficacy of concurrent NCT with endocrine therapy (AI with or without GnRH-a) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast carcinoma.
