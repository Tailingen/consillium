Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Donor-derived CD19 CAR Therapy Bridged Allo-HSCT and Sequential Donor-derived CD22 CAR Therapy for r/r B-ALL: a Clinical Trial
This is an investigator-initiated, single-arm, open-label, non-randomised phase I clinical study. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of donor-derived CD19 CAR Therapy bridged Allo-HSCT and sequential donor-derived CD22 CAR Therapy for r/r B-ALL and to explore the efficacy of this therapy preliminarily. The primary endpoints are incidence and type of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days (i.e., 43 days after donor-derived CD19 CAR T-cell infusion) after donor-derived CD19 CAR T-cell therapy bridged allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; total number, incidence and severity of adverse events from donor-derived CD19 CAR T cell infusion back to 30 days after donor-derived CD22 CAR T cell infusion (i.e., within 120 days of donor-derived CD19 CAR T cell infusion). The secondary endpoints are total number, incidence and severity of adverse events from 120 days to 2 years after donor-derived CD19 CAR T-cell infusion; ORR(CR+CRi) on days 45, 90, 120; duration of response(DOR), event-free survival(EFS), overall survival(OS); pharmacokinetics characteristics. The trial plan to enroll 3\~12 cases in dose escalation phase and 36 cases in dose expansion phase.
