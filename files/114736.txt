Study of DMXAA (Now Known as ASA404) in Solid Tumors
This is a phase I study aimed at identifying safe doses of DMXAA in patients with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: DMXAA
Toxicity of DMXAA|Maximum tolerated dose of DMXAA|Pharmacokinetics of DMXAA|Effect of DMXAA on coagulation parameters, TNF and other cytokine production, nitric oxide, and serotonin production
Efficacy of DMXAA|Effect of DMXAA on tumor vasculature
This is a dose escalation study conducted at a single center in New Zealand. Patients received dimethylxanthenone acetic acid (DMXAA) IV over 20 minutes once every three weeks, up to a maximum of 12 courses.

Cohorts of 3 patients received escalated doses of DMXAA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

Patients had solid tumors for which there was no standard therapy or were refractory to conventional therapy.
