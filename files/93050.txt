Intratumoral Holmium Microspheres Brachytherapy for Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This is a feasibility study in which patients with pancreatic cancer are treated with intratumoral holmium microsphere injections.
Pancreas Cancer
DEVICE: QuiremSpheres®
Average tumour dose by SPECT imaging, To establish the feasibility of intratumoral implantation of QuiremSpheres® by evaluating the average tumour absorbed dose in Gy calculated on SPECT., At 1 week after intervention
Microsphere distribution by MRI, Microsphere distribution in analysed using MRI to evaluate tumour absorbed and non-target absorbed dose., At 1 week after intervention|Microsphere distribution by CT, Microsphere distribution in analysed using CT to evaluate tumour absorbed and non-target absorbed dose., At 1 week after intervention|Number of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Safety, expressed in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, grade 3 and higher, probably or definitely related to the implantation procedure or medical device implant is monitored up to 3 months after intervention., Up to 3 months after intervention|Tumor response by RECIST 1.1, Tumor response to the intervention is evaluated according to the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 after 3 months., At 3 months after intervention
