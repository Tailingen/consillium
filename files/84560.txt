KN 046 Plus Regorafenib in MSS Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The study is an interventional Phase II clinical trial aiming to optimize immunotherapy strategies for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer. We will include three types of metastatic colorectal cancer patients: those without liver metastasis, or carrying BRAF V600E mutation, or unable to tolerate chemotherapy as their initial or second-line treatment. The participants will receive a combination treatment of regorafenib and KN046 which is a PD-L1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody. Treatment efficacy and safety profile would be evaluated in this study.
