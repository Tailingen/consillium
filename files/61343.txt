A Study Using Tumor-Reactive Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in Metastatic Melanomas
The purpose of this protocol is to determine whether autologous TIL infused in conjunction with systemic high-dose IL-2 after non-myeloablative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can cause consistent and durable objective responses in patients who have metastatic melanoma at the John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI).
Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL)
Clinical Response, At the end of 12 week follow up, the proportion of patients that showed clinical response (CR) determined by the disappearance of all target lesions, or partial response (PR) will be calculated. The patient is determined to have partial response as if 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions are shown from the baseline sum LD., 12 weeks, or until development of new metastases or recurrence
Quality of Life, Quality of Life will be assessed and scored per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) EORTC-QLQ-C30 version 3.0 requirements. The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains subscales for global health status, and physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social function with higher scores indicating better functioning (19). The change in QOL measured throughout the study period will be examined through mixed effect model adjusting for the baseline. Akaike information criteria (AIC) will be used to determine appropriate covariance structure., 12 weeks, or until development of new metastases or recurrence
