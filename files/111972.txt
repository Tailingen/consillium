Phase I Using Velcade & Idarubicin in Elderly and Relapsed AML
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib and idarubicin given in combination to newly diagnosed AML patients \>60 years or relapsed AML patients.

Another purpose of this study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities associated with bortezomib in combination with idarubicin in newly diagnosed AML patients \>60 years or relapsed AML patients.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Idarubicin
Maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib & idarubicin given in combination, with idarubicin given once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks & bortezomib given twice weekly over the same time., week 4|Dose limiting toxicities associated with bortezomib in combination with idarubicin., week 4
Response to the combination of Idarubicin and Bortezomib., Days 18 & 50|Pre- & post-treatment inhibition of NF-kB activity in the malignant & normal hematopoietic cell populations., 24 hours after the initial dose of Bortezomib|Induction of p53 levels in the malignant cell populations., 2 and 24 hours post day +1 Bortezomib|Bortezomib PK when administered to patients with acute leukemia receiving concomitant medications that could lead to drug interactions. In the case of altered pharmacokinetics, a pharmacodynamic assay to check proteasome inhibition may also be applied., Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15|Idarubicin PK in order to observe any alteration in metabolism/elimination of Idarubicin & its active metabolite idarubicinol when it is combined with Bortezomib., Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15
