Targeted Radionuclide Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma [131I] ICF01012
This study is a phase I clinical trial aimed to determine the recommended dose of \[131I\]ICF01012 to administer for the treatment of patients with pigmented metastatic melanoma (binding \[131I\]ICF01012 ). The \[131I\]ICF01012 is a targeted radionuclide therapy with a high affinity for melanin.
Melanoma
DRUG: [131I]ICF01012 (therapeutic dose level 1)|DRUG: [131I]ICF01012 (therapeutic dose level 2)|DRUG: [131I]ICF01012 (therapeutic dose level 3)|DRUG: [131I]ICF01012 (therapeutic dose level 4)
Evaluation of the recommended therapeutic dose of [131I] ICF01012, defined as the highest dose at which the percentage of DLT (dose limiting toxicity) is less than 33%. The DLT is defined as:

* all non hematologic toxicities NCI-CTC grade 3-4 except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting and fever that can be controlled by appropriate measures.
* hematologic toxicities as thrombopenia and anemia of grade 4, neutropenia of grade 4 for more than 5 days, thrombopenia of grade 3 with bleeding and all other hematologic toxicities of grade 3 clinically significant of more than 3 weeks, Only toxicities observed during the 6 weeks following administration of the therapeutic dose will be considered for the evaluation of DLT
Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity by patients and by lesions of [131I]ICF01012 ICF01012 for the visualization of metastatic melanoma lesions from the examinations made during the selection phase, binding of \[131I\]ICF01012 compared to standard evaluation of metastatic lesion (standard imaging (CT Scan, TEP ...) or clinical evaluation), selection phase Day 0 - Day 7|Evaluation of the tolerance of [131I] ICF01012 (adverse events assessed by NCI-CTC Version 4.03), adverse events assessed by NCI-CTC Version 4.03, from the the first dose to the end of study (3 months after diagnostic dose)|Pharmacokinetics of [131I] ICF01012 including the study of biodistribution and excretion (radiation counting of serum, whole blood and urinary samples), radiation counting of serum, whole blood and urinary samples, selection phase Day 0 (diagnostic dose), Day 1, and Day 4, Day 7|Evaluation of the therapeutic response of [131I] ICF01012., Response will be categorized according to the criteria from RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST criteria: complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease, at 3 months|Evaluation of personal dosimetry for the administration of [131I]ICF01012., assessed by whole-body planar studies and tomographic imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT, Selection phase : Day 0, Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7; therapeutic phase : Day 15, Day 18 and Day 25, Day 74
This study will include a maximum of 36 patients. This study will begin with a preselection part that consists of an injection of \[131I\]ICF01012 at a diagnostic dose (185 MBq) in order to preselect patients who will receive the therapeutic dose according to the dosimetry results : binding of \[131I\]ICF01012 on at least a tumoral lesion and an acceptable radiation absorbed dose to major organs.

The second phase will consist of a therapeutic part with a single administration of \[131I\]ICF01012 at a therapeutic dose. This part is a dose escalation model (4 levels of therapeutic dose were tested)
