Cost Utility of Radical Surgery in Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the medico-economic impact of adherence to INCa (National Cancer Institute) guidelines in ovarian cancer surgery by assessment of outcome in cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY).
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: Collection of additional data with questionnaires
Cost-utility study, The primary endpoint is defined as cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) at 3 years. Patient utilities will be obtained from the EuroQoL 5D-3L questionnaire., 5 years and 6 months
Rate of institutions adherent to INCa quality indicators, The rate of institutions adherent to INCa quality indicators corresponds to the number of institutions adherent to INCa quality indicators among the total number of institutions., 2 years and 6 months|Rate of patients "adherent" to INCa quality indicators, The rate of patients "adherent" to INCa quality indicators corresponds to the number of patients adherent to INCa quality indicators among the total number of patients., 2 years and 6 months|Quality of life, The quality of life will be evaluated according to the QLQ-C30, QLQ-0V28 and the EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, 5 years and 6 months|Budgetary impact on the health insurance budget of these INCa quality indicators on the care management of ovarian cancer patients, Budgetary impact on the health insurance budget of these INCa quality indicators on the care management of ovarian cancer patients using costs data collected from the French insurance databases, Medical Information Departments of each participating centers and from patients' questionnaires (treatment costs, other induced costs and avoided costs)., 5 years and 6 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from inclusion until progression or death from any cause, 5 years and 6 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from inclusion until death from any cause or last follow-up news (censored data)., 5 years and 6 months|Morbidity, Morbidity will be assessed through recording of adverse events using NCI-CTCAE toxicity classification and vital signs measurement., 5 years and 6 months
This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative and non-randomized study designed to investigate the medico-economic impact of adherence to INCa guidelines in ovarian cancer surgery by assessment of outcome in cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY).

A cost-utility study will be performed. It will primarily aim to assess the Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) at 3 years of the two treatment strategies of ovarian cancer surgery: adherence to INCa quality indicators versus non-adherence to INCa quality indicators.

Consecutive patients with stage IIIC and IV ovarian, tubal, and primary peritoneal malignancies will be recruited in different health care institutions, including comprehensive cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals.

Evaluation of adherence to quality indicators will be assessed retrospectively (once patients have completed the treatment) by two independent experts.

200 patients will be included over a period of 2 years and will be followed for a 3 years period after treatment (every 4 months the first two years and then every 6 months).
