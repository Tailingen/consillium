A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of AK127 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of AK127 as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AK127
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment, From the subject signs the ICF to 30 days (AE) and 90 days (SAE) after the last dose of study treatment or initiation of other anti-tumor therapy, whichever occurs first|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected or definite relationship to study drug, During the first 21 days
PFS, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first assessed by investigator Per RECIST 1.1., Up to 2 years|ORR, Efficacy measures such as overall response rate (ORR), which is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR by IRRC based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|DCR, Disease control rate (DCR), which is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|DOR, Duration of response (DoR), which is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 years|TTR, TTR is defined as the time to response base on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|Area under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of AK127, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK127 include serum concentrations of AK127 at different timepoints after AK127 administration, Cycle 1 and 4: Predose, Post-dose-5min,2 hours, 24 hours, Day 4,8 and 15; Cycle 2,3,5,6: Predose and Post-dose-5min; then Predose at Day 1, every 2 cycles (cycle length 21 days),Day30 after last dose; Up to 2 years and 1 months|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK127, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK127 include serum concentrations of AK127 at different timepoints after AK127 administration, Cycle 1 and 4: Predose, Post-dose-5min,2 hours, 24 hours, Day 4,8 and 15; Cycle 2,3,5,6: Predose and Post-dose-5min; then Predose at Day 1, every 2 cycles (cycle length 21 days),Day30 after last dose; Up to 2 years and 1 months|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK127 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK127 include serum concentrations of AK127 at different timepoints after AK127 administration, Cycle 1 and 4: Predose, Post-dose-5min,2 hours, 24 hours, Day 4,8 and 15; Cycle 2,3,5,6: Predose and Post-dose-5min; then Predose at Day 1, every 2 cycles (cycle length 21 days),Day30 after last dose; Up to 2 years and 1 months|Number and Percentage of Subjects with Anti-Drug Antibodies(ADAs) to AK127, The immunogenicity of AK127 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Predose on Day 1 at Cycle 1-6, then Predose at Day 1, every 2 cycles,Day30 after last dose; Up to 2 years and 1 months
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK127 as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study, as a dose escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK127 as a single agent, and describe Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT).
