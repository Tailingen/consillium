A Study to Investigate the Possible Causes of Secondary Effects During Use of Peripheral Midline Type Catheter in Patients Hospitalized in Different Care Settings
Although the use of peripheral venous catheters (CVP) with brachial insertion with echo-guide (Midline) has increased significantly over the last 5-10 years, there are no sensitive data concerning complications in the literature during their use, particularly as regards incidence of thrombotic complication.The prospective observational study will enroll all the patients admitted to Home Health Hospitalization service, Geriatric Department and Intermediate Care service, to whom a Midline-type CVP will be placed for infusional therapy and who will give their consent to participate.
Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis, Secondary
Number of participants with Peripheral deep venous thrombosis (DVP) suspected with Compression ultrasound (CUS) and confirmed by echodoppler, Deep vein thrombosis is investigated with Compression ultrasound (CUS) technique, scheduled once a week from the implant day or performed at the time of occurrence of device malfunctions or at the onset of symptoms resulting from thrombotic complications; echodoppler tecnique is used to confirm diagnosis of thrombosis., Once a week from the implant day until CVP removal or patient discharge, whichever came first, assessed up to 40 days
