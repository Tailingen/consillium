SHR-1210 in Combination With Apatinib in Patients With Metastatic, Persistent, or Recurrent Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in combination with apatinib in treating patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.
Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma|Metastatic Cervical Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: Apatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Up to approximately 12 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression of disease or death from any cause, Up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 24 months|6-month PFS rate, The rate of 6-month PFS, From date of enrollment up to 6 months|9-month OS rate, The rate of 9-month OS, From date of enrollment up to 9 months|Duration of Response (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) in the treatment of SHR1210 in combination with apatinib, Number of participants with adverse events occurring up to 30 days after the last administration are evaluated and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03., Up to approximately 24 months
Impact of the treatment on Quality of Life (QOL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Cervical Trial Outcome of Index (FACT-Cx TOI), The FACT-Cx TOI is a scale for assessing general QOL of cervical cancer patients consisting of three subscales: Physical Well Being (7 items), Functional Well Being (7 items), and Cervical Cancer subscale (15 items). Each item in the FACT-Cx TOI was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative statements (or questions), reversal was performed prior to score calculation. The score ranges 0-116 with a large score suggesting better QOL., Baseline, every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) and up to approximately 24 months|Pain assessed by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Single item from the BPI assessing "worst pain" in the past 24 hours, on a 0-10 scale with a higher score indicating more pain than a low score., Baseline, every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) and up to approximately 24 months|PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells, The efficacy of the combination of SHR-1210 and apatinib as measured by objective response, will be described in patients according to PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative., Up to approximately 24 months|Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB), The impact of TMB on efficacy of the combination of SHR-1210 and apatinib will be explored., Up to approximately 24 months
SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selectively inhibits Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). Patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer who failed to first-line chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab will received SHR-1210 200mg (3mg/kg for underweight patients) iv every 2 weeks and apatinib 250mg orally once daily. The efficacy and safety will be observed.
