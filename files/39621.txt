Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib in Pretreated Patients With Measurable Colorectal Cancer, Stratified by Microsatellite Instability (MSI) Status
This study is being carried out to see if the new drug, olaparib (AZD2281), can effectively and safely treat advanced large bowel cancer. The primary goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether olaparib will have a beneficial effect on the patient's cancer by causing a response and increasing the time it takes for the cancer to progress.

Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the duration from first dose till objective progression or death. In absence of progression or death, the time is calculated from first dose till last evaluable scanning visit., From baseline, i.e. up to 28 days before first study drug dose, and then every 2 cycles (8 weeks) up to objective disease progression by RECIST, assessed up to 35 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration from first dose till death from any cause. In absence of death, the time is calculated from first dose till the date subject last known to be alive, Survival follow-up from first dose till death of the patient or till end of study in absence of death, assessed up to 35 months
