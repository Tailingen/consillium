Exploration of Management Model and Intervention Research on Fear of Cancer Recurrence
1. Through cross-sectional investigation and research, construct an fear of cancer recurrence warning model to identify and screen high fear of cancer recurrencecancer populations, in order to identify predictive factors for high fear of cancer recurrence, study how cancer patients develop susceptibility to fear of cancer recurrence during the diagnosis and treatment process, including which participating factors, explore the development trajectory of fear of cancer recurrence, and effectively prevent the occurrence of high-level fear of cancer recurrence.
2. Through randomized controlled trials, conduct a study on mindfulness and stress reduction psychosocial intervention for high-level fear of cancer recurrence patients, verify the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention measures targeting domestic cancer populations, and improve standardized intervention methods, intervention time, and treatment content.
