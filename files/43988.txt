Tumor Monitoring Using Thermography During Radiation Therapy
This research aims to investigate the correlation between tumor temperature difference and biological factors, such as size, metabolism, treatment response, and tumor aggressiveness.

In addition, normal tissue response to adjuvant radiation therapy in treated organs following surgery, will be evaluated.
Malignancy
OTHER: Thermography imaging
Measurement of IR : Infra-Red radiation emitted at wavelengths 0.8-1nm, Mathematical analysis of the thermic image, Before the first fraction of radiation and every 5 fraction until the end of radiation therapy, approximately 4-5 weeks.
Dermal side effects during radiation therapy using CTCAE v4.0, Clinical assesment of the side effects by physician., Before the first fraction of radiation and every 5 fraction until the end of radiation therapy, approximately 4-5 weeks.|US/CT scans, The tumor size will be measures to evaluate the efficacy of the radiation treatment., The tumor size in cubic cm will be mesured prior to first fraction of radiation, and 2 weeks following the end of radiation session. Time for final evaluation: approximately 6-7 weeks.
During radiation session, the investigators would evaluate the changes that will be detected by thermal imaging and correlate them with visible side effects as well as with known tumor biology factors and skin-tumor distance.
