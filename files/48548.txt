Effect of HPV Integration on Prognosis of Young Women With CIN2 in China
Clinically, cervical precancerous lesion is one of the important diseases that endanger the life safety and fertility of young women. Women with histopathologically confirmed CIN2 need regular HPV, cervical cytology, and colposcopic biopsy if necessary to assess the outcome and progression of the disease. In this study, we intend to visit Fujian Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science \& Technology and other hospitals, including 300 CIN2 participants aged 45 and below diagnosed by histopathology, and collect the remaining cervical secretions and cervical exfoliated cell samples after clinical examination, even if you do not participate in this clinical study. In clinical diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, it is also necessary to collect the above specimens for relevant medical tests. Therefore, it is of great clinical and scientific significance to explore the role of HPV integrated detection in predicting the prognosis of young women with CIN2.

This study aims to:1) determine the correlation between HPV integration and natural outcome in young CIN2 women. 2) determine the prognostic value of different HPV integration status in young women with CIN2. 3) determine the relationship between the integration status of different HPV genes in young CIN2 women and the results of vaginal flora and cervical exfoliative cytology. A prospective cohort of 300 participants under 45 years of age with histopathologically confirmed CIN2 was recruited from multiple centers, and HPV integration status, HPV infection status, cervical cytology, and vaginal flora diversity sequencing were performed at enrollment, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of HPV integration status and flora changes on the outcome and progression of CIN2 women, and to evaluate the correlation between HPV integration status and cervical cytology results.
