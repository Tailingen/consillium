Confocal Reflectance Microscopy of Shave-Biopsy Sites on Skin in Vivo.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new instrument that shines light and takes digital pictures of skin. The goal is to develop a technique that may enable fast and accurate detection of skin disorders and cancers for future clinical diagnosis and surgical use.

PROCEDURE: confocal microscopy in vivo
is to evaluate and quantify the technical feasibility of reflectance CSLM imaging of shave-biopsy sites on skin in vivo., conclusion of study
To assess the quality of the CSLM images of the biopsy sites to determine a point estimate of the proportion of images that will be of acceptable quality for formal analysis in the planned study of intraoperative margin detection., conclusion of study
