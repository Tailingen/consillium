This research study is evaluating a combination of four drugs -- lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone and elotuzumab -- as therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Elotuzumab|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|PROCEDURE: Stem Cell Mobilization
4 Cycle Response Rate, Disease response was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a response of partial response or better using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. Partial Response (PR) defined as 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg/24h; Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg/24h; Complete Response (CR) defined as negative immunofixation on serum and urine and, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and, \<5% plasma cells in BM; Stringent Complete Response (sCR) defined as normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in BM by immunohistochemistry or 2-4 color flow cytometry. The Clopper and Pearson method was used to estimate the 95% CIs for the response rate at Week 12., Participants were followed up to 12 weeks.
Successful Stem Cell Mobilization (SC Mob) Rate, Successful SC Mob defined as the proportion of participants with the ability to collect a total of at least 2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg., The most distant time of stem cell mobilization from time of registration is 21.4 weeks with a median of 15.14 weeks.|4 Cycle Ever Dose Modification (DM) Rate, The 4 cycle ever DM rate is the proportion of participants who started therapy and required dose modification of any study drug during the first four cycles of E-RVD., Participants were followed up to 12 weeks.|Grade 3 and 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) Rate, Grade 3 and 4 TEA rate was defined as the proportion of participants who experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse event of any attribution based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4 (CTCAEv4) on treatment., The adverse event observation period defined as the time on treatment (+30d) is 278 weeks.|Best Responses to E-RVD., Best responses to E-RVD was assessed using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria: Partial Response (PR) defined as 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg/24h; Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg/24h; Complete Response (CR) defined as negative immunofixation on serum and urine and, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and, \<5% plasma cells in BM; Stringent Complete Response (sCR) defined as normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in BM by immunohistochemistry or 2-4 color flow cytometry., Participants were followed up to 273.6 weeks.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) at End of 8 Cycles of Induction Therapy., ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a disease response of partial response (PR) or better using IMWG response criteria. PR defined as 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg/24h; Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg/24h; Complete Response (CR) defined as negative immunofixation on serum and urine and, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and, \<5% plasma cells in BM; Stringent Complete Response (sCR) defined as normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in BM by immunohistochemistry or 2-4 color flow cytometry., Participants were followed up to 24 weeks.|Median Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the first documentation of response partial response (PR) or better. Disease response was assessed using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria: Partial Response (PR) defined as 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg/24h; Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg/24h; Complete Response (CR) defined as negative immunofixation on serum and urine and, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and, \<5% plasma cells in BM; Stringent Complete Response (sCR) defined as normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in BM by immunohistochemistry or 2-4 color flow cytometry., Participants were followed up to 92 days.
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug (in this case elotuzumab) in combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone to learn more about the side effects of this regimen and whether it is effective in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

"Investigational" means that the drug elotuzumab and the combination of this agent with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are being studied. It also means that the the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved elotuzumab for the treatment of cancer. The drugs, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are approved by the FDA. Participants in this trial will have the option to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) following initial therapy with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. ASCT is a standard of care in the treatment of multiple myeloma. All participants, including those who undergo ASCT and those who choose not to, will receive what is referred to as "maintenance therapy" - or continuous treatment - after the initial cycles of treatment with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. The specific maintenance regimen will be determined by risk category.
