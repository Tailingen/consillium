A Study of Pevonedistat Combined With Decitabine and Cedazuridine in Adults With Higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The main aim of the study is to see if signs and symptoms of myelodysplastic syndromes disappear when treated with pevonedistat combined with decitabine and cedazuridine.

Participants will receive an infusion of pevonedistat 3 times during a 28-day cycle. They will also take decitabine and cedazuridine tablets once a day for the first 5 days of the same cycle. A minimum of 6 28-day cycles is recommended, but participants can stop treatment at any time.

A bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow aspirates, and blood samples will be collected during the study.

Participants will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after their last dose of pevonedistat. Once treatment has ended, participants will be followed up with either monthly clinic visits or will be contacted every 3 months.

CR: ≤5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all bone marrow cell lines, ≥11 g/dL Hb, ≥100\*10\^9/L platelet, ≥1.0\*10\^9/L ANC, 0% blasts in peripheral blood; PR: all CR criteria met except bone marrow blasts ≥50% decrease over pretreatment but still \>5%. HI: Hb increase ≥1.5 g/dL if pretreatment \<11 g/dL; platelets absolute increase ≥30\*10\^9/L if baseline\>20\*10\^9/L or increase from \<20\*10\^9/L to \>20\*10\^9/L and by at least 100%; neutrophil increase by 100% and absolute increase of \>0.5\*10\^9/L if baseline \<1.0\*10\^9/L., Up to 30 months|Percentage of Participants with Hematologic Improvement, HI for HR MDS is defined as per Modified IWG Response Criteria for MDS. HI: Hb increase ≥1.5 g/dL if pretreatment \<11 g/dL; platelets absolute increase ≥30\*10\^9/L if baseline\>20\*10\^9/L or increase from \<20\*10\^9/L to \>20\*10\^9/L and by at least 100%; neutrophil increase by 100% and absolute increase of \>0.5\*10\^9/L if baseline \<1.0\*10\^9/L., Up to 30 months|Percentage of Participants with Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence, Platelet Transfusion Independence, and RBC and Platelet Transfusion Independence, A participant is defined as RBC and/or platelet transfusion-independent if they receive no RBC and/or platelet transfusions for a period of at least 8 weeks during the time-period from the first dose of study drug administration through 30 days after the last dose of any study drug. Rate of RBC and/or platelet transfusion independence is defined as the percentage of participants who become RBC and/or platelet transfusion-independent divided by the number of participants who are RBC and/or platelet transfusion-dependent at Baseline., Up to 30 months|Duration of RBC Transfusion Independence, Platelet Transfusion Independence, and RBC and Platelet Transfusion Independence, The duration of transfusion independence is defined as the longest time between the last RBC and/or platelet transfusion before the start of the RBC and/or platelet transfusion-independent period and the first RBC and/or platelet transfusion after the start of the transfusion-independent period, which occurs at least 8 weeks later., Up to 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of combination treatment to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 30 months|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of combination treatment to the date of the occurrence of an EFS event. An EFS event is defined as death or transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), whichever occurs first., Up to 30 months|Plasma Concentration-Time Profile for Pevonedistat and Oral Decitabine and Cedazuridine, Days 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 30 months) post-dose
The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat (TAK-924/MLN4924). Pevonedistat is being tested to treat people who have higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR MDS). This study will look at the overall survival, event free survival and response in people who take pevonedistat in combination with oral decitabine and cedazuridine in addition to standard care.

The study will enroll approximately 94 patients. Participants will be assigned to following treatment group:

• Pevonedistat 20 mg/m\^2 + Decitabine 35 mg + Cedazuridine 100 mg

All participants will receive pevonedistat in combination with decitabine and cedazuridine as specified in the protocol.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone OR plus a final visit after receiving their last dose of drug/compound 30 days after last dose of study drug for event free survival (EFS) follow-up followed by overall survival (OS) follow-up.
