Treating PCOS With Digital Intervention vs. Metformin
With the change in environment and lifestyle, and the improvement of people's understanding of PCOS, the incidence of PCOS is increasing worldwide. According to statistics, the prevalence of PCOS in premenopausal women is as high as 5-20%. Lifestyle interventions are the main treatment option for patients with PCOS. In addition, research has shown that digital therapy can effectively improve behavior changes in diet, exercise, and medication adherence, predict disease progression, reduce the frequency of disease-related symptoms, and promote effective disease management. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of digital intervention versus traditional metformin monotherapy in patients with PCOS.
