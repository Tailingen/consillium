Numerous studies in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials have clearly established the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. NRX 194204, a second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because NRX 194204 is significantly more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs than a first generation approved drug, it is associated with fewer adverse events in clinical use. This study seeks to investigate NRX 194204 monotherapy in patients who have failed any 2 prior therapies.
