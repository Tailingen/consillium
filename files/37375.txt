Surgical Resection Lowers Oxidative Stress Markers in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
Study of Oxidative stress Markers (F2 Isoprostanes for lipid peroxidation, Carbonyl groups for protein peroxidation, 3 Nitrotyrosine for damage by nitrogens, and 8-Hydroxyguanosine for RNA peroxidation)in patients with colorectal cancer undergo surgical treatment (preoperatively during the intervention and postoperatively) and controls.

PROCEDURE: Surgery for colorectal cancer
Comparison of Oxidative stress markers in patients with colorectal cancer and controls, Oxidative stress markers variation (8-PGF2α, Protein Carboyls, 3-Nitrotyrosine, 8-OHG) during and after surgery for colorectal cancer, and compare with controls, up to 2 years
Validation of oxidative stress markers in patients with colorectal cancer undergo surgical resection, Validation of the responsiveness of markers of oxidative stress 8-PGF2α, Protein Carboyls, 3-Nitrotyrosine, 8-OHG)on surgery, up to 2 years
Study of the impact of surgery on Lipid peroxidation, Protein peroxidation, damage by nitrogens, and RNA peroxidation, in patients undergo surgical resection for colorectal cancer and compared with controls, and validation of the responsiveness of oxidative stress markers on surgery
