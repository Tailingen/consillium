Targeting CD19 and CD22 CAR-T Cells Immunotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute B Lymphocytic Leukemia
Evaluation the safety,tolerability, preliminary efficacy,and PK/PD of CD19-CD22 CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute B lymphocytic leukemia.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia， B-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-CD22 CAR-T cells
DLT, Observe wether dose limiting toxicity will happened in dose escalation phase, Form infusion CAR-T cells to 28 days after infusion|ORR, The overall response rate after CD19-CD22 CAR-T Cells immunotherapy, Form infusion CAR-T cells to 2 years after infusion
