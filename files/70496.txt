Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine Versus Follow-up After Resection of Colorectal Liver Metastases
Primary endpoint of the study is to prove the superiority of an adjuvant therapy with oxaliplatin/ capecitabine until the first occurrence of appearance of a tumour. Occurrences in the meaning of this study are the appearance of a relapse of the tumour, of metastases, of a second tumour or death of any reason.
Colorectal Neoplasms|Liver Metastases
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Primary outcomes:|Disease free survival
Secondary outcomes:overall survival,acute- and longtime toxicity of chemotherapy, molecular predictive markers for the risk of relapse and toxicity
Prospective, randomized, multi-centre, open phase III study with two parallel groups of patients according to the eligibility criteria. The times in both hierarchical classified endpoints will be measured as times from randomization.

Patients with macroscopic complete resection of colorectal liver metastases will be randomized in:

Arm A: post-operative adjuvant therapy with Capecitabine/ Oxaliplatin over 6 months and follow-up

or

Arm B: follow-up

Randomization: stratification after Scores of Fong et al:

* number of metastases (1 vs. \>=1)
* maximal diameter of the metastasis (\<= 5cm vs. \> 5cm)
* disease free interval (\>= 12 months vs. \> 12 months)
* CEA (\<= 200ng/l vs. \>200 ng/l) in the strata 0-1, 2 and \>= 3,
