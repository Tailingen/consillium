A Study to Investigate CYC140, in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphoma
This is a 2-part, phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, and efficacy of CYC140 administered orally daily. This study consists of Phase 1 and Phase 2 components in subjects with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma who have progressed despite having standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.
Solid Tumor, Adult Lymphoma
DRUG: CYC140
Maximum tolerated dose, The incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicities (first cycle only) at each dose level, 6 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Assessment of response criteria according to RESIST, Lugano or mSWAT., 18 months
Adverse events, Type, frequency, and severity of adverse drug reactions, 24 months|AUC, CYC140 plasma concentrations, 6 months|Cmax, CYC140 plasma concentrations, 6 months|Tmax, CYC140 plasma concentrations, 6 months|T1/2, CYC140 plasma concentrations, 6 months|Disease Control Rate, To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) in subjects receiving CYC140., 24 months|Duration of Response, To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in subjects receiving CYC140., 24 months|Progression-free Survival, To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects receiving CYC140., 24 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate overall survival (OS) in subjects receiving CYC140., 24 months
Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacodynamic response to CYC140 will be assessed by mRNA sequencing of blood samples to determine differential expression of PLK1 target genes (including MYC, PLK1, CDKN1A) relative to baseline., 6 months|Pharmacogenomics, Genomic alterations will be assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) at baseline and various time points during treatment with CYC140 in order to investigate the relationship between genetic alterations in CYC140 related pathways and response to CYC140.

Parameters of genetic variations (DNA mutations) and copy number variations using plasma cell-free DNA derived from peripheral blood will be assessed., 24 months
Phase 1 part of the study will consist of a dose-escalation and a dose-finding component.

Phase 2 will enroll subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic, histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, who have failed all standard therapies or for whom standard therapy does not exist, into 8 groups:

Group 1: Bladder cancer

Group 2: Breast cancer: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)

Group 3: Lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer \[NSCLC\] and small cell lung cancer \[SCLC\])

Group 4: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancer (BTC)

Group 5: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) including KRAS-mutated mCRC

Group 6: B-cell lymphoma including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

Group 7: T-cell lymphoma (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma \[CTCL\] and peripheral T-cell lymphoma \[PTCL\])

Group 8: Basket cohort: tumor types that are suspected to have a related mechanism of action but are not included in previous groups including, esophageal, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic cancers
