A Study of Ruxolitinib in Combination With Capecitabine in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic HER2-negative Breast Cancer
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial comparing the overall survival of women with advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer who received treatment with capecitabine in combination with ruxolitinib versus those who received treatment with capecitabine alone.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is reported here by the number of days from randomization to death until the data cutoff for the final analysis. The hazard ratio (80% CI) for ruxolitinib versus placebo was estimated using a Cox regression model stratified by hormone-receptor status., Randomization until death due to any cause up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.|Median Survival, Survival was assessed by the time to death or censoring up until 08Feb2016. Participants with no observed death were treated as right-censored at their last date known to be alive. The survival time was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization until death due to any cause up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.|Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Survival, Overall survival was assessed by the time to death or censoring up until 08Feb2016. Participants with no observed death were treated as right-censored at their last date known to be alive. The survival time was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization until death due to any cause at month 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the randomization date to the earliest date of disease progression, as measured by investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per RECIST (v1.1), or death from any cause if earlier. Progression-free survival time distribution and median survival for each treatment group were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization to disease progression, or death due to any cause if sooner up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.|Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate determined by radiographic disease assessments per RECIST (v1.1), by investigator assessment and was defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) at any post baseline visit. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no worsening of non-target lesions and no new lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Randomization through end of study up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR was defined as the difference (in number of months) between the end of response and the start of response for participants who had at least 1 response measurement. The start of a response was the first visit where the participant achieved a partial response or better based on RECIST (v1.1) criteria. The end of response was the earlier of death or progressive disease based on RECIST (v1.1) criteria. The date of progressive disease was the date on which progression was first recorded. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no worsening of non-target lesions and no new lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Randomization through end of study up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.|Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate was defined as a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, determined by investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per RECIST (v1.1) that lasted for â‰¥ 6 months. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no worsening of non-target lesions and no new lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Randomization through end of study up to 19 months or the data cutoff 08FEB2016.
