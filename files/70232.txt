A Study of MBG453 in Combination With Hypomethylating Agents in Subjects With IPSS-R Intermediate, High or Very High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).
This Phase II is a multicenter, randomized, two-arm parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MBG453 or placebo added to hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) in adult subjects with IPSS-R intermediate, high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) not eligible for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) or intensive chemotherapy.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: MBG453|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Hypomethylating agents
Complete Remission (CR) Rate, CR: where the Bone marrow: ≤ 5% blasts with normal maturation of all cell lineages and Peripheral blood: where Hgb ≥ 10 g/dL AND Platelets ≥ 100\*109/L AND Neutrophils ≥ 1.0\*109/L AND Peripheral blasts 0%.

The 2 primary objectives are as follows:

To determine if MBG453 combined with standard HMA therapy improves complete remission in subjects with intermediate, high, or very high risk MDS.

To determine if MBG453 combined with standard HMA therapy improves progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with intermediate, high or very high risk MDS.

This Phase II is a multicenter, randomized, two-arm parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of MBG453 or placebo added to hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine, as per investigators' choice based on local standard of care (SOC)) in adult subjects with IPSS-R intermediate, high or very high risk MDS not eligible for HSCT or intensive chemotherapy. A total of 127 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment arms as follows:

MBG453 400 mg IV Q2W and decitabine or azacitidine Placebo IV Q2W and decitabine or azacitidine

The randomization was stratified by 2 stratification factors: a) HMA (decitabine or azacitidine) selected by the investigator as per the local SOC and b) IPSS-R prognostic risk categories (intermediate, high or very high) at randomization. Crossover between treatment arms was not permitted at any time during the study.
