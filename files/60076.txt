Neoadjuvant Therapy With Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy and the Resultant Pathologic Complete Response Observed in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer;a Systematic Review
The goal of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab in achieving pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the overall rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab?
* Are there any variations in the definition of pCR among the included trials?

Participants in the selected clinical trials were HER2-positive breast cancer patients with non-metastatic operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory breast cancer. The main tasks participants were asked to do and the treatments they received are as follows:

* Undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Participants received chemotherapy treatment before their primary surgery.
* Receive Trastuzumab: Participants were administered Trastuzumab, a targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Researchers would compare the group of participants receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab to other groups, if present, to see if there are differences in the rates of pathological complete response (pCR) or other effects.
HER2+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), 5 trials labelled pCR as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes while 4 trials defined pCR as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the primary tumour at surgery, 5 years
This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab in achieving pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The researchers identified nine clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria. These trials included patients with non-metastatic operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory breast cancer, and they evaluated the pCR as the primary or secondary endpoint.

The trials utilized different chemotherapy and targeted therapy regimens, along with varying dosages of Trastuzumab. The primary outcome of interest was the pCR rate, while other survival outcomes were not analyzed. Among the 1,209 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab, the overall pCR rate was found to be 42%.

The review provided detailed information about the design of the selected trials, patient characteristics, disease staging, HER2 status, administered treatment regimens, and primary/secondary endpoints. It also mentioned slight variations in the definition of pCR across the trials.
