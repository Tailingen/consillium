Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of CARBOPLATIN in Metastatic Prostate Cancer With Gene Alterations in the Homologous Recombination Pathway
The investigators propose a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin monotherapy in the tumor subgroup of metastatic castration-resistant prostatic carcinomas with somatic abnormality in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway.

This study may also better characterize the molecular abnormalities of tumors required for the carboplatin response
