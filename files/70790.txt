Combining EPI-7386 With Enzalutamide and Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to study the effects of EPI-7386 in combination with Enzalutamide on participants diagnosed with prostate cancer. The main goals of this study are to evaluate the antitumor activity of EPI-7386 in combination with enzalutamide in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of EPI-7386 when dosed in combination with enzalutamide. Participants will will take the study drug, EPI-7360, twice a day by mouth and enzalutamide once a day by mouth, alongside clinic visits every two weeks.

Biochemical response rate, Defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) undetectable (\<0.2 ng/mL) at 6 months after treatment. The true BRR for the study population will be estimated based on the number of biochemical responses using a binomial distribution, and its confidence interval (CI) will be estimated using Wilson's method., Post-intervention at Week 4|PSA progesterone-free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is measured from the date of the start of the treatment to the date of progression or death and is censored at the date of last followed for those that have not progressed, Post-intervention at Week 4|Radiographic PFS (rPFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is measured from the date of the start of the treatment to the date of progression or death and is censored at the date of last followed for those that have not progressed, Post-intervention at Week 4|ORR (confirmed), Objective response rate (ORR), Post-intervention at Week 4

The ECOG performance status relies on a scale with scores ranging from 0-5, where 0 indicates the highest function, and 5 indicates lowest function., Post-intervention at Week 4
EPI-7386 is an investigational drug that works by blocking the androgen receptor at a different site compared to the approved androgen receptor blockers. This may increase the effectiveness of this drug and increase the effectiveness of approved androgen receptor blockers when taken together. EPI-7386 is a new drug; therefore, its effectiveness and safety in prostate cancer patients must be studied before it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. EPI-7386 is experimental because it is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Enzalutamide is approved by the FDA for patients whose prostate cancers has spread after receiving treatment. The hypothesis is that adding EPI-7386 to standard hormone therapy will be more effective in treating cancer compared to usual treatment, with the long term goal of discovering more about hormone therapy as a treatment for cancer.
