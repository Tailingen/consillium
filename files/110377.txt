Neoadjuvant Therapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer With Avastin
Recently results have shown that Bevacizumab is active both in monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with ovarian cancer. One of our objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung, breast and colon cancer, and it represents the most common cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. The high mortality associated with OC is due to the lack of screening tests that enable an early diagnosis, thus the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease when the chances of a cure are very limited. In fact, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for stage III-IV OC does not exceed 20-30% in many series. The standard treatment for advanced OC is maximal cytoreductive surgery (or debulking) followed by the administration of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

In recent years, a number of studies have been carried out with antiangiogenic drugs. Specifically, bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be active both in monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with OC that have received multiple previous lines of chemotherapy.

One of the objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients.
