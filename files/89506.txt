Efficacy and Safety Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer (MK-3475-100/KEYNOTE-100)
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) monotherapy in female participants with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) who have received up to 5 prior lines of treatment including platinum-based treatment for ROC (1 to 6 total prior lines counting front line therapy). Participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts based on the number of prior lines of treatment received for ROC. There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.

An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. As specified by the protocol, the number of participants who experienced at least one AE is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B., Up to ~58.8 months (through database cut-off date of 18-March-2021)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) monotherapy in female participants with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) who have received up to 5 prior lines of treatment including platinum-based treatment for ROC (1 to 6 total prior lines counting front line therapy). Participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts based on the number of prior lines of treatment received for ROC. There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.
