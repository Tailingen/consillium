Oblimersen in Treating Patients With Merkel Cell Carcinoma
This phase II trial is studying how well oblimersen works in treating patients with Merkel cell cancer. Biological therapies, such as oblimersen, may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of Merkel cell carcinoma (skin cancer).
Recurrent Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin|Stage I Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin|Stage II Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin|Stage III Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin|Stage IV Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin
BIOLOGICAL: oblimersen sodium|OTHER: pharmacological study|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Overall response rate, Up to 3 years
Time to progression, Progression-free survival probabilities will be computed using Kaplan-Meier methods., Interval between the start of treatment and until the criteria for progression are met, assessed up to 3 years|Occurrence of adverse events, assessed using revised NCI CTC version 3.0, Within 30 days of treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma treated with oblimersen.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the response duration in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug on bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in tumor biopsy specimens from these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
