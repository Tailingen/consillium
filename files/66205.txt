Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Using Hormone Receptor Ligands in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find a way to learn the hormone receptor status of a tumor before surgery is done. By testing for the hormone receptor proteins, doctors can find out if the breast cancer uses hormones to grow. This is important since the hormone receptor status of a tumor helps doctors decide if extra treatment like chemotherapy or pills are needed.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: PET scan with injection of 5-8 mCi of 18FES
To use estrogen-like ligands labeled with positron emitters to preoperatively evaluate the estrogen receptor (ER) status of breast cancer on PET imaging., conclusion of the study
To correlate ER positivity on PET ligand imaging, and conventional immunohistochemical pathologic analysis of ER positivity in surgical specimens., conclusion of the study
