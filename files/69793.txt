TACE Combined With Lenvatinib and PD-1 Inhibitor for Ruptured Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with spontaneous rupture is a potentially fatal complication and usually has poor prognosis. In most conditions, the tumors could not be radically moved. Then minimally therapy like transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) could effectively stanch the ruptured tumor and bleeding vessels. Then TACE combined the Lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor for this subtype HCC could effectively inhibit the tumor and improve the prognosis.

PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitors
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review, 12 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to mRECIST, is defined as the proportion of all included patients whose best overall response including complete response or partial response., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 12 months
Spontaneous rupture of HCC is a life-threatening complication. HCC rupture is considerably higher in China. The tumor size in ruptured HCC is significantly greater than that in non-ruptured HCC. In the acute phase, hemostasis is the first concern and then tumor treatment is secondary. TACE can effectively induce hemostasis. Conservative treatment is usually system therapy for unresectable ruptured HCC. Thus, we conduct this multicenter single arm study to explore the efficacy, safety of TACE combined lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor for unresectable ruptured HCC. This study focuses on the efficacy of TACE combined with lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor as first-line therapy.
