Clinical Study of GT719 Injection for Recurrent/Refractory CD19 Positive Adult B-cell Malignancies
This study is a prospective single-arm open-labled phase I/II clinical trial, including dose escalation and expansion phase, aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cellular pharmacokinetics of GT719 Injection in relapsed/refractory CD19 positive adult B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients. A total of 34 subjects will be enrolled in this study.
