PF-07225570 Alone or in Combination With an Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Recurrent Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of PF-07225570 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in participants with recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. This study consists of 2 parts, single agent dose escalation (Part 1A), dose finding of PF-07225570 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody (Part 1B) and dose expansion (Part 2).
