Clinical Study of Neoadjuvant Therapy With Apatinib and Paclitaxel in Local Advanced Triple-negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patient with TNBC
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
ORR, objective response rate, ten months
DCR, disease control rate, ten months|pCR, pathologic complete response, ten months|DFS, disease free survival, ten months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety], incidence of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.03, ten months
NACT (Neoadjuvant chemotherapy) Increasingly widespread in clinical practice, there is still a substantial proportion of the patients NACT After failing to obtain ORR DCR , NACT Did not receive ORR DCR Patient access ORR DCR Patients have a higher risk of recurrence, and complete NACT The patient, the current standard therapy in the secondary stage of chemotherapy is no longer used, but non-ORR non-DCR After neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with postoperative chemotherapy is worth exploring. Targeted drugs refer to interfere with tumor specific molecular processes and achieve inhibit or block the progression of drugs, its functioning is based on normal cells and tumor cells, differences, which makes the target specificity and side effects of the drug. Target drug is a pioneer in precision treatment of its interpretation of the individualized treatment based on the standard treatment. NCCN guidelines recommend paclitaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy is NACT first-line choice. At the Apatinib for dasatinib therapy in previous studies of breast cancer has a high level of performance, the Apatinib for dasatinib combined with paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer efficacy and safety is better than traditional treatments, is worthy of question.
