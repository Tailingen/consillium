Role of Positron Emission Tomography in Detecting Primary Tumor in Cases of Metastases of Unknown Origin
In most cases of malignancies, the site of origin of the cancer is clear at presentation or identified soon after. However, Metastatic cancer of unknown primary site (MUO) accounts for 3-5% of all malignant neoplasms, and it is defined as metastatic cancer from an unknown primary site, for which no original site can be detected even after performing all possible tests. Most common metastatic sites include the liver, lymph nodes, lungs, and bones.

18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) allows whole-body tumor detection and has proven to be useful in patients with metastasis of unknown primary tumor.
