A Study Combining Treatment With Temsirolimus and Sunitinib for Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study is being conducted to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and efficacy of the combined treatment of Temsirolimus and Sunitinib for the treatment of Advanced Kidney Cancer
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Combination of Temsirolimus and Sunitinib
Initially, an ascending dose design will be used in order to evaluate the tolerability and safety of the combination and to determine the MTD of this combination (dose escalation phase)|Once appropriate doses of each agent have been determined, an expanded cohort of 100 subjects with advanced RCC will be enrolled and treated at the MTD, to obtain further safety and efficacy information
To examine additional efficacy endpoints including: Response rate (RR), Overall Survival (OS), & Progression Free Survival at 6 months and 24 months.|To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of temsirolimus alone and temsirolimus and sunitinib in combination|PK samples will be collected from 20 subjects in the expanded cohort. Concentrations of temsirolimus, sirolimus, and sunitinib will be analyzed using a noncompartmental modeling approach.The PK parameters will include estimation of the peak concentr
A study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of temsirolimus and sunitinib in subjects with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) (dose escalation phase). Once the MTD is determined, this study will also evaluate the efficacy of this combination by determining progression free survivial (PFS) at 12 months in subjects with advanced RCC (expanded cohort phase).
