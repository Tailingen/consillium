Intervention to Address Psychosocial Needs Among Socially Disadvantaged Older Adults With Cancer
The purpose of this study is to convene a group of diverse North Carolina-based community representatives (patients, caregivers, leaders of faith-based organizations, social workers, and patient navigators) to inform the adaptation of materials used to train lay navigators in the delivery of psychosocial support interventions tailored to older socially disadvantaged adults with cancer.

This behavioral study will explore community representatives' perspectives on the resources and training needed to support the development of a lay navigation program tailored to older socially disadvantaged adults with cancer.

It was hypothesized that diverse community representatives could inform the adaptation of training materials (Peer Connect) and subsequent training of community lay navigators, who will then be positioned to address the psychosocial needs of older adults with cancer
