Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Two Asparaginase Preparations in Children With Previously Untreated Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
This multicentric phase III study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant asparaginase (rASNase) in comparison to Asparaginase medac™ during treatment of children with de novo ALL
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: asparaginase|DRUG: recombinant asparaginase
To determine the rate of patients with complete asparagine (ASN) depletion in serum during induction treatment and to demonstrate non-inferiority of rASNase compared to Asparaginase medac™ with respect to this parameter, March 2012
To assess the incidence of patients with hypersensitivity reactions to the first dose of ASNase in the post-induction treatment, March 2012
This multicentric phase III study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant asparaginase (rASNase) in comparison to Asparaginase medac™ during treatment of children with de novo ALL
