Phase 1/2 Study of BBT-176 in Advanced NSCLC With Progression After EGFR TKI Treatment
This clinical trial is the first-in-human study of BBT-176. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BBT-176 (Part 1) and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of BBT-176 (Part 2).
NSCLC
DRUG: BBT-176, QD|DRUG: BBT-176, BID
(Part 1) Incidence of Adverse Events and Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Defined as Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation that occurs from the first dose of study treatment in dose-escalation cohorts as defined in the protocol., 21 days from the first dosing|(Part 2) Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is estimated by the number of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR divided by the total number of patients who are evaluable for efficacy., Every 6 weeks
(Part 1) Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is estimated by the number of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) divided by the total number of patients who are evaluable for efficacy., Every 6 weeks, approximately 1 year|(Part 1) Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameters - Peak Concentration (Cmax), Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBT-176 from Part 1., 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) (each cycle is 21 days)|(Part 1) PK Parameters - Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of BBT-176 from Part 1., 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) (each cycle is 21 days)|(Part 2) Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is calculated for every patient with a response to therapy (PR and CR) and is defined as the number of days from the date of initial response to the date of the first documented disease progression/relapse (including clinical progression) or death, whichever occurs first., throughout study completion, approximately 1 year|(Part 2) Incidence of Adverse Event (AE)s, Number of patients experiencing adverse event (AE)s, throughout study completion, approximately 1 year|(Part 2) BBT-176 Concentrations, Plasma BBT-176 concentrations at steady state, At Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|(Part 2) Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated for each patient as the number of days from the first day of treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first., throughout study completion, approximately 1 year
