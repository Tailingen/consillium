A Study of Everolimus in the Treatment of Neurocognitive Problems in Tuberous Sclerosis
This is a single centre, two-arm, individually randomised, Phase II, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of RAD001 (Everolimus) versus placebo in the treatment of neurocognitive problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). The IMP is a licensed medicine in this patient group but for a different target of effect. The current trial is a proof of principle study for memory and executive function outcomes.

Following an eligibility visit, patients will be scheduled for baseline visit and randomization. They will then be followed up for 6 months undergoing both safety and neurocognitive assessments whilst taking either the placebo or study drug.

48 patients aged 16 to 60 years with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who have IQ \> 60 and a significant deficit in one or more primary outcome measures will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 2:1 to either RAD001 (Everolimus) or Placebo.
