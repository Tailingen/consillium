Bevacizumab and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving induction therapy with bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy with or without capecitabine followed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: bevacizumab|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: leucovorin calcium
Time to failure of strategy
Response according to RECIST criteria|Duration of response|Progression-free survival|Safety according to NCI CTCAE v3.0|Quality of life as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (v 3.0) at baseline, every 3 months during induction chemotherapy, and at discontinuation of treatment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare two strategies of induction bio-chemotherapy followed by the same maintenance biotherapy in terms of time to failure in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.

Secondary

* To compare the two arms of treatment in terms of response rate, duration of responses, progression-free survival, safety, and quality of life of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment center, performance status (0 vs 1), and number of metastatic sites (1 vs â‰¥ 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 induction therapy arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab and FOLFIRI chemotherapy (B-FOLFIRI) as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine once every 12 hours on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

In both arms, patients achieving stable disease after completion of 6 months of induction therapy proceed to maintenance therapy.

* Maintenance therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

During or after completion of maintenance therapy, patients with tumor regrowth that is not classified as disease progression from baseline and who achieved partial or complete response during or after their induction therapy proceed to reinduction therapy.

* Reinduction therapy: Patients receive B-FOLFIRI as described previously. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months during induction therapy, and at discontinuation of study therapy.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
