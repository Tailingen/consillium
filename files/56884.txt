An Adjuvant Study to Evaluate SMS001 (Paclitaxel) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study evaluates the use of SMS001 in patients with lung cancer. SMS001 is a new form of drug Paclitaxel. Doctors want to decide an appropriate safe dose for SMS001 administration, and to see how well it works in treating lung cancer patients.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: SMS001
Evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (Safety and Tolerability), Treatment Emergent Adverse Events included laboratory assessments, physical examination findings, and vital signs., Day 1 to 52 weeks
Incidence of local tumour recurrence, Time from SMS001 treatment to any clinically, histologically or radiologically confirmed local recurrence of NSCLC to mediastinal lymph nodes, 1 year
Disease free survival (DFS), Time from SMS001 treatment to any confirmed recurrence of NSCLC at the end of the study, 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SMS001 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing cancer surgery.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

1. To evaluate tumor recurrence at 12-month follow-up in NSCLC lung cancer patients treated at a predefined dose.
2. To evaluate disease free survival (DFS) for patients treated with SMS001 at the end of study.
