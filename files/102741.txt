5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (5FU/LV) in Combination With Regorafenib in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a non-inferiority randomized phase II trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the third-line setting.

Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between 5FU/LV combined with regorafenib or trifluridine-tipiracil (FTD-TPI) plus bevacizumab.

Arm 1 (Treatment Arm) will consist of the 5FU/LV administered to 26 patients as (LV \[400 mg/m² IV over 120 minutes\], followed by 5FU \[400 mg/m² IV bolus then 2400 mg/m² IV infusion over 46 hours\] in 2-week cycles) and regorafenib will be administered dose of 80-120 mg per day with weekly 40 mg per day increases to a maximum of 120 mg per day for 3 weeks on /1 week off until disease progression, up to 12 cycles of treatment.

Arm 2 (Control Arm) received by an additional 26 patients, will be given as FTD-TPI, administered orally, BID, at a starting dose of 35 mg/m2 of body-surface area, on days 1 through 5 and on days 8 through 12 every 28 days. Bevacizumab, at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, will be administered intravenously on days 1 and 15. The 28-day treatment cycle continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred or consent was withdrawn, up to 12 cycles of treatment.

Efficacy of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer, Overall survival rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib at 12 months., From date of initial treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, treating physician's discretion, or patient withdraws, whichever comes first, assessed up to 18 months.
Progression-free survival rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib, Progression-free survival rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., From date of initial treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, treating physician's discretion, or patient withdraws, whichever comes first, assessed up to 18 months.|Duration of the response of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients, Duration of the response of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients from onset of response to progression or death, whichever occurs earlier according to RECIST v1.1 criteria and investigator's tumor assessment., From date of initial treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, treating physician's discretion, or patient withdraws, whichever comes first, assessed up to 18 months.|Safety and tolerability of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib., To determine the safety and tolerability of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib (determined by diseases progression, unacceptable toxicity, and physician's discretion)., From date of initial treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, treating physician's discretion, or patient withdraws from the study, whichever came first, assessed up to 13 months.
Changes in health-related quality of life, Changes in health-related quality of life from baseline to months 6 and 12, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 scores range from 0 to 100. For global health status/quality of life and functional scales (e.g., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), higher scores indicate better outcomes (improved quality of life or functioning). For symptom scales/items (e.g., fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), higher scores indicate worse outcomes (more severe symptoms)., From baseline to months 6 and 12|Time to treatment failure of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib, Time to treatment failure of 5FU/LV in combination with regorafenib (determined by diseases progression, unacceptable toxicity, and physician's discretion)., From date of initial treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, treating physician's discretion, or patient withdraws from the study, whichever came first, assessed up to 18 months.
