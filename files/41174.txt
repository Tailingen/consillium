Neoadjuvant Lazertinib With or Without Chemotherapy for Patients With EGFR-mutated Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
In the randomized, multicenter Phase II clinical trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lazertinib monotherapy or the combination of Lazertinib and cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable, treatment-naive EGFR-mutant (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) non-small cell lung cancer, ranging from clinical stage IB to IIIB. The study is designed to assess the impact on pathological response, as well as effectiveness and safety considerations.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Lazertinib+Pemetrexed+Carboplatin|DRUG: Lazertinib
Primary pathological response, Primary pathological response refers to the condition where the proportion of viable tumor cells is defined as 10% or less, indicating a substantial reduction in the survival of tumor cells., After neo adjuvant treatment(3months)
Surgical Resection Methods (Segmentectomy or Lobectomy), Surgical techniques defined by thoracic surgeons based on the extent of surgical resection during radical surgery., After radical surgery(3months)|Pathologic Complete Response, Absence of detectable residual tumors in pathological findings after neoadjuvant therapy., After neo adjuvant treatment(3months)|Objective Response Rate, Percentage of patients exhibiting complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria from radiological examinations performed prior to surgical treatment., After surgery(3months)|Event-Free Survival, Duration encompassing disease progression in situations where surgical treatment has not been carried out following randomization, excluding disease progression leading to surgical exclusion, disease progression or recurrence post-surgical treatment, or death unrelated to the cause., End of trial(3years)|Disease-Free Survival, Duration encompassing disease progression, recurrence, or death unrelated to the cause following surgical treatment., End of trial(3years)|Overall Survival, Duration from randomization to death unrelated to the cause., End of trial(3years)|Number of patients with Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0, Evaluation of the safety profile of the protocol treatment summarized in a table for all safety parameters, including:

* Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0, including instances leading to treatment interruption, permanent discontinuation, or death.
* Severe, serious, or specified adverse events.
* Death.
* Laboratory parameters, abnormal findings, and vital signs., End of trial(3years)
