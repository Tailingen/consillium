Efficacy and Safety of Furmonertinib in Patients With EGFR Mutations in Advanced NSCLC With Brain Metastases: A Single-center, Open-label, Phase II Trial（iFORCE）
This study is a a single-arm, single-center, open-label, prospective phase II trial. The aim of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Furmonertinib in patients with EGFR mutation (including 19del or 21L858R or T790M) in advanced NSCLC with brain metastases.
