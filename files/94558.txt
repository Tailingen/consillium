Enzalutamide Implants (Enolen) in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The study is to assess whether the Enolen is safe and delivers anti-androgen medication locally in patients that are planning for radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: enzalutamide
To assess the adverse events associated with the Enolen implant, Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v.5.0)., 3 months|Measurement of Pharmacokinetics Profile, Enzalutamide plasma (ng/ml) and tissue levels (ng/gm), 6 months
MRI changes, Prostate and tumor volume changes (mm3), 6 to 12 weeks post Enolen implantation|Changes in Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Measurements of the amount of PSA in the blood (ng/ml) at baseline through 6-12 weeks post radical prostatectomy, 6 to 12 weeks post radical prostatectomy|Changes in Testosterone, Measurements of testosterone levels in the blood (ng/dl) from baseline to radical prostatectomy, 6 to 12 weeks post Enolen implantation
This study is a single-center, open-label feasibility study. Up to 20 participants planning for radical prostatectomy will be recruited to assess the safety and patient tolerance of Enolen for the localized delivery of enzalutamide into the prostate.

At baseline, patients will undergo multiparametric MRI of the prostate. Study participants will have placement of the drug eluting Enolen implants. Six to twelve weeks later, the patient will undergo a repeat MRI followed by standard of care radical prostatectomy.

Participants will be followed for an additional 6-12 weeks post surgery. Clinical labs and correlative sample collection and patient quality of life questionnaires will be administered at follow-up visits.
