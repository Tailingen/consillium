Aberrant Helix Pomatia Agglutinin Binding Glycan Expression in Follicular Thyroid Tumours
Aberration of glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer cells, and plays an important role in oncogenesis and cancer progression, including metastasis. One of the markers of aberrant glycosylation (O-linked) is the binding of the lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), which has been demonstrated in a wide range of human cancers, especially in tumours with a more aggressive phenotype. Data on the role of HPA within follicular neoplasms of the thyroid gland are currently lacking, therefore we sought to investigate possible changes in cell surface glycosylation associated with this type of neoplasms.
Follicular Thyroid Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Lectin-histochemistry retrospectively performed
Positivity of HPA-labelling, Difference in HPA-binding among the phenotype of follicular lesions - percentage of positively labelled cancer cells: positive = ≥5% of cancer cells labelled positive, between 2005 and 2018
HPA-binding and other tumor markers, A Statistical association of HPA-binding positivity with other known adverse prognostic tumour markers (e.g. capsular or lymphovascular invasion) will be assessed using crosstabs and the non-parametric product limit method. Binary logistic regression models will be further developed using relevant clinicopathologic variables to determine their association with HPA-labelling to produce relative risks (odds ratios (ORs))., between 2005 and 2018
Lectin-histochemistry was performed on 37 archival paraffin wax-embedded specimens of various follicular thyroid tumours (10 follicular adenomas (FA), 10 minimally invasive follicular carcinomas (miFTC), 13 widely invasive follicular cancers (wiFTC) and 4 metastatic follicular thyroid cancers (metFTC)). Sections were scored as positive when ≥5% of cancer cells labelled positive, and scored as negative when \<5% labelled positive for HPA binding. Assessments of HPA-binding were performed by two observers, who were blinded to the identity of the sample, and their results were compared.
