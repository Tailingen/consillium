Targeted Immunotherapy After Myeloablative TBI-Based Conditioning & AlloHCT in CAYA with High Risk T-Cell ALL & Lymphoma
A Phase I trial to determine the safety of targeted immunotherapy with daratumumab (DARA) IV after total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) with high risk T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy).

Pre- and post-HCT NGS-MRD studies will be correlated with outcomes in children, adolescents, and young adults with T-ALL undergoing allogeneic HCT and post-HCT DARA treatment. The study will also evaluate T-cell repertoire and immune reconstitution prior to and following DARA post-HCT treatment and correlate with patient outcomes.
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: Daratumumab
Patients with dose limiting toxicity (per CTCAE v.5), occurrence of any Grade â‰¥ 3 non hematologic toxicity (per CTCAE v.5) which is probably, or definitely related to daratumumab, 60 days
Relapse free survival, To measure relapse free survival in patients post HCT and daratumumab, 1 year
Total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) using best available donor.

Daratumumab (DARA) treatment post-HCT:

Phase 1: 3 dose levels to determine safety (15 patients)

Dose expansion cohort (DEC): Further evaluation of PK and PD (correlative studies/exploratory endpoints) to guide future selection of RP2D (15 patients)

Treatment Schedule:

1. Induction: DARA IV weekly x 8 doses (Weeks 1-8)
2. Consolidation: DARA IV every 2 weeks x 8 doses (Weeks 9-24)
3. Maintenance: DARA IV every 4 weeks (Stop at Day +270)
