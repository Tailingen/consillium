Oral Chemotherapy And Platinum With Radiotherapy Followed Or Not By Consolidation With The Same Chemotherapy In Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomised, phase III study of 2 cycles of oral vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy randomised to either two more cycles of consolidation therapy with oral vinorelbine and cisplatin plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) or BSC alone in patients with unresectable locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival in both arms, the secondary is to evaluate the response rate, overall survival in both arms, to evaluate the safety profile in both arms and to assess quality of life by the LCSS questionnaire.

Assessments of measurable and not measurable lesions been carried out at baseline and every 2 treatment cycles by using RECIST criteria, at baseline and every 2 treatment cycles and Regular Follow Up at 2 months intervals during the 1st year after completion of treatment and then every 3 months until progression of the last evaluable patient
