An Integrated Radio-immunological Approach
The most aggressive primary brain tumors in adults, glioblastomas, are characterized by a profound local and systemic immune suppression. During tumor progression, the infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, especially of myeloid origin, endowed with immunosuppressive function is observed. Aim of this study is to evaluate myeloid cell infiltrate and iron metabolism in tumor-associated macrophages by combining a multimodal MRI imaging technique with immunophenotyping of the tumor microenvironment.
Glioma, Malignant
Evaluate leukocyte/myeloid cell-infiltrate in gliomas by using a multimodal PET/MRI imaging technique, apply iron-sensitive MRI sequences in glioma patients to identify macrophage iron deposits as biomarker of in vivo immune suppression, and correlate these findings with 5-Ala intraoperative data and analysis of MG and BMDM infiltration., 24 months
