The Therapeutic Effect of Different Doses of Capecitabine
To observe the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions of capecitabine in the treatment of advanced colon cancer. A total of 150 patients with advanced colon cancer were selected by convenience sampling and then were divided into the control group (n = 50), the medium-dose group (n = 50), and the low-dose group (n = 50) using a random number table.Different administration regimens of capecitabine were given, and the treatment course was appropriately extended. The therapeutic effect and incidence of adverse reactions were observed.
Capecitabine
DRUG: capecitabine
Clinical efficacy:Overall response rate(RR%), Overall response rate (RR%): complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)/total number of cases×100%., After the end of all treatment cycles (3 weeks per cycle, a total of four cycles, totaling 84 days)|Clinical efficacy:Disease control rate(DR)%, Disease control rate (DR)% = (CR+PR+SD)/total number of cases×100%., After the end of all treatment cycles (3 weeks per cycle, a total of four cycles, totaling 84 days)|Quality of life：QLQ-C30(Quality of Life Questionnaire-core30) Score, Quality of life was scored using the QLQ-C30 (Quality of Life Questionnaire-core30).QLQ-C30 is composed of one global quality of life scale and five functional scales, which include physical function, role function, emotional function, cognitive function, and social function. Scoring criteria: After the scores of each part of the scale were converted to standardized scores, the scores ranged from 0 to 100, and the higher the score of the scale, the better the overall quality of life and functional status., After the end of all treatment cycles (3 weeks per cycle, a total of four cycles, totaling 84 days)|Incidence of adverse reactions, Adverse reactions include hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea and vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and pigmentation. Incidence of adverse reactions%=number of adverse reaction cases/total number of cases × 100%, After the end of all treatment cycles (3 weeks per cycle, a total of four cycles, totaling 84 days)

Afterward, the response rate, quality of life, and adverse reactions of the three groups were collected for comparison.
