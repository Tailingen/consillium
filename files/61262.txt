To characterize safety associated with the use of Kyprolis under the locally approved label.
Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Drug: Carfilzomib + Dexamethasone|DRUG: Drug: Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone
Number of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant after first dose irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment(s). TEAEs were graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v.4.03. Any clinically significant laboratory changes over time were recorded as TEAEs., From the first dose date of any study drug until the end of study or cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier (median [min, max] time on treatment was 43.14 [4.4, 73.4] weeks for the KRd group and 28.79 [0.3, 107.3] weeks for the Kd group)|Number of Participants Who Experienced Serious TEAEs, A serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant after first dose irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment(s) that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another medically important serious event., From the first dose date of any study drug until the end of study or cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier (median [min, max] time on treatment was 43.14 [4.4, 73.4] weeks for the KRd group and 28.79 [0.3, 107.3] weeks for the Kd group)
Kyprolis® (K; carfilzomib) was approved in India on 17 January 2017 as a prescription medication in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) or with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) plus dexamethasone (KRd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) following 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.

This non-comparative, interventional phase 4 study is designed to fulfil the post-marketing requirement to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Kyprolis on Indian subjects with RRMM as per the locally approved label.
