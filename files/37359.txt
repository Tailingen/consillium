A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of KQB198 as Monotherapy and in Combination in Participants With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if KQB198 works to treat advanced hematologic malignancies in adults. It will also learn about the safety of KQB198. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the safe dose of KQB198 by itself or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs?
* Does KQB198 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs decrease the size of the tumor?
* What happens to KQB198 in the body?

Participants will:

* Take KQB198 daily, alone or in combination with another anti-cancer drug
* Visit the clinic about 8 times in the first 8 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks after that
Hematologic Malignancies|Adult
DRUG: KQB198|DRUG: Dasatinib
Number of patients who experience treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and dose-limiting toxicities (Part 1), Safety characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment of AEs, SAEs, and DLTs, from first dose of study treatment to 28 days after last dose of study treatment., 28 Days|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (Part 1), Evaluate safety and assess number of patients with dose-limiting toxicity to determine the RP2D., Up to 30 months|Efficacy of study treatment and optimal biologic dose, as measured by molecular response (MR) per European Leukemia Network (ELN) 2020 Guidelines (Part 2)., Molecular response is the percentage of BCR-ABL fusion protein found in blood. Calculation of molecular response in Part 2 Cohort A will be the proportion of subjects that experience molecular response 4 (MR4) during the time period from 1st dose of study treatment until 6 months of study treatment. Calculation of molecular response in part 2 cohort B will be the proportion of subjects that experience molecular response 3 (MR3) during the time period from 1st dose of study treatment until 6 months of study treatment., Up to 6 Months
Efficacy of Study Treatment, Efficacy of study treatment as measured by molecular response (MR) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and anytime., Up to 30 months|Efficacy of Study Treatment, Efficacy of study treatment as measured by duration of response (DOR). DOR is defined as the time from the date when the response is first observed till the date the response is lost or death, whichever is earlier., Up to 30 Months|Efficacy of Study Treatment, Efficacy of study treatment as measured by time to response (TTR). Response assessments will be summarized by all reported response categories at each visit., Up to 30 months|Number of patients who experience treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and dose-limiting toxicities (Part 2), Safety characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment of AEs, SAEs from first dose of study treatment to 28 days after last dose of study treatment., 28 Days After Last Dose|Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), Up to 30 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to 30 months|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (tmax), Up to 30 months
