Hyperpolarized C Pyruvate Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Blood-Based Biomarkers for Early Detection of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is for researchers to find ways of detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma/PDAC early to avoid the invasive procedure of surgery. The study researchers think a combination of imaging and a series of blood tests may be an effective way to detect PDAC early. In this study, researchers will look at whether a combination of the following types of imaging with blood tests can detect PDAC in pancreatic cysts:

* The ImmunoPET scan (immune-positron emission tomography scan) with the imaging agent 89Zr-DFO-HuMab-5B1
* The HP MRI scan (hyperpolarized pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging scan)
