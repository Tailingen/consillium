Melanoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in the Full Analysis Set Analysis Population, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, or partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR, on two consecutive occasions \>= 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 32 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 32 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to death from any cause., Up to approximately 32 months|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 32 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the sum of a complete or partial response or stable disease rates as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 32 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, The percentage of participants who experienced an Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE). Incidence, nature, and severity of Adverse Events (AE), are reported per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)., From the first study drug to the data cutoff date: 31 August 2022 (up to approximately 32 months)
The study is divided into 2 stages. Stage I of the study is completed when 22 patients with measurable disease have been enrolled and completed ORR evaluation. If the number of responders in Stage I is more than 3, another 16 patients may be enrolled to Stage II.
