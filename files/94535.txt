Study of Olverembatinib (HQP1351) in Patients With CP-CML
A Global Multicenter, Open Label, Randomized, Phase 3 Registrational Study of Olverembatinib (HQP1351) in Patients with Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (POLARIS-2)
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|CML|CML, Chronic Phase
DRUG: olverembatinib|DRUG: Bosutinib
MMR rate Part A, To compare the major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks of olverembatinib versus bosutinib, 24 weeks|MMR rate Part B, To evaluate the MMR rate by 24 weeks of olverembatinib in CML-CP patients with T315I mutation, 24 weeks
The hypothesis suggests that in Part A, olverembatinib leads to a higher MMR rate compared to bosutinib in CP-CML patients without the T315I mutation; and in Part B, olverembatinib can provide therapeutic benefits to CP-CML patients with the T315I mutation.
