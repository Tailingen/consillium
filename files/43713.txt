A Pilot Study to Determine Optimal Procedure Steps to Obtain and Maintain Uterine Artery Occlusion With the D-UAO Device
This pilot study has a sequential design involving three groups to ensure appropriate development and evaluation of the optimal procedural steps of the D-UAO device and to confirm that those steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons.
Uterine Fibroids
DEVICE: GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE™
Optimal procedural steps, Establish and verify optimal procedural steps to obtain and maintain bilateral uterine artery occlusion using the GYNECARE GYNOCCLUDE™ Doppler Guided Uterine Artery Occlusion Device (D-UAO) for 6 hours, and confirm that these optimal procedural steps are reproducible by multiple surgeons, 6 hrs
Fibroid devascularization, Evaluation of the actual and percentage change in the uterine volume, dominant fibroid volume, T2 frequency, contrast enhancement index in the dominant fibroid and the number of patient with complete infarction of all fibroid tissue obtained from a comparison of the baseline and 1 month contrast enhanced MRIs., Baseline and 1 month post procedure|Safety, Incidence of patients with adverse events that result in the following: ureteral stenting, intra-operative or post operative blood transfusion, device related hospitalization \>24hours, interventional treatment for fibroids within 1 month of the D-UAO procedure, DVT or PE, life threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest or other life threatening events, Baseline through one month post procedure
1. Group 1 - beginning with the use of the current instructions for use (IFU) will have adjustments made as necessary to the D-UAO procedural steps for uterine artery occlusion confirmed by 2/3-D Power Colour Doppler ultrasound (2/3DPD).
2. Group 2 - verify that optimal D-UAO IFU procedural steps generated in Group 1 as confirmed by 2/3DPD.
3. Group 3 - verify that the optimal D-UAO procedural steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons in addition to the group 1 investigators, as confirmed by 2/3DPD.
