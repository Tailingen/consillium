A Phase II Trial of Recombinant Human IL-21-expressing Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus Injection (hV01) in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The main goal of this clinical trial is to preliminary evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human IL-21-expressing oncolytic vaccinia virus injection (hV01) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.And the secondary purpose is to evaluate the safety of hV01.
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant human IL-21-expressing oncolytic vaccinia virus injection
Anti-tumor activity of hV01: overall response rate (ORR)., To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., From baseline until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years after the end of treatment.|Anti-tumor activity of hV01: disease control rate (DCR)., To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., From baseline until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years after the end of treatment.|Anti-tumor activity of hV01: duration of response (DOR)., To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., From baseline until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years after the end of treatment.
Anti-tumor activity of hV01: progression-free survival (PFS)., To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., From baseline until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years after the end of treatment.|Preliminary efficacy of hV01: overall survival (OS)., To evaluate the overall survival (OS) as a measurement of preliminary efficacy., From signing informed consent form until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years after the end of treatment.|To assess the adverse events (AEs) and tolerability of hV01., To assess the frequency, severity, and nature of adverse events (AEs) of hV01 administered by multiple intratumoral injections by a predetermined dose levels of 8x10\^8 PFU. This will be determined by abnormalities or changes in vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and laboratory test results., From informed consent till 28 days after first dose.
morphological assessment of tumor cells, To compare the morphological characteristics of tumor cells before and after administration, Day 1 and Day 15 of every treatment cycle，From baseline until the End of Treatment|To assess immune cells in the peripheral blood, To assess the levels of lymphocytes (CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+ cells, CD3+CD8+ cells, CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+, CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells, CD3-CD19+ cells) in the peripheral blood., From baseline to 4 weeks after the End of Treatment.|To assess the expression levels of TILs and protein markers in tumor tissue., To assess the expression levels of infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and protein markers such as PD-L1, HER2, CTLA-4 in tumor tissue before and after hV01 treatment., Day 1 and Day 15 of every treatment cycle，From baseline until the End of Treatment
This is a single-site, single-arm, open-label,exploratory phase Ⅱa study. Based on the safety results of the completed phase I clinical trial of hV01 , 8.0x10 \^ 8 PFU was selected as a dose level of the dosage for each administration in this clinical trial, hV01 will be administered with twice per cycle (on day 1 and day 15), efficacy evaluation will be conducted on day 28, and every 28 days as a treatment cycle,during which safety will be observed.
