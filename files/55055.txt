Safety and Efficacy of Radiotherapy Combined with Immunotherapy for Advanced Malignant Tumors.
The goal of this clinical trial is to find a new radioimmunotherapy regimen for advanced malignancies with multiple metastatic after standard treatment failure/drug resistance. The main questions it aims to answer is: the safety and efficacy of the new regimen for advanced multiple metastatic solid tumors standard treatment failure/drug resistance, and explore the impact on immune function. Participants will receive the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy.
Advanced Solid Tumor
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy
Adverse event rate, The proportion of treatment-related toxicities cases to the total evaluable cases, assessed according to CTCAE 5.0 criteria., 6 weeks
Objective response rate, Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has shrunk to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit., 6 weeks|Disease control rate, Proportion of patients who achieved remission (PR+CR) or stable lesion (SD) after treatment., 6weeks
More effective treatment regimens remain to be explored for advanced malignancies with multiple metastatic after standard treatment failure/drug resistance. The combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy. Studies showed the efficacy of PRaG (PD-1 inhibitor, Radiotherapy and GM-CSF) treatment and stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for advanced tumors. Therefore, the investigators designed a new radioimmunotherapy regimen, including SBRT, LDRT , PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, and GM-CSF. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the new regimen for advanced multiple metastatic solid tumors standard treatment failure/drug resistance, and explore the impact on immune function.
