OLGA and OLGIM Stage System for Gastric Cancer
To validate OLGA and OLGIM staging system with serum pepsinogen for estimating GC risk according to Lauren's histologic classification in South Korea. Also attempted to estimate synergistic interaction among the several risk factors to help establish surveillance strategy.
Stomach Neoplasms|Atrophic Gastritis|Intestinal Metaplasia
The evaluation of OLGA and OLGIM stage systems with serum pepsinogen for prediction of gastric cancer risk, To validate OLGA and OLGIM staging system with serum pepsinogen for estimating GC risk according to Lauren's histologic classification, per 1 year
To validated the OLGA and OLGIM staging system with serum pepsinogen to estimate gastric cancer risk according to Lauren's histologic classification in South Korea, where the incidence rate of GC is high. In addition, the investigators attempted to investigate the interaction among the several risk factors including OLGA or OLGIM staging system for the risk of GC to help establish surveillance strategy.
