Physical Activity to Reduce Joint Pain During Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy
For post-menopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer tumors, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard adjuvant hormone treatment to prolong disease-free survival and time-to-recurrence. Unfortunately, joint pain/stiffness/achiness (arthralgia) is a common side-effect of AIs. This "proof-of-concept" study explores how an evidence-based physical activity (PA) program- the Arthritis Foundation's Walk with Ease (WWE) program- can be adapted for breast cancer survivors on AI therapy to: 1) Help them maintain or achieve recommended levels of PA, 2) reduce their joint pain/stiffness/achiness, and 3) thereby enable them to remain on AI therapy as prescribed.
Joint Pain|Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Walk with Ease
Self-reported joint pain, A valid and reliable 10cm Visual Analog Scale will be used to assess self-reported joint pain. This scale has been used in numerous trials., 6 weeks
Self-reported walking, This will be measured by the number of days walked per week and the number of minutes per walk., 6 weeks
Self-reported fatigue, A valid and reliable Visual Analog Scale will be used to assess fatigue., 6 weeks|Self-reported joint stiffness, A valid and reliable Visual Analog Scale will be used to assess joint stiffness., 6 week|Pain, The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form will be used to assess pain. It is a valid and reliable instrument that has been used in other studies of breast cancer survivors., 6 weeks|Lower extremity pain and function, The Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index will be used to assess hip and knee pain and function., 6 weeks|Quality of life, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), 6 weeks|Beliefs about engaging in exercise, Expectations for Exercise (OEE) scale, 6 weeks|Self-efficacy to manage joint pain, Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASE), 6 weeks|Engagement in Physical Activity, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Questionnaire 2011, 6 weeks|Helplessness, Rheumatology Attitudes Index (RAI), 6 weeks|Adverse event, Self-report of any adverse events will be used to monitor safety., 6 weeks|Feasibility, Achievement of 100% recruitment of the enrollment target and 80% completion will indicate program feasibility., 6 weeks|Tolerability, Self-report of engaging in any walking level during the 6 week period by 50% of participants will indicate tolerability., 6 weeks
