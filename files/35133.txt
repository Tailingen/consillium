Heterogeneity of 68Ga-FAPI Uptake As Imaging Biomarker in T-DXd Treatment for Brain Metastasis of HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study was to explore the predictive value of the heterogeneity of 68Ga-FAPI PET-CT uptake before treatment on the response of T-DXd treatment in patients with brain metastases of HER2-positive breast cancer. The patient underwent 68Ga-FAPI PET-CT examinations within 2 weeks before and after 2 cycles of T-DXd treatment. Heterogeneity index, SUVmax, SUVmean and other uptake values were collected to investigate the association with efficacy of T-DXd.
