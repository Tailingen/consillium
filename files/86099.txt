DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Best Overall Response Rate, The best overall response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response recorded on treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria.

CR and PR must meet the following lesion criteria without having any new lesions as well:

Target Lesion:

(CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Non-Target Lesion:

(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis).

Non-CR/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Must have PR in target lesion., Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months .
Best Overall Response Rate by Histological Subtypes, The best overall response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response recorded on treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria. Please see the primary endpoint "Best Overall Response Rate" description for the definition of CR and PR.

Non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma includes different histologic and genetic subtypes to include: papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, unclassified, translocation, and medullary carcinoma. These subtypes are measured using established methods., Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events, Assessed by -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. All treatment-related all-grade adverse events occurring in \>10% of participants.

Treatment Related is discerned as follows:

* Yes: There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of atezolizumab or bevacizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to atezolizumab or bevacizumab or with similar treatments; and/or the AE resolves upon discontinuation of the study drugs or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
* No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drugs (e.g., pre existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to the study drugs administration., Adverse events are measured continuously on treatment and up to thirty days after going off treatment (up to ~32 months).|Duration of Response, The duration of overall response (based on RECIST 1.1) is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR and PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation., Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.|Immune Related Best Overall Response Rate, The best overall Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR) or Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR) is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

irCR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as complete response (CR).

irPR: Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all target and all new measurable lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SPD increases by \> 25% when compared to SPD at nadir., Measured every 6 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.|Median Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression (PD) or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. In this research the investigators are studying the combination of Atezolizumab with Bevacizumab. Participants will receive both vascular endothelial targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Atezolizumab for Advanced Non-Clear Cell Kidney Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses.

The FDA has approved Bevacizumab with Interferon (IFNα) as a treatment option for Advanced Kidney Cancer.
