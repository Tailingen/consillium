DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants With Either Peripheral Neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 or Myelosuppression Adverse Events (AEs) ≥ Grade 3 Based on Local Laboratory Values, Peripheral neuropathy (sensory or motor) assessment was done at screening, on Days 1, 8, 15 of every treatment cycle, at the End-of-Treatment visit and at the 28-day Follow-up Visit. Changes in neuropathy grade from baseline was reported as an AE as assessed using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Myelosuppression in participants receiving chemotherapy may have manifested as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia. Grade 3 neutropenia including an absolute neutropenia count (ANC) of 500 to 1,000 cells/mm\^3; anemia hemoglobain levels (Hgb) \<8.0 - 6.5 g/dL; \<4.9 - 4.0 mmol/L; \<80 - 65 g/L; transfusion indicated; and thrombocytopenia with platelet levels \<100,000 cells/mm\^3., From the date of the first dose of investigational product (IP) until 28 days after the last dose of IP; up to data cut-off date of 20 November 2016; The median treatment duration for Arms A and B were 3.04 months and 5.17 months respectively.
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events During the Treatment Period, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any AE or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the IP through 28 days after the last dose of IP. Any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and based on the scale:

Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity, assistance may be needed; minimal medical intervention required; Grade 3 = Severe - marked limitation in activity, assistance usually required; medical intervention required, hospitalization is possible; Grade 4 = Life threatening - extreme limitation in activity, assistance required; medical intervention, hospitalization or hospice care probable; Grade 5 = death., From the date of the first dose of IP until 28 days after the last dose of IP; up to a later data cut-off date of 14 July 2017; maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively.|Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event With Action Taken as Study Drug Withdrawn, The percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE with action taken as studydrug withdrawn during the treatment period of the trial was assessed throughout the conduct of the study. Study drug withdrawn (treatment permanently discontinued) was attributed to the part in which the onset of the adverse event took place., From the date of the first dose of IP until 28 days after the last dose of IP; up to a later data cut-off date of 14 July 2017 the maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively|Dose Intensity Per Week of Nab-Paclitaxel During the Entire Study, Dose intensity was the cumulative dose divided by the dosing period in weeks., From day 1 of study treatment to the end date of study treatment; up to data cut off date of 20 November 2016; the maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively|Dose Intensity Per Week of Carboplatin During the Entire Study, Dose intensity for carboplatin was the cumulative dose divided by the dosing period in weeks.", From day 1 of study treatment to the end date of study treatment; up to data cut off date of 20 November 2016; the maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively|Percentage of Participants With Dose Reductions During the Entire Study, A dose reduction occurred when the dose assigned at a visit was lower than the dose assigned at the previous visit. Dose reductions were typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and/or TEAEs or toxicities., From the first dose of study treatment to discontinuation date of study treatment; up to date cut off date of 20 November 2016; the maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively|Percentage of Participants With a Dose Delay During the Entire Study, A dose delay occurred when the dose assigned at a visit was held compared to the previous visit. Dose delays were typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and/or TEAEs or toxicities., From the first dose of study treatment to discontinuation date of study treatment; up to date cut off date of 16 November 2016; the maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time in months from day 1 of treatment to the date of disease progression based on the investigator's assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria (documented by radiological assessment) or death (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cut-off date, which ever occurred earlier. RECIST V1.1 criteria includes: - Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; - Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline; - Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease (PD); - Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir, From first dose of IP to the date of disease progression; up to a later clinical cut-off date of 14 July 2017; for Arms A and B participants were followed for PFS for 31 months and 20 months respectively|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time in months between day 1 of treatment and death from any cause). Participants who were still alive as of the clinical cut-off date had their OS censored at the date of last contact or clinical cut-off, whichever was earlier. Participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study or who were withdrawn from the study were censored at the time of last contact., From first dose of IP to the date of death due to any cause; up to a later clinical cut-off date of 14 July 2017; for Arms A and B participants were followed for OS for 31 months and 33 months respectively|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who had radiologic CR or PR compared to baseline (radiographic evaluation on the day of or within 28 days prior to randomization) according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria as determined by the investigator, which was confirmed by repeated radiologic assessment performed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response were first met and occurred between Day 1 of treatment and the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, death or study discontinuation. A complete response and partial response per RECIST V 1.0 criteria was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline., From the first dose of IP to the date of documented first response; up to the data cut-off date of 14 July 2017; maximum treatment duration for Arms A and B was 16.6 months and 20.1 months respectively.
This is a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of continuous weekly versus weekly times three with one-week break nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment in elderly subjects (≥ 70 years old) with advanced non small cell lung cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for their advanced disease and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The primary study endpoint is the percentage of subjects with either peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression adverse events. Patients will continue treatment until they develop progressive disease, unacceptable side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study, according to local standard of care. Patients will have radiographic evaluations every 6 weeks while on treatment.
