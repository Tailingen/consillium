Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC) ,a kind of Hepatocellular carcinoma, is the sixth most common cancer and thesecond leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world.Currently, Surgical resection is still the main treatment methods of early the ICC, but that is high recurrent . Levamisole Hcl is a broad spectrum of intestinal worm medicine, our previous study have found levamisole could significantly promote the apoptosis of bile duct cancer cells, restrain the progress of the bile duct carcinoma in clinic and prolong survival time.This drug is applicable to a variety of reasons caused by intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma and extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma,so we carry out the study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Levamisole Hcl in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
