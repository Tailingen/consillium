Safety and Early Signs of Efficacy of IL12-L19L19.
The purpose of this study is to describe the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of the antibody-cytokine fusion protein IL12-L19L19 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid carcinomas, after previous immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of IL12-L19L19 and to establish MTD in order to establish a recommended dose (RD).

The secondary objectives of the study are to assess early signs of efficacy, the determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and the immunogenicity of IL12-L19L19.

For Part I: DLT, Occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in dose escalation part of the study., From Day 1 to Day 28 of the treatment|For Part I: MAD, Definition of Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) (in dose escalation part). The MAD is defined when at least two patients within a cohort of 2-6 patients experience a DLT (i.e., â‰¥33% of patients with a DLT at that dose level), From the enrollment of each patient until the completion of the treatment (for a maximum of 8 weeks)|For Part I: MTD, Defining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommendation of the Recommended Dose (RD): when the DLT rate reaches 33% in a cohort, the next lower dose level will be called the MTD (so long as the DLT rate is less than 33%). Accordingly, the recommended dose (RD) for the Dose Expansion cohort will be the MTD., From the enrollment of each patient until the completion of the treatment (for a maximum of 8 weeks)|Safety (AE), Safety of administration of IL12-L19L19, through an assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0, CTCAE), Throughout study completion for each patient, a maximum of 24 weeks for each patient|Safety (SAE), Safety of administration of IL12-L19L19, assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0, CTCAE), Throughout study completion for each patient, a maximum of 24 weeks for each patient|Safety (DILI), Evaluation of possible Drug Induce Liver Injury, caused by IL12-L19L19, assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0, CTCAE), Throughout study completion for each patient, a maximum of 24 weeks for each patient

Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. ORR is the sum of partial responses (PR) plus complete responses (CR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (v. 1.1) criteria., At 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 48 weeks.|PFS, Progression Free Survival (PFS) the time from enrolment to progression or death from any cause., At 24 weeks and 48 weeks.|OS, Overall Survival (OS) is defined beginning from enrolment to death from any cause, At 24 weeks and 48 weeks.
