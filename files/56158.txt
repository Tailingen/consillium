Clinical Efficacy of Trastuzumab in Combination With Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin for the Treatment of HER2-positive Advanced Gastric Cancer.
Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy prolonged the median overall survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Among chemotherapy regimens, oxaliplatin is generally more convenient and tolerable than cisplatin, and becoming an increasingly popular option for the treatment of AGC. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) in HER2-positive AGC.
Advanced Gastric Carcinoma
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Loco-regional and Distant Tumor Control After Completion of Treatment, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was used to measure outcome:

Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., 12 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), 28 months|Overall survival (OS), 28 months
