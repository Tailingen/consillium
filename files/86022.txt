Compassionate Use of Mifepristone in Brain/Nervous System and Other Cancers
The purpose of this study is to see if mifepristone prevents worsening of your cancer. Mifepristone is an antiprogesterone agent, a drug which blocks female hormones, that is commonly used for the termination of pregnancies. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of cancer. It is unlicensed in the United States for your condition. However, previous work has indicated that mifepristone may be useful due to how it works. It is being made available for use in the United States for compassionate use through the Feminist Majority Foundation.
Cancer
DRUG: Mifepristone
Duration of Response, The time from the date of response (not the beginning of treatment unless there is stable disease) to disease progression. Response and progression are evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for Progressive Disease; Progressive Disease (PD), 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 5 years
Toxicity Associated With Adrenal Insufficiency, Toxicity will be evaluated per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Frequency and severity of adverse events will be tabulated using counts the following events of interest, which are related to possible adrenal insufficiency: nausea, vomiting, lethargy, dizziness, fatigue, anorexia, and skin rash. Any grade of these events that are self-reported by patients as well as events identified by physician assessment (e.g. physical exam) will be included., Up to 8 weeks after the end of study treatment or until any adverse events are resolved (whichever is longest)
Overall Survival, The time from patient entry into the protocol to death by any cause., 5 years
