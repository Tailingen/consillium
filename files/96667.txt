A Trial Evaluating Stereotactic Radiotherapy Plus Durvalumab Continuation for Patients With NSCLC Metachronous Oligometastatic Disease Under Durvalumab Consolidation Following Chemoradiation
This study is a single-arm phase II, multicenter study designed to evaluate the activity of stereotactic radiotherapy plus the continuation of durvalumab for 12 more months for patients presenting with NSCLC metachronous oligometastatic disease during post-chemoradiotherapy durvalumab consolidation.

Fifty patients will have to be enrolled in this phase II trial.

Total duration of treatment will be 12 months.

Patients will be followed for a maximum of 2 years following the date of inclusion.
