Abiraterone, Radiotherapy and Short-Term Androgen Deprivation in Unfavorable Localized Prostate Cancer
The addition of abiraterone acetate to standard treatment of radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation will increase the frequency of undetectable PSA.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Androgen deprivation|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Prednisone
Percentage of Patients With Undetectable PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) at 1 Year, The percentage of patients with undetectable PSA after 1 year will be calculated. Undetectable PSA is defined as a measurement of \<0.1 ng/mL., 1 year
Time to PSA Nadir, The median time in months to the lowest PSA value from the start of study therapy., 1 year|PSA Nadir Value, The lowest PSA value from the start of study therapy., 1 year, 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Biochemical Progression-free Survival (BPFS), Disease progression defined as Phoenix RTOG definition of nadir PSA + 2ng/ml or initiation of salvage therapy not imaging. The two outcomes use different measures (biochemical as measured by PSA increase vs radiographic as measured by imaging), yielding different results in this case., 36 and 48 months|Metastasis or Systemic Therapy, Time to either imaging indicating metastasis or beginning a new systemic therapy. This is a distinctly different measure from number 4 above. The two outcomes use different measures (biochemical as measured by PSA increase vs radiographic as measured by imaging), yielding different results in this case., up to 5 years (60 months)|Testosterone Recovery, Time to testosterone recovery, up to 5 years|PSA < 1.5ng/ml in Setting of Non-castrate Testosterone, Percentage of men with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 year PSA \< 1.5ng/ml in setting of non-castrate testosterone., 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years|Safety and Tolerability, The number of patients experiencing an adverse event of at least grade 3 that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy per CTCAE version 4.0., 6 months
This is a single arm two-site study of 37 men with unfavorable prostate cancer (defined as having a single high risk factor). Patients will concurrently initiate 6 months of standard-of-care GNRH agonist therapy and once daily abiraterone acetate/prednisone. After 2 months of lead-in hormonal treatment, definitive standard-of-care prostate/seminal vesicle radiotherapy will be delivered, to a total dose of 75-80 Gy.
