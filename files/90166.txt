Zoledronate, Vitamin D, and Calcium With or Without Strontium 89 or Samarium 153 in Preventing or Delaying Bone Problems in Patients With Bone Metastases From Prostate Cancer, Lung Cancer, or Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Zoledronate, vitamin D and calcium may prevent or delay bone pain and other symptoms caused by bone metastases. It is not yet known whether giving zoledronate together with vitamin D and calcium is more effective with or without strontium 89 or samarium 153 in treating patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium to see how well they work compared to zoledronate, vitamin D, calcium, and either strontium 89 or samarium 153 in preventing or delaying bone problems in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.

Time to Development of a Malignant Skeletal-related Events (SRE), Median time to development of a malignant skeletal related event (SRE), which is defined as a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone or radiation to bone is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The time of failure was measured from date of randomization to the date of a documented SRE. The analysis was planned to occur after 257 SRE have been observed, unless the criteria for early stopping are met., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 80.1 months.
Number of Patients Experiencing a Skeletal-related Event (SRE) Within One Year, Skeletal-related events are defined as a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone or radiation to bone., From randomization to 1 year|Overall Survival, Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact., From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 101.7 months.|Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) at One Year, The FACT-G is a validated 27-item measure in which a higher score represents higher quality of life (QOL). Physical, functional, social and emotional well-being subscale scores are added together to form the FACT-G total score. Responses range from 0=Not a lot to 4=Very much. Certain items must be reversed before being added, by subtracting the response from 4. Subscale items are added together, multiplied by the number of items in the subscale, then divided by the number of items answered to obtain subscale totals. Total score ranges from 0-108; physical, social and functional subscales from 0-28; emotional subscale from 0-24. Each subscale requires at least 50% of the items to be completed while the overall response rate must be greater than 80%. If items are missing the subscale scores can be prorated. Change score at one year is calculated as one year score - baseline score with a positive change score indicating improvement in QOL., Baseline and 1 year|Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at One Year, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a measurement tool for assessing clinical pain. The BPI assesses severity (pain at its "worst," "least," "average," and "now"), and interference (how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep). Patients rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no pain/interference and 10=interferes completely/worst pain imaginable., Baseline and 1 year|Change in EuroQol-5 Dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) at One Year, The EQ-5D-3L is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire. First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 3 problem levels (1-none, 2-moderate, 3-extreme). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm 10-point interval scale. Worst imaginable health state is scored as 0 at the bottom of the scale, and best imaginable health state is scored as 100 at the top. Change at one year is calculated as one-year score - baseline score with positive change indicating improved quality of life., Baseline and 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the efficacy of zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium with or without strontium chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium, in terms of preventing or delaying the time to development of malignant skeletal-related events (SREs) (defined as a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, or radiation to bone) in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate, lung, or breast cancer.

Secondary

* Compare the rate of SREs at 1 year in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the effect of these regimens on pain control in these patients.
* Evaluate resource utilization and cost effectiveness of these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to primary disease site (prostate vs breast vs lung) and number of bone metastases (â‰¤ 2 vs \> 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months from start of protocol treatment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
