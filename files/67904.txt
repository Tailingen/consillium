Efficacy and Safety of Oral Azacitidine Compared to Investigator's Choice Therapy in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory AITL
This study evaluates the efficacy of Oral azacitidine versus single-agent Investigator's Choice Therapy in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma.

Compared to B-cell Non-Hodgin Lymphoma (NHL), Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL) is more resistant to conventional chemotherapy and is generally associated with an inferior outcome. In case of relapsed of refractory disease, survival durations are in the range of only a few months.

Several agents have been evaluated in this setting in recent years: romidepsin, bendamustine or belinostat. The response rate with these agents rarely exceeds 30% and responses are usually of limited duration.

Azacitidine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with various myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes. In this case, azacitidine significantly increase the survival time compared to standard of care option. This response to azacitidine could be correlated to the existence of recurrent mutations and those mutations have also been described in AITL.

The present protocol will use Azacitidine according to the same schedule than in MDS that is continuous treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
