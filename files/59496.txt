Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Transitional Cell Carcinomas
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) and sargramostim (GM-CSF), use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Combining vaccine therapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving vaccine therapy together with BCG and sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone cystectomy for transitional cell carcinomas.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: TICE®-strain BCG|BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1 protein|BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities, All adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) (Version 3.0). A Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as:

* ≥ Grade 2 autoimmune phenomena
* Asymptomatic bronchospasm or generalized urticaria
* ≥ Grade 3 hematological and non hematological toxicities. To be dose limiting, an adverse event must have been definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of the study treatment. Patients who experienced a DLT were removed from study., up to 12 weeks
Number of Patients Developing NY-ESO-1 Antibodies After Treatment, Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 for the assessment of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., up to 12 weeks|Number of Patients With CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell Responses., Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 for the assessment of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell responses by ELISPOT. T-cell responses were monitored after in vitro sensitization with either overlapping peptides from NY-ESO-1 or recombinant adenovirus encoding NY-ESO-1 (adeno-NY-ESO-1), and with control peptides or recombinant vectors encoding Influenza-derived proteins., up to 12 weeks|Delayed-type Hypersensitivity (DTH) as Measured by the Number of Participants With Induration and/or Redness at Each Timepoint, NY-ESO-1-specific DTH skin reaction was measured at baseline and weeks 3 and 8.The peptide solution (10 μg peptide in 0.1ml normal saline) was injected intradermally at a separate site from the vaccination to give a visible and palpable skin depot. Assessment of DTH reactions was performed 48 h after injection.

The extent and intensity of DTH reactions was documented by measuring visible "redness", palpable "induration" and other signs of local skin irritation or necrosis., up to 8 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine, Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in post-cystectomy patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen.
* Determine the immunological profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine mixed with BCG intradermally (ID) once weekly on weeks 1 and 2. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 protein mixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) ID once weekly on day 2 of weeks 3-6. Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone on days 1, 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 3-6.
