Intranasal Transmucosal Fentanyl Pectin for Breakthrough Cancer Pain in Radiation-induced Oropharyngeal Mucositis
An open-label, non-randomized study to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl pectin nasal spray for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain secondary to radiation-induced mucositis in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain.

Study objectives include assessment of breakthrough pain episodes related with food intake in patients with mucositis secondary to radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy for head and neck tumors
Breakthrough Pain|Mucositis|Radiotherapy|Chemotherapy|Head and Neck Cancer
Pain Intensity Difference, Pain Intensity difference: Pain Intensity will be measured 30 min after starting food intake during the screening phase and 30 min after intranasal transmucosal fentanyl in pectin administration/food intake during the treatment phase, 30 minutes after PecFent administration
number of episodes of breakthrough pain requiring additional (rescue) analgesic treatment after administration of the study medication, The number of episodes of breakthrough pain requiring additional (rescue) analgesic treatment after administration of the study medication.

Patient rating of drug efficacy measured on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = ineffective, 10 = totally effective).

Quality of life assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire -INF025 in its validated Spanish version, administered on the screening visit and at the end of the study.

Patient rating of drug ease of use measured on a scale from 1 to 4 (1 = very complicated, 4 = very simple)., 12 episodes of breakthrough pain presenting within a maximum of 7 days.
safety of intranasal transmucosal fentanyl, The appearance of adverse effects during the study Physical examination at each visit Vital signs: blood pressure, pulse Concomitant medication for breakthrough pain Reasons for patient study withdrawal (in the event of withdrawal), 7 days
An open, non-randomized study design was used to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl in pectin for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain secondary to radiation-induced mucositis. The study plans to include 30 evaluable patients from multiple centers throughout the country. The trial comprises a screening period, an open titration period, and an open-label treatment period in which at least 12 breakthrough pain episodes are to be treated.
