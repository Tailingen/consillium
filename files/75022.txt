Reoperation Rate in Breast-Conserving Surgery Using Confocal HistologÂ® Scanner for Intraoperative Margin Assessment
This PMPF study is proposed to evaluate in real life the reoperation rates (ROR) of breast cancer and/or DCIS surgery when including the use of the HLS in the context of breast lumpectomy margin assessment.
