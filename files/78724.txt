Biomarker Analyses in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients Treated With TheraSphereÂ®
To analyze specific angiogenic, inflammatory and immune profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma patients who undergo radioembolization.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: Plasma collection
Percentage change in angiogenic, inflammatory and immune biomarkers, The percent of change at 7 different timepoints for the following biomarkers will be calculated: Ang-2, FGFb, HB-EGF, HGF, PDGF-BB, PIGF, SDF-1, VEGF, VEGFC, IFNg, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNFa trimer, CRP, TGFb1, EGFR, PD-1, PD-L1, CD45RA, CD127, HLA-DR, CD62L, CD3, CD8, CD197, CCR7, CD45RO, PD-L2, FOXP3, Perforin, Granzyme, TIA-1, CD14, CD107a, CD25, CD45, CD4, CD20 and CD56+16., 2 years
Treatment Response- AFP, Alphafetoprotein will be measured in ng/mL., 2 years|Treatment Response - Imaging, Lesions will be measured using mRECIST., 2 years|Treatment Response- Time-to-Progression, Time-to-progression will be measured in days., 2 years|Treatment Response- Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured in days., 2 years
Patients who have planned lobar radioembolization (TheraSphere (TS)) and consent to this study will have peripheral blood samples collected pre-TS, post-TS, 4 hours post-TS, 24 hours post-TS, 3 days post-TS, 7 days post-TS and 30 days post-TS to analyze specific angiogenic, inflammatory and immune profiles.
