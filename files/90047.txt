Observational Study for Assessing Treatment and Outcome of Patients With Primary Brain Tumours Using cIMPACT-NOW and 2021 WHO Classification
Every new classification depends on its prognostic power and on the type of treatment given. With the rapid evolution of diagnostic methods and the advance in new treatments, there is much less reliable information available on how patients with newly defined brain tumour entities should be treated and what to expect from the current treatments.

The goal is to determine whether the new 2021 WHO classification, based on cIMPACT-NOW recommendations, results in more homogeneous patient groups than the old 2016 classification. Furthermore, it will help derive provisional guidelines on how patients with these newly defined tumour entities are best treated. These recommendations will be based on the experience of EORTC investigators with chosen treatments and their experience as reported in this data collection report.

Overall survival, Date of surgery that allowed for the first pathological diagnosis up to the date of death (any cause). Patients will be followed up for 5 years after enrolment., Last patient is expect in 2025 and will be followed up for 5 years, the analysis will take place in 2030.
Progression free survival, From the date of start of the anti-tumor therapy until the date of first objective progression as determined by the local investigator or the date of patient's death whichever occurs first. Patients will be followed up for 5 years after enrolment., Last patient is expect in 2025 and will be followed up for 5 years, the analysis will take place in 2030.|Best overall and objective response, Recorded from the date start of an anti-tumor therapy until disease progression or start of a new anti-tumor therapy. Patients will be followed up for 5 years after enrolment., Last patient is expect in 2025 and will be followed up for 5 years, the analysis will take place in 2030.
