Artificial Intelligence in Large-scale Breast Cancer Screening
This is a prospective clinical trial following a paired screen-positive design, with the aims to assess the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm as an independent reader, in addition to two radiologists, of screening mammograms in a true screening population. Since all decisions by individual readers will be recorded, it is possible to determine what the outcome would have been had one or two of the readers not been allowed to assess images, and to determine what the outcome would have been had the recall decision been performed by consensus decision (actual) compared to single reader arbitration of discordant cases.
