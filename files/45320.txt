Dose Reduction of Preoperative Radiotherapy in Myxoid Liposarcomas
To study the feasibility of reducing the dose of preoperative radiotherapy in MLS (Myxoid Liposarcomas) from 50 Gy to 36 Gy while maintaining comparable clinicopathological responses.
Myxoid Liposarcoma of Soft Tissue
RADIATION: dose reduction of preoperative radiotherapy in MLS
The Pathological description of the percentage pathological responses after reduced RT (radiotherapy) dose from (conventionally) 25 x 2 Gy to 18 x 2 Gy (in the current study), The percentage of pathological responses will be pathologically assessed on the resection specimen; this procedure will take on average 7-10 working days. After surgery, patients will be followed up to 10 years.
* A Bayesian approach is considered for the analysis of this trial. The aim is to provide a stopping rule for inefficacy of the new dose.
* Two aspects are important to elucidate the mechanism of this treatment: dynamic investigations of perfusion and vasculature. Apart from participation to the dose reduction paragraphs of this study, patients will be also asked to undergo, at clinically relevant dose points, dynamic contrast enhanced (DEC) MRI scans and separately tumor biopsies.
