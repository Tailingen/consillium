A Study of Targeted Agents for Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer
This is a Phase IB/II multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted agents with or without cancer immune checkpoint therapy with atezolizumab in participant with recurrent and/or persistent endometrial cancer. The main protocol provides a platform for genomic screening with homogeneous basic eligibility criteria in order to direct study participants into biomarker-matched study cohorts consisting of testing targeted agents.

This is a Phase IB/II multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted agents with or without cancer immune checkpoint therapy with atezolizumab in participants with recurrent and/or persistent endometrial cancer.

This biomarker-driven study provides a platform whereby participants with persistent/recurrent endometrial cancer will be placed into study cohorts evaluating targeted agents selected on the basis of the tumor's specific genomic profile. Prospective participants with persistent and/or recurrent endometrial cancer will be prescreened within 60 days of treatment assignment to have a tumor tissue sample submitted for next-generation sequencing (NGS) using FoundationOne® companion diagnostic (CDx) testing prior to entering screening. If a participant has FoundationOne® CDx testing within five years of enrollment, the previous tumor tissue may be re-analyzed for use in the study.

Depending on the cohort assignment per the tumor's biomarker profile, participants will be assigned to the AFT-50A Protocol (atezolizumab+targeted agent) or the AFT-50B Protocol (non-atezolizumab targeted agents). The current study cohorts are as follows:

AFT-50A Cohorts

* Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab doublet - Closed to Accrual
* Atezolizumab + Ipatasertib doublet - Closed to Accrual
* Atezolizumab + Talazoparib doublet
* Atezolizumab + Trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) doublet - Closed to Accrual
* Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab doublet

AFT-50B Cohorts

* Inavolisib + Letrozole doublet
* Giredestrant + Abemaciclib doublet

It is anticipated that approximately 20 participants will be enrolled in each study cohort in AFT-50A and 24 participants in each study cohort in AFT-50B, unless otherwise specified for a given cohort due to statistical considerations. Each study cohort will open/close independently of other study cohorts. Once a study cohort reaches the prespecified number of participants, it will be closed to further enrollment, unless an expansion phase is planned.

The study is structured to allow for additional cohorts to be added as the study progresses. These additional study cohorts may be proposed by investigators, but requires approval by the Steering Committee in order to be added to the protocol.
