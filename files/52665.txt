A Study of Carboplatin, Cetuximab and RAD001 in Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the drug RAD001 in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, Carboplatin and Cetuximab. Because RAD001 has not been used in this combination before, it is not clear which dose will be best when used in combination.

The investigators will test the safety of RAD001 in combination with Carboplatin and Cetuximab and see what effects (good and/or bad) it has on your cancer, and find the highest dose of RAD001 that can be given without causing bad side effects. The doses of Carboplatin and Cetuximab will not be varied as both these drugs are considered to be part of the current standard of care for patients with your condition.

To Measure the Safety and Clinical Effectiveness of the Combination of Carboplatin, Cetuximab and RAD001 in Patients With Advanced (Recurrent or Metastatic) Head and Neck Cancer, This phase 1 clinical trial used a standard 3 + 3 design. Four dose levels of everolimus were planned to be evaluated, and the standard 3 + 3 design with dose de-escalation was used in the trial. Namely, 3 patients were assigned to starting dose level 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, the trial proceeded to the next dose level, and another cohort of 3 patients was enrolled. If at least 2 of the 3 patients experienced at least 1 DLT, then the dose level decreased; otherwise, if only 1 patient experienced DLT, then 3 more patients were enrolled at the same dose level. If none of the 3 additional patients experienced DLT, the dose was escalated; otherwise, the dose level decreased. Dose reduction continued until a dose level was reached at which 6 patients had been treated and at most 1 DLT was observed., Within the first 21 days of therapy
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Objective tumor responses were assessed every 2 cycles of chemotherapy with computed tomography or positron emission tomography/ computed tomography scans in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., The time of PFS was calculated as the time from study enrollment to the disease progression date, death date, or last contact, whichever came first, up to 25 months
