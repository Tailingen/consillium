Safety, Effectiveness and Operability of Using the New Tissue Containment System During Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy
The study is designed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and operability of performing in-bag cystectomy and morcellation with the new tissue containment system during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Premenopausal women, aged 18-45 undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy.
Ovary Neoplasm|Surgery
DEVICE: the New Tissue Containment System
The exposure rate, • Exposure is defined as "disruption of the device (using dye leak testing or water testing) or visible tissue dissemination"., End of study - approximately two years
The ovarian reserve function, The ovarian reserve function is reflected by the concentration of anti-mullerian hormone(AMH), Three months after the surgery|Mean procedure time, Mean procedure time will be measured by hour/minutes., Within one week after the surgery|Estimated blood loss during operation, Blood loss during operation will be measured by volume (mL), Within one week after the surgery|Rate of Intra- or post-operative complications, Intra or post complications rate (e.g. urinary, intestinal or nerve injury), Three months after the surgery|The patients' life quality postoperative: questionaire, The patients' life quality will be measured by The World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version（WHOQOL-BREF).The maximum value is 120 and the minimum is 0. The higher score means a better outcome., Three months after the surgery|The Surgery Task Load Index, The Surgery Task Load Index will be measured by questionaire. The maximum value is 120 and the minimum is 0. The higher score means a worse outcome., Within one week after the surgery|The rate of failure during in-bag cystectomy procedure, Failure is defined as the operator's inability to successfully insert and extract the device., End of study - approximately two years
