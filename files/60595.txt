Pucotenlimab Plus Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Rectal Cance(PUCRT)
Colorectal cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor, with rising incidence in China. Rectal cancer accounts for nearly half of new cases, and many patients are diagnosed at a locally advanced stage. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is the standard treatment, but only 20-30% achieve a complete response, with many experiencing recurrence or metastasis.

Immunotherapy, particularly PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, has shown promise in improving outcomes, especially in dMMR/MSI-H patients. However, most rectal cancer patients have MSS, where combining immunotherapy with nCRT has shown moderate success in clinical trials.

This project aims to explore the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor (pucotenlimab) combined with nCRT for locally advanced rectal cancer, potentially offering new treatment options.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Pucotenlimab
The rate of cCR, The cCR assessment is defined by the fulfillment of the following three criteria:

1. Digital rectal examination of the original tumor area shows normal findings, with no palpable tumor masses.
2. Endoscopy reveals white, flat mucosal scars accompanied by surrounding capillary ectasia, without evidence of tumor ulcers or nodules; mucosal biopsy results are negative for cancer cells.
3. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the rectum shows: On T2-weighted images, only low signal intensity (dark on T2) is present without intermediate T2 signal intensity, and there are no signs of enlarged lymph nodes. there is no visible signal on diffusion-weighted (DW) images., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks|The rate of pCR, The definition of pCR is that after surgery, in the pathological evaluation of the resected rectal cancer lesion, mesorectum, and regional lymph node samples, there are no visible tumor cells under the microscope. Tumor cells refer to viable tumor cells, excluding degenerated or necrotic cells. Pools of acellular mucin should not be assessed as residual tumor., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks
The rate of TRG0, complete regression, defined as no residual tumor cells in the primary tumor and regional LNs (ypT0N0), From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|The rate of R0 resection, R0 resection is defined as the removal of the rectal cancer lesion during surgery with no tumor cells present within 1 mm of the resection margins., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|Adverse events, The incidence, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and immune-related AEs (irAEs) were assessed in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 5.0)., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 3 years|Surgical safety, Surgical safety was defined as the rate of surgical complications, including anastomotic leak, pelvic sepsis, and wound infection, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 3 years|Event-Free Survival, Event-Free Survival (EFS) was defined as the period from the date of first treatment administration to the date of the first documented relevant event, where relevant events include disease progression that leads to inoperability, local recurrence or distant metastasis after surgery, and death due to any cause., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 3 years|Overall Survival, OS (Overall Survival) is defined as the period from the date of first treatment administration to the date of death due to any cause., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 3 years
