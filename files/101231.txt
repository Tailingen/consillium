The objective of this study is evaluate a program at a hospice involving activities designed to improve the site's National Quality Forum (NQF) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores. These scores are calculated by the hospice using existing patient satisfaction survey scores (HCAHPS). The institution quantifies their compliance with national quality metrics (NQF) and reports this existing data to the pharmacist providing counseling services to their patients. The pharmacist assesses for areas for improvement and provides additional counseling services to improve the continuity and quality of care. The pilot program is scheduled to launch April 2020 and the researchers will look to assess for changes in the NQF scores, HCAHPS scores, and time for their partnering pharmacy to refill the first set of prescriptions.
