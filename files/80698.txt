Study of a Retroviral Replicating Vector Given Intravenously to Patients Undergoing Surgery for Recurrent Brain Tumor
This is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Toca 511 administered intravenously to patients with recurrent or progressive Grade III or Grade IV Gliomas who have elected to undergo surgical removal of their tumor. Patients meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will receive an initial dose of Toca 511 administered as an intravenous, bolus injection, followed approximately 11 days later by an additional dose injected into the walls of the resection cavity at the time of planned tumor resection. Approximately 6 weeks later, patients will begin treatment with oral Toca FC, an antifungal agent, and repeated every 4 weeks. All patients enrolled in this study will be encouraged to participate in a continuation protocol that enables additional Toca FC administration and the collection of long-term safety and response data.
