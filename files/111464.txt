Overall response rate, The proportion of patients with at least one tumor scan of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST v1.1, 1 year

Up to now, there have been several prospective studies exploring the effectiveness of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with recurrent/ metastatic cervical cancer. The results showed that the overall objective response rate (ORR) was between 12.2% and 55.6%, and pembrolizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with advanced PD-L1-positive cervical cancer who experienced progression during or after chemotherapy. However, the evidence of using PD-1 inhibitors together with concurrent chemotheradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer is rare, so we initiated this single arm prospective phase II clinical study. The purpose is to explore the efficacy and tolerance of adding toripalimab simultaneously and subsequently to concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
