Cardiac Toxicity and Prognostic Value of New Echocardiographic Indicators in the Treatment of Primary Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferative plasma cell disease, which accounts for approximately 10% and ranks secondly of hematological malignancies in many countries. It is more common in the middle-aged and elderly, and currently cannot be healed.

2022 ESC Guidelines on cardio-oncology developed in collaboration with the European Hematology Association (EHA), the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Cardio-Oncology Society (IC-OS) showed the quantitative definition table for cancer related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT) related to cancer treatment, which is crucial for understanding and balancing the absolute benefits of cancer treatment before and during treatment, including the implementation of primary preventive treatment, optimization of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, dosage, frequency, and duration of tumor treatment, occurrence and severity of cardiovascular complications during treatment, as well as overall cumulative treatment received, time after treatment, and interactions with other cardiovascular diseases. However, current researches on adverse cardiac events in MM treatment mostly focus on follow-up of the therapeutic effects of certain drugs or comparison of short-term small sample ultrasound changes, but lacking systematic follow-up monitoring after treatment and the establishment of predictive models based on echocardiographic indicators.

This study aims to find the monitoring indicators in the early stage that are more sensitive in anti-tumor therapy for multiple myeloma patients by monitoring the changes in echocardiographic indicators after therapy. Based on the prognosis and adverse event occurrence in multiple myeloma patients, a predictive model for combining new ultrasound indicators with anti-tumor therapy for cardiac damage events and prognosis is established.

This study aims to find the monitoring indicators in the early stage that are more sensitive in anti-tumor therapy for multiple myeloma patients by monitoring the changes in echocardiographic indicators after therapy. The investigators plan to collect the clinical examination and echocardiographic images in the baseline and 3/6/12/36/60 months after treatment. After offline measurement, the investigators can get the changes of the structural and functional parameters, such as diameters, volumes, ejection fraction and strain of ventricle and atrium. Based on the prognosis and adverse event occurrence in multiple myeloma patients, a predictive model for combining new ultrasound indicators with anti-tumor therapy for cardiac damage events and prognosis is established.
