A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of ONO-4578 in Combination With Nivolumab and Chemotherapy in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With HER2-negative Unresectable Advanced or Recurrent Gastric Cancer (Including Esophagogastric Junction Cancer)
This study is to compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment with ONO-4578 in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy with those of the treatment with placebo in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve participants with HER2- negative unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer (including esophagogastric junction cancer).
