Robotic Bronchoscopy With Cone CT and Indocyanine Green to Aid Removal of Lung Lesions in Patients With Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases, REPLACING Study
This phase II trial studies the use of Ion robotic bronchoscope with a mobile computed tomography (CT) scanner to biopsy tumors and inject a fluorescent dye called indocyanine green to mark the tumor during surgery in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer or cancer that has spread to the lung (lung metastases). Sometimes small tumors or those that are not on the surface of the lung can be challenging to remove without making larger incisions. Injecting the dye, may help doctors see the tumor more easily, which may allow for smaller incisions and by being able to see the tumor, doctors may be better able to decide where to make the incisions in order to get all of the tumor out.

Number of successful procedures out of 50, Success is defined as the ability of the provider to navigate to the lesion and deploy the needle into the lesion using the three allotted scans to aid in targeting to the lesion (As evaluated by surgeon using cone beam computed tomography \[CT\])., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Number of repositions required to deploy needle into lesion, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Presence or absence of diagnostic tissue in sample, Evaluated using rapid cytology., Up to 2 years|Indocyanine green visualized during robotic pulmonary resection, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of cases that were begun as robotic or video-assisted that were converted to open in order to palpate nodule, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Closest margin on resected nodule pathology, Up to 2 years|Proximity of needle to the lesion on first deployment, Evaluated retrospectively by research fellow using cone beam CT images., through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the feasibility of using the Ion Endoluminal Platform (IEP; Intuitive, Sunnyvale, California \[CA\]) with the Cios Spin - a mobile cone-beam C - (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, Pennsylvania \[PA\], United States \[US\]) in the operating room setting.

OUTLINE:

During standard of care surgical resection, patients undergo robotic bronchoscopy and CT. Patients also receive indocyanine green via injection.
