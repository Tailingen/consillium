γδ T-PD-1 Ab Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This study intends to combine the advantages of γδ T cells and PD-1 monoclonal antibody to conduct an exploratory clinical study on the safety and efficacy of PD-1 antibody armored γδ T cells (γδ T-PD-1 Ab cells) in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor

Safety evaluation: Incidence of Adverse events (AEs), Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., up to 60 weeks|Safety evaluation: Dose limited toxicity (DLTs), The incidence, characteristic and severity of DLTs will be recorded and assessed., up to 60 weeks|Safety evaluation: Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), MTD or clinical recommended dose will be recorded and evaluated., up to 60 weeks
Efficacy evaluation: Objective Response Rate(ORR), Objective response rate will be assessed by investigators., up to 15months|Efficacy evaluation: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate will be assessed by investigators., up to 15months|Efficacy evaluation: Progress Free Survival(PFS), Observation for progression-free survival (PFS) will be recorded until 15 months after the start of 1st cycle of treatment., up to 15months|Efficacy evaluation: Overall Survival (OS), Observation for overall survival (OS) will be recorded until 15 months after the start of 1st cycle of treatment., up to 15months
This is a single-center, single-arm, phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of γδ T-PD-1 Ab cells in patients with advanced solid tumors without standard treatment. A typical 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used to determine the optimal dose level of γδ T-PD-1 Ab cells based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The initial infusion dose level will start from 3×10\^7/kg to 3×10\^8/kg in every 2 weeks.
