A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Glumetinib and Docetaxel（Albumin Bound）Verse Docetaxel for the Treatment of MET-overexpressed Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study consists of Stage 1 (including dose escalation and dose expansion) and Stage 2 (randomized controlled study). The main purpose of Stage 1 is to preliminarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of glumetinib Tablets and Docetaxel for Injection（Albumin Bound）(HB1801) in the treatment of MET-overexpressed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); The main purpose of Stage 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of glumetinib tablets and HB1801 compared to glumetinib tablets monotherapy or docetaxel in the treatment of MET-expressed NSCLC.
