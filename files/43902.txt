Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Stress Study of Pituitrin in Laparoscopic Hysteromyoma Surgery
This study is about the effect of dexmedetomidine to the stress of pituitrin in laparoscopic hysteromyoma surgery. It is well known that pituitrin has been widespread used in the laparoscopic hysteromyoma surgery. Pituitrin includes oxytocin and vasopressin. Vasopressin increase body stress reaction through hypothalamic pituitary adrenal(HPA) axis. The HPA axis has has main role to the body stress reaction. Dexmedetomidine can inhibit the stress responses mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore,the effect of dexmedetomidine to the stress of pituitrin in laparoscopic hysteromyoma surgery is worth to be studied.
