TumorGlow Intraoperative Molecular Imaging (IMI)
This is a Phase 1/2 study in patients presenting with any solid tumor and/or diseased tissue even benign nodules presumed to be resectable and at risk for recurrence on pre-operative assessment who are considered to be good surgical candidates to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the image-guided surgery using indocyanine green for intramolecular imaging of solid tumors.
Tumor, Solid
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
Cohort 1: Determine the safety of indocyanine green (all tumor types combined), Type, frequency, severity, and attribution of AEs/SAEs (all tumor types combined)., Up to 5 days|Cohort 1: Identify optimal dosing of indocyanine green before surgery, and camera combination (tumor type-specific), Dosing of indocyanine green, and camera combination with the highest tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) (tumor type-specific). The minimum acceptable TBR value is 2., Up to 5 days|Cohort 1: Identify optimal timing of indocyanine green before surgery, and camera combination (tumor type-specific), Timing of indocyanine green, and camera combination with the highest tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) (tumor type-specific). The minimum acceptable TBR value is 2., Up to 5 days|Cohort 2: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of indocyanine green (tumor type-specific), Nodule/lesion-level and subject-level sensitivity and specificity of TumorGlow (tumor type-specific).

* Sensitivity of indocyanine green = TP/(TP+FN) = (# that fluoresce and are cancer)/(# that are cancer)
* Specificity of indocyanine green = TN/(TN+FP) = (# that not cancer and do not fluoresce)/(# that are not cancer), Up to 5 days|Cohort 2: Confirm the efficacy of indocyanine green used with Near Infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging as measured by Clinically Significant Event (CSE) rate (tumor type-specific), Clinically Significant Event (CSE) rate (tumor type-specific). A CSE includes any of the following event:

* One or more primary nodule (cancerous or non-cancerous) not detected under normal light and/or palpation but is detected by imaging,
* One or more cancerous synchronous lesion not detected under normal light and/or palpation but is detected by imaging,
* The identification of a cancer positive margin that fluoresces within (less than or equal to) 5 mm of the surgical margin., Up to 5 days
Cohort 1: Provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of indocyanine green (or TumorGlow) for identifying cancerous areas (tumor type-specific), Nodule/lesion-level and subject-level sensitivity and specificity of indocyanine green (or TumorGlow) for identifying cancerous areas (tumor type-specific)., Up to 5 days|Cohort 1: Provide preliminary estimate of the efficacy of indocyanine green for locating additional cancers and missed surgical margins as measured by CSE rate (tumor type-specific), Clinically Significant Event (CSE) rate (tumor type-specific)., Up to 5 days|Cohort 2: Confirm the safety of indocyanine green (all tumor types combined), Type, frequency, severity, and attribution of AEs/SAEs (all tumor types combined)., Up to 5 days
