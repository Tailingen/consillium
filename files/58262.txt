Comparison of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA®) and Tracheal Tube in Modified Radical Mastectomy on Breast Cancer
Airway management in anesthesia is critical to guarantee appropriate treatment of possible respiratory complications and successful operative practice. LMA® is an alternative to tracheal tube in some surgeries like as mastectomy on breast cancer. Given no need using muscular relaxants in mastectomy, the investigators hypothesized that LMA® would be a superior manner in airway management in radical modified mastectomy on breast cancer than the tracheal tube, and the LMA® might produce less influence on patients' circulatory homeostasis, and easier to be placed before operation.
