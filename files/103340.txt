The Phase III Study of Icaritin Versus Sorafenib in PD-L1 Positive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Subjects
The primary efficacy index of this study is to compare the OS of the two groups.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: Icaritin|DRUG: Sorafenib Tosylate Tablets
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to died from any cause. For the subjects who failed to visit, deletion is performed on the final date of knowing the survival of the subjects, for subjects who still survive, deletion is performed on the data expiration date., 1-2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the date from randomization to the first radiographic record of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). See the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the definition of PFS deletion rule., 1-2 years|Time to progress（TTP）, TTP is defined as the date from randomization to the first radiographic record of disease progression, see the Statistical Analysis Plan(SAP) for the definition of TTP deletion rule., 1-2 years|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving optimal overall efficacy such as CR or partial remission (PR)., 1-2 years|Overall disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving optimal overall efficacy such as CR, PR or stable disease (SD)., 1-2 years|Assessment on Quality of life 1, Quality of life (QOL) changes: Quality of life scores are assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 and compared with baseline values., 1-2 years|Assessment on Quality of life 2, Quality of life (QOL) changes: Quality of life scores are assessed with EORTCQLQ-HCC-18 and compared with baseline values., 1-2 years
Biomarker analysis of proteome level (Immunohistochemical method), Baseline expression or expression changes of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPAB1) and interleukin -6 (IL-6) and so on., 1-2 years|Genome level (DNA, mRNA, miRNA) biomarker analysis, Genetic variation(Liver cancer driver genes and hotspot gene mutations, such as IDH1/2, JAK2/3, PD-L1/2), expression levels of oncogenes and immune related genes(Gene copy number and RNA expression level) and epigenetics cohort analysis, 1-2 years
Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecular compound which is high selective ERa36 modulators ,the preclinical PK\&PD and toxicity studies showed it can inhibit the growth of HCC cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, combining clinical data perhaps it will be a very promising new drug to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting this nongenomic pathway. Shenogen decided to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Icaritin and to explore potential gene targets for treating HCC.

The results of phase I study showed Icaritin has good safety and tolerance. The biological availability of Icaritin after meal is high and the half-life is relatively short.

The phase Ib study enrolled 28 subjects. Among the 18 HCC subjects, 12 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 600 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30 minutes, 6 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 800 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30 minutes. The results showed that in the 600mg group there are 12 HCC patients whose therapeutic efficacy is evaluable now, one case of PR (10%), 5 cases of SD (50%) and 4 cases of PD (40%) were observed.Safety data showed that totally 24 AEs are probably related to investigational drug. Among them, 19 AEs are grade I, 5 AEs are grade II, no grade III or above AE.
