EQ-5D-consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ5D-VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.

Study KTE-C19-102 enrolled participants with r/r MCL who have been treated with up to 5 prior regimens including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. However, to fulfill FDA Postmarketing Requirement, Cohort 3 is added to the study. It will include participants with r/r MCL who have been treated with up to 5 prior regimens but have not received prior therapy with a BTKi.

The primary analysis in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 is already completed. Data for Cohort 3 will be analyzed separately. Therefore, details for Cohort 3 were registered separately (NCT04880434) on ClinicalTrials.gov as this cohort will not be part of the main study analysis.

After the end of KTE-C19-102, subjects who received an infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells will complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments in a separate long-term follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968
