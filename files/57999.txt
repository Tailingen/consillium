The Application of Glucose CEST MR Imaging in Brain Tumor
Recently, natural D-glucose was suggested as a potential biodegradable contrast agent. The feasibility of using D-glucose for dynamic perfusion imaging was explored to detect malignant brain tumors based on blood brain barrier breakdown. Our study try to evaluate the feasibility of dynamic glucose enhanced(DGE) magnetic resonance imaging（MRI）in brain tumor, which based on D-glucose weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (gluceoCEST).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
DRUG: d-glucose
CEST value of tumor lesion including tumor core/ necrosis/ cysis/ edema, the CEST value of tumor core and necrosis might higher than white matter, 1 week
methods： Brain tumor patients were recruited. Time-resolved glucose signal changes were detected using chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) MRI. Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI was used to measure tissue response to an intravenous bolus of D-glucose. During the dynamic glucose scan, a brief hyperglycemic state was established by intravenous infusion of hospital-grade D50 glucose (D50, 25 g of dextrose in 50 mL of water sterile solution), followed by 20 mL of saline solution in 1 arm. The glucose infusion was performed using a power injector at an infusion rate of 0.2 mL/s, corresponding to total infusion times of 250 seconds. Performing contrast enhancement based on Gd-DTPA in 30 minutes later, which was used for comparison as golden standard.

The area of hyperintensity will be measured, which represents the area of brain tumor.

Differential test and Consistency analysis were used for statistical analysis.
