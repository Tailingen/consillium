Prevalence and Incidence of Central Airway Obstruction in Advanced Lung Cancer
Lung cancer may cause central airway obstruction through several different mechanisms (invasion by the primary tumor, invasion by metastatic lymph nodes, airway metastasis).

The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence at the time of diagnosis, the incidence at 1 year from the diagnosis, and the predictors of central airway obstruction associated with advanced lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
Incidence of central airway obstruction, The incidence will be measured over a 12 month period after diagnosis (or over the life span from diagnosis to death in patients who die before 1 year from the diagnosis), 12 months
Predictor variables associated with the presence/occurrence of central airway obstruction, 12 months|Prevalence of central airway obstruction, The prevalence of central airway obstruction will be evaluated at the time of diagnosis, 1 day
