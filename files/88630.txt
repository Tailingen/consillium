A Safety and Tolerability of Circumferential Anal Canal Radiofrequency Ablation For Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia
Assess the safety, feasibility, and patient tolerability of circumferential radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to the anal canal for patients with anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). Patients will have AIN with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the RFA will be applied using the Barrx™ Ablation System.
Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN)|High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL)
DEVICE: Radiofrequency Ablation (Barrx™)
Related Adverse Events, Adverse event : Device relationship - Definite, Probable, Possible, Within 12 months post RFA
Subject Tolerability: Post -Ablation Anal Pain, Median post-ablation anal pain from 10 patients' survey after RFA treatment. Anal pain scale range: 0-10 (minimum pain=0, maximum pain=10), within 4 weeks post RFA|Quality of Life Assessment: Subject Score for Worry About Anal Canal Condition, Median from subject scores for worry about anal canal condition at 0-2 weeks prior to RFA treatment and after 9-12 months post RFA. Median scale range: 0-10 (minimum concern=0, maximum concern=10), 0-2 weeks Prior RFA and after 9-12 months post RFA
