Molecular Profiling of Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers
This is a study where fresh tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected from patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who will be undergoing 1st line therapy with gemcitabine or fluorouracil (5-FU) regimens to see how useful it is to look for changes and characteristics in genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and functioning of the cells) and the genes within the tumour to find characteristics that may be useful in choosing treatments for patients in the future.
Biliary Tract Cancer
PROCEDURE: Fresh tumor tissue biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood draw|PROCEDURE: Archival tumor tissue collection
Number of participants with gene testing data available at 8 weeks from baseline tumor biopsy., 8 Weeks
Disease control rate, 4 years|Progression-free survival rate, 4 years|Overall survival rate, 4 years|Genomic predictors of response to chemotherapy identified, 4 years|Germline mutations of hereditary risk factors, 4 years|Potential predictive biomarkers of response to treatment such as BRCA, PALB2 and ATM mutations., 4 years
Changes (mutations) in genes have been shown to be an important characteristic in cancers. Looking at differences in genes in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer and comparing this information with response to their initial chemotherapy treatment may help to learn which treatments may be better for certain patients after initial treatment.
