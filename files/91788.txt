An Open-Label Phase II Study of Nivolumab or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab in Adult Participants With Progessive/ Recurrent Meningioma
This research study is studying targeted immunotherapies as a possible treatment for recurrent meningioma. The names of the study interventions involved in this study are nivolumab and ipilimumab.
Meningiomas
DRUG: Nivolumab - 240 mg|DRUG: Ipilimumab - 1 mg/kg|DRUG: Nivolumab - 480 mg|DRUG: Nivolumab - 3 mg/kg|RADIATION: External Beam RT
Both Cohorts: Progression-Free Survival At Six Months Following Initiation Of Study Therapy, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity for single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab following radiation therapy (cohort 2) among patients with recurrent/progressive grade I, II or III meningioma., 6 months
Both Cohorts: Median Progression-Free Survival, To evaluate additional measures of anti-tumor activity of single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2) among patients with recurrent/progressive grade I, II or III meningioma, 2 years|Both Cohorts: Median Overall Survival, To evaluate additional measures of anti-tumor activity of single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2) among patients with recurrent/progressive grade I, II or III meningioma, 2 years|Both Cohorts: Objective Radiologic Response Rate, To evaluate additional measures of anti-tumor activity of single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2) among patients with recurrent/progressive grade I, II or III meningioma, 2 years|Both Cohorts: Number of participants with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., 1.2.1 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2) among patients with recurrent/progressive grade I, II or III meningioma, 2 years
Evaluate Circulating Immune Cell Subsets and Cytokines as Systemic Immune Correlative Markers, Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), the absolute CD4 T cell count will be determined and phenotyping of T effector cells (CD4+CD69+) and T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) with determination of absolute number of naive, effector and regulatory T cells as well as percents/ratios of total population will also be determined. Soluble factors such as cytokines, chemokines, soluble receptors and antibodies to tumor antigens will be measured via commercially available multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), 2 years|Evaluate Archival Tumor Expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 Expressing Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, To evaluate correlative biomarkers of systemic immune response among patients with recurrent/progressive grade II or III meningioma treated with single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2), 2 years|Evaluate Archival Tumor Expression of immune gene expression signature utilizing the Nanostring assay, To evaluate correlative biomarkers of systemic immune response among patients with recurrent/progressive grade II or III meningioma treated with single-agent nivolumab (cohort 1) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab after radiation therapy (cohort 2), 2 years|Assess mean changes from baseline in the level of function score for each domain of the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale, Evaluation Of Neurologic Function As Measured By The NANO Scale., 2 years|Determine difference in tumor growth rates before and after treatment that would allow detection of treatment efficacy., Evaluation of change in tumor growth rate as measured by volumetric analysis, 2 years|Determine if there are pre-treatment predictors of treatment response using radiomic analysis, Evaluation of change in tumor growth rate as measured by volumetric analysis, 2 years
This research is a Phase II clinical trial, which means it will test the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab alone (Cohort 1) or in combination with ipilimumab (Cohort 2). Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (types of human protein) that work to stop tumor cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is trying to have the body's own immune system work against tumor cells.

Nivolumab and ipilimumab have both been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that these interventions may help to stop Meningioma cells from growing.

Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat other types of cancers, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for this type of cancer. The FDA has not approved the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for your specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses.
