Sintilimab Combined With Bevacizumab for Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a prospective phase II clinical study to assess the efficacy of Sintilimab combined with Bevacizumab for driving gene-negative, asymptomatic brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer by intracranial ORR(iORR),also iPFS,ORR and PFS.The safety and tolerability is evaluated as well.
