A Study of Elacestrant Versus Standard Endocrine Therapy in Women and Men With ER+,HER2-, Early Breast Cancer With High Risk of Recurrence
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of elacestrant versus standard endocrine therapy in participants with node-positive, Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor-2 negative (HER2-) early breast cancer with high risk of recurrence.
