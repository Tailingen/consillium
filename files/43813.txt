Anti-Androgens and Cabazitaxel in Defining Complete Response in Prostatectomy (ACDC Trial)
This study evaluates the use of chemotherapy with cabazitaxel in addition to abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide in neoadjuvant setting prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with high-risk prostate carcinoma. Half of the participants will receive treatment with abiraterone acetate, prednisone, leuprolide, and cabazitaxel, while the other half will receive only abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide.
