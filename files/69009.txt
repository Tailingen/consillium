All scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. For the functional and the global QoL scales, a higher score indicates better health. For the symptom scales, a higher score indicates more symptom burden.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capmatinib in combination with spartalizumab in treatment naive patients with EGFR wild-type, ALK rearrangement negative advanced NSCLC, harboring METÎ”ex14 mutations.

A run-in part (Part 1) was conducted to determine the anti-tumor activity and safety of capmatinib in combination with spartalizumab. Upon review of safety data and confirmation of anti-tumor activity in Part 1, the randomized part (Part 2) was planned to be initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of capmatinib plus spartalizumab to capmatinib plus placebo.

Combined treatment of METÎ”ex14 mutated NSCLC with capmatinib and spartalizumab was expected to result in improved efficacy compared to each single agent due to direct targeting of an oncogenic driver (MET) as well as more efficient stimulation of an anti-tumor immune response than with PD-1 blockade alone.

The study enrollment was halted on 28-Jul-2021 per sponsor's decision. The enrollment halt decision was based on lack of tolerability observed in capmatinib and spartalizumab combination treatment in the run-in part (Part 1) of the trial.

Following the study enrollment halt during Part 1 (Run in Part), Part 2 was not initiated.

Immediately following the enrollment halt:

* All ongoing subjects were discontinued from spartalizumab treatment and continue to receive single agent capmatinib
* Enrolled subjects who had not started study treatment were to receive capmatinib single agent treatment from the start
