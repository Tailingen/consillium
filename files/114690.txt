A Dose Finding Study of ZW49 in Patients With HER2-Positive Cancers
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dosage (RD) of ZW49, the investigational agent under study, and to assess the safety and tolerability of ZW49. Eligible patients include those with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic HER2-expressing cancers.
HER2-expressing Cancers
DRUG: ZW49
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants who experienced a DLT. DLTs are events that occur following administration of any amount of ZW49 and are considered related to ZW49 per the investigator. DLTs will include only events considered related to ZW49., Up to 4 weeks|Incidence of adverse events, Number of participants who experienced an adverse event, Up to 7 months|Incidence of lab abnormalities, Number of participants who experienced a maximum severity of Grade 3 or higher post-baseline laboratory abnormality, including either hematology and chemistry. Grades are defined using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0., Up to 7 months|Incidence of electrocardiogram (ECG) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) abnormalities, Number of participants who experienced an abnormal ECG or LVEF, Up to 7 months|Incidence of dose reductions of ZW49, Number of doses reduced and number of participants who require a dose reduction, Up to 7 months
Serum concentrations of ZW49, End of infusion concentration, maximum serum concentration, and trough concentration of ZW49, Up to 7 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Number of participants who develop ADAs, Up to 7 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Number of participants who achieved a best response of either complete or partial response during treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 6 months|Disease control rate, Number of participants who achieved a best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease during treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 6 months|Duration of response, Median duration of response (in months) and range (minimum, maximum), Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival, Median progression-free survival (in months) and range (minimum, maximum), Up to 2 years
The study will use a 3+3 dose-escalation study design to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW49 and to determine the MTD or RD of ZW49 for further study. Selected expansion cohorts will be subsequently opened based upon Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommendation and sponsor approval to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW49 at the MTD or RD and to assess preliminary anti-tumor activity.
