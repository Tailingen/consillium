Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Preliminary Efficacy Study of AC0010MA in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
AC0010MA is a new, irreversible, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor. Aim at local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation or T790M drug-resistant mutation. The molecular mechanism: by irreversible combining the EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site of cell, selectively suppress the activities of EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, block the signal transduction pathway of EGFR and inhibit the function of ras/raf/MAPK downstream, thus block the tumor cell growth by EGFR induction, and promotes apoptosis. AC0010MA Maleate Capsules has three characters: 1. Irreversible binding to EGFR; 2. Effectively suppresses the tumor cell with EGFR mutant while has no suppression to EGFR wild-type cell; 3. Efficient suppress the tumor cell with EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation.

DRUG: AC0010MA
Safety and tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AC0010MA determined by incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), To determine the safety and tolerability and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AC0010MA by incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) and clinical lab abnormalities occurring within the first 28 days of treatment., Within the first 28 days of treatment.
Evaluation of tumor response and duration of response of AC0010MA ((objective response rate, ORR), To characterize tumor response (objective response rate, ORR) and duration of response of AC0010MA as a criterion for further development of AC0010MA in this patient population., within the time frame of every 8 weeks (2 cycles) for up to 3 years|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of AC0010MA, To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I|Time to Cmax, To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I|Terminal half-life (t1/2), To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I|Volume of distribution (V/F), To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I|Plasma Concentration (CL/F), To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter of AC0010MA, Blood samples will be collected at pre-treatment, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h post-treatment on Days 1, 8, and 28 in the first treatment cycle (QD and BID) in Phase I
