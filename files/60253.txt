Genotyping of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The logical next step is to integrate molecular profiling into the care of all patients with NSCLC.

frequency of individual genotyping, To determine the frequency of individual genotyping in cancer cells of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have participated or will commence the clinical trial., 2 months
determine the frequency by DNA mass spectrometry, To determine the frequency with which molecular profiling of a NSCLC patient's tumor by DNA mass spectrometry yields a target against which there is approved or investigational therapeutic regimen., 2 months|response rate, To determine the response rate according to RECIST, progression-free, and overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC whose therapy is selected by molecular profile., 1 year
NSCLC is an area of oncology in which clinicians are beginning to use specific tumor-associated molecular aberrations to assign and/or prioritize targeted therapies for patients. At this early stage, multiple hurdles remain before molecular profiling becomes a routine part of thoracic oncology practice. In particular, to develop specific targeted therapies for patients whose tumors harbor rare mutations, it will be important to identify appropriate candidates, design the appropriate trials, and execute the trials with adequate numbers to achieve the necessary endpoints. Implementation will facilitate realization of the promise of molecularly tailored therapy, which could lead to more effective treatments with fewer side effects.
