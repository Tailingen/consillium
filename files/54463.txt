Second Line ERIbulin Followed by CApecitabine or the Reverse Sequence in HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
GIM22-ERICA is a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of two different strategies in HER2 negative MBC treatment. The study will include MBC patients with histologically documented HER2 negative disease, who have progressed to one prior regimen for metastatic disease and are eligible for a second-line chemotherapy with either eribulin or capecitabine.

This study design should answer to different questions:

* What is the correct placement of Eribulin in the context of a long term treatment strategy?
* Is an early use of Eribulin the best approach for MBC pts treatment?
* May early use of Eribulin impact on subsequent treatment outcomes?

The correlated biomarkers analysis, evaluating angiogenic, epithelial and mesenchymal markers should confirm the results observed in preclinical studies ad support the clinical findings. Liquid biopsies and ctDNA evaluation could help to monitor the course of the disease and to identify novel biomarkers of drug resistance.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin Mesylate|DRUG: Capecitabine
Total Progression Free Survival (PFS-T), Total-progression-free survival (PFS-T) is defined as the time elapsed between randomization and the first event among the following:

* the date of progression after the second treatment on study -whichever the second treatment will be according to intention-to-treat (eventual departures from treatments planned in the protocol will be described)
* the date of death if death occurs before second progression

Patients who are alive and who do not fall into any of the above categories at the end of the study will be censored on the date of the last information on vital status., 62 months
Overall Survival from the date of randomization, This is defined as the time elapsed from the first day of 2nd line therapy and death, 62 months|Health-related Quality of Life (QoL), Assessment will be performed by using EORTC QoL questionnaires (QlQ C30 and specific EORTC QlQ BR23), At screening and then every 8 weeks (including at the time of disease progression/s)|Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR: proportion of patients obtaining complete response or partial response or stable disease \>= 6 months):

* in second line;
* In third line;
* In second and/or third line., 62 months|Post Progression Survival (PPS), This is defined as the time elapsed from disease progression after 3rd line of therapy and death;, 62 months
Biomarker analysis on patients' blood samples, * Tumor Circulating DNA (ctDNA)
* Angiogenetic markers (VEGF, bFGF)
* EMT biomarkers (E- Cadherin, N-Cadherin, Vimentin, TGF-beta)
* Leukocyte-lymphocyte subpopulations
* Cytokines, Baseline and 62 months
Patients who are considered eligible for the study treatment, will be randomly allocated within the two study arms.

ARM A:

* Second line Eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, 8 every 21 days
* third line Capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 orally twice per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days

ARM B:

* Second line Capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 orally twice per day on days 1 to 14 every 21 days
* Third line Eribulin 1.23 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, 8 every 21 days

Study treatment will be continued until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator's decision or patient refusal of further treatment.
