Discovery of Biomarkers for Intrinsic Radiation Sensitivity in Cancer Patients
Patients with cancers that are sensitive to radiotherapy treatment and/or patients who have experienced severe acute/ late side effects to radiotherapy will be recruited to the study. Blood and/or matched tumour-normal tissue pairs will be collected. Blood and/or tissue samples will be processed and studied for genetic and biochemical markers that have potential to be used for predicting sensitivity to radiation.

To identify genes or molecular pathways that are associated with radiation sensitivity in blood and tissue samples, Whole exome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays, Blood is taken at informed consent; tissue is from archived sample|Change in immune profile of blood and tissue after radiation, Mass cytometry using CyTOF technology will be used to detect the immune cell population, Blood is taken at informed consent; tissue is from archived sample|To identify proteins that are associated with radiation sensitivity in tissue samples, Immunohistochemistry will be used to detect protein expression, Tissue is from archived sample|To identify RNA expression pathways that are associated with radiation sensitivity in blood and tissue samples, RNA sequencing, Blood is taken at informed consent; tissue is from archived sample
