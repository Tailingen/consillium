Radiofrequency-Guided Localization in Patients With Abnormal Breast Tissue Undergoing Lumpectomy
This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the radiofrequency-guided localization in patients with abnormal breast tissue undergoing lumpectomy (a type of breast-sparing surgery). The radiofrequency identification localization system consists of an implantable radiofrequency identification tag and a hand-held radiofrequency reader to mark abnormal breast tissue before surgery and later surgically retrieve them. Radiofrequency-guided localization may make it easier to find and remove abnormal breast tissue during lumpectomy.
Breast Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Lumpectomy|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency-Guided Localization
Localization success, defined as the surgical target visualized in the removed specimen AND the RFID tag removed from the patient's breast, Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including total numbers, percentages, means, and proportions., At time of surgery
Feedback solicited from the radiologist and surgeon, Feedback solicited from the radiologist and surgeon will be summarized using qualitative methods. Each questionnaire will be reviewed for both positive and negative responses and summarized., Up to 12 months after lumpectomy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To obtain human clinical data in order to demonstrate that the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) Localization System performs as intended as a localization device for marking and retrieving a surgical target in the breast.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To solicit feedback from the radiologists and surgeons regarding the process and use of the RFID system.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo radiofrequency-guided localization comprising RFID tag placement before lumpectomy and interactive detection of tag using RFID reader during lumpectomy.
