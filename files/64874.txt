This trial is a prospective, open-label, investigator-initiated clinical study in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of T3011 herpes virus injection alone or in combination with toripalimab and regorafenib in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. In this study, the lead-in period of T3011 and the combination therapy period were designed, and the 3+3 dose escalation design was carried out in the lead-in period.
