Sequential Chemo-Radioimmunotherapy Followed by Autologous Transplantation for Patients With Untreated Advanced Stage Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma, with only about 3,000 cases diagnosed per year. MCL is considered a difficult cancer to treat. This study is being done to better understand how to treat MCL.

maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of HIDAC. For this study the MTD will be the dose at which no more than one grade 3 CNS toxic event (defined by CTCAE 4.0 as severe neurologic symptoms limiting self care ADLs') up to two weeks following HIDAC occurs among a 6 patient cohort. Phase I, 1 year|3 year Event Free Survival (EFS), from 67% (historical control) to 80 % in all patients. The EFS interval starts at enrollment date, and an event is defined as death from any cause or progression of disease. Patients who have completed the ASCT but elect to be removed from the study or lost to follow-up by the end of the third year will be counted as events as well. Phase II, 3 years
