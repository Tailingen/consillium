ExoDx Prostate Evaluation in Prior Negative Prostate Biopsy Setting
The study is designed to confirm the performance of the ExoDx Prostate test in prior negative biopsy patients now presenting for a repeat prostate biopsy.

Note: ExoDx Prostate test results are collected for correlation to biopsy results and are not disclosed to the physician or study subject.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ExoDx Prostate
Correlation of the ExoDx Prostate test results with the outcome of prostate biopsies in a prior negative repeat biopsy patient cohort., 6 months
Primary Endpoint:

Evaluate the correlation of the ExoDx Prostate test results with the outcome of prostate biopsies in a prior negative repeat biopsy patient cohort.

Secondary Endpoints (exploratory):

1. Evaluate the clinical performance of the ExoDx Prostate test at the cut-point of 15.6 defined for the initial biopsy patient cohort.
2. Associate ExoDx Prostate test results with other ancillary studies including the use of radiographic imaging (e.g. multiparametric MRI).
3. Evaluate the correlation of ExoDx Prostate as a function of risk. It is known that a higher ExoDx Prostate score correlates to a higher risk of finding prostate cancer, including HGPC, upon biopsy.
4. Evaluate ExoDx Prostate with and without inclusion of standard of care parameters such as PSA, ethnicity, DRE, age and family history.
