PET Imaging of Cancer Patients Using 124I-PUH71: A Pilot Study
The purpose of this study is to see how a new drug, named PUH71, accumulates in the different parts of the body \& inside tumors and how long PUH71 lasts in the blood, when given to study participants in tiny amounts. The results of this study will help researchers (1) plan how they will use PUH71 as an experimental new drug (at much-higher doses) for the treatment of cancer, in clinical trials; and (2) know whether PUH71 might be used as a drug for detecting tumors with scanner machines.
