Induction Chemotherapy Combined With Camrelizumab in Locoregionally Advanced Hypopharyngeal Cancer
The study is a single center phase II trial. The purpose is to investigate both the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 antibody Followed by chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer.

DRUG: Camrelizumab
Progression-free Survival, PFS, Defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever happens first. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive and progression free. Patients not having an event will be censored at the date last seen alive., 1 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the portion of patients with a tumor size reduction of a predefined amount for a minimum time period. Tumor response will be measured according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1., 1 year|Duration of Response（DoR）, Response duration is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression., 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk or been stable for a certain period of time, including cases of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive. Patients remaining alive throughout the duration of the study will have their survival time censored on the date last seen alive., 1 year|Adverse events (AE), Adverse events during the treatment period using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0)., 1 year
