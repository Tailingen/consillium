The Study of Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Phase I part, Primary objective: the maximum tolerated dose of S-1 in the SLOG regimen Secondary objectives: the dose-limiting toxicity of the regimen Phase II part, Primary objective: Overall tumor response rate (by RECIST criteria) Secondary objectives: Disease control rate (Objective response rate (ORR) + stable disease â‰§ 16 weeks), Time to tumor progression, Progression-free survival, Overall survival ,Safety profile, Biomarker study
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: S-1,Leucovorin,Oxaliplatin,Gemcitabine
to determine the following items in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receiving SLOG, Patients will be entered in cohorts of three. In any dose level of S-1, if none develops DLT as listed after the first two doses of SLOG chemotherapy, another cohort of 3 patients will be accrued to the next dose level. If at any time two or more patients develop DLT at the same dose level, the dose escalation will be terminated, and the prior dosage level will be considered the MTD., one year
to evaluate the following items in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receiving SLOG treatment,, 9.2.1 Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used to determine the target patient number for the phase II part of this study. Using the approach, we test a null hypothesis that the true-response probability is less than an uninteresting level (p0) of 25% against the alternative hypothesis that the true response probability is at least as great as a target level (p1) of 40%. Response probabilities less than 25% will be considered inactive while response probabilities greater than 40% will be called highly effective., one year
Phase I: 2\~24 patients Phase II: Considering a design with p0 = 0.25 and p1 = 0.40 for which error is 0.10 and errors is 0.20, these constraints can be met with a two-stage Simon's design of 25 patients in the first stage and 27 patients in the second stage.
