Investigating the Effects of Different Incision Types on Aesthetic Outcomes and Incision-related Complications After Breast Reconstruction Surgery
1. DATA COLLECTION: About 300 cases of female patients who underwent breast reconstruction at Hubei Cancer Hospital(HBCH) between February 2013 and June 2023 were retrospectively collected. The incision was defined as the mastectomy incision and was grouped by the commonly used inframammary fold incision, lateral chest wall incision, circumareolar incision, and radial incision. The incidence of postoperative incision-related complications was recorded for different incision types;
2. DATA ORGANIZATION: Patients were divided into subgroups based on history of previous breast surgery, location and size of the lump, retention of the nipple-areola complex, timing of reconstruction, and type of the implant. The correlation of each subgroup with incision design is discussed;
3. FOLLOW-UP: Collected cases were followed up by telephone to complete the Breast-Q questionnaire (aesthetic score);
4. DATA ANALYSIS: The incidence of postoperative incision-related complications and aesthetic scores for different incision types were statistically analyzed.
Breast Neoplasm Female
PROCEDURE: incision type
Breast-Q Version 2.0 Reconstruction Module, The questionnaire was filled in by the subjects, and the researchers assigned scores according to the results of the questionnaire. scores of the following three parts were recorded according to the Breast-Q Version 2.0Â© reconstruction module, with higher scores indicating better aesthetic results, Psychosocial Well-being (0 to 100), Sexual Well-being (0 to 100), Satisfaction with Breasts (0 to 100), three months after surgery; six months after surgery; 1 year after surgery
Incision-Related Complications, The researchers followed up the patients closely after surgery, and recorded the incidence of different postoperative incision complications of the subjects, such as infection, seroma, incision dehiscence, and capsular contracture., within 1 year after surgery
