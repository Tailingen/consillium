a Study of QL1706 or QL1604 in Patients With Limited-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer After Chemoradiotherapy.
The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 versus QL1604 monotherapy as consolidation treatment in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) who have not experienced disease progression after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy.

QL1706 (Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab) is a single bifunctional MabPair product against PD-1 and CTLA-4. QL1604 is a monoclonal antibody against PD-1.
