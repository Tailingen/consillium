Phase III Study of Envafolimab Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Resectable Stage III NSCLC
This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of envafolimab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy versus placebo plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy in subjects with resectable stage IIIA and IIIB (N2) NSCLC. Primary study endpoints are MPR rate assessed by BIPR and EFS assessed by BIRC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Envalfolimab subcutaneously injected+Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy intravenous injection|DRUG: placebo subcutaneously injected +Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy intravenous injection
MPR by BIPR, MPR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having â‰¤10% viable tumor cells in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (evaluated by BIPR), Up to 5 years|EFS by BIRC, EFS is defined as the time from randomization until the occurrence of events leading to inoperable disease progression, post-operative disease progression (BIRC assessment based on RECIST 1.1) or recurrence/metastasis, or death from any cause., Up to 5 years
pCR, pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having an absence of residual invasive cancer in resected lung specimens and lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy, assessed by BIPR;, Up to 5 years|DFS, DFS is defined as the time from post-surgery to radiographic disease progression, local or distant recurrence, or death from any cause, assessed by BIRC;, Up to 5 years|OS, OS is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause.;, Up to 5 years|EFS, EFS is defined as the time from randomization until the occurrence of events leading to inoperable disease progression, post-operative disease progression or recurrence/metastasis, or death from any cause., assessed by investigator;, Up to 5 years|Explore the quality of life for subjects by EORTC QLQ-C30, All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.

Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Up to 5 years|Explore the quality of life for subjects by EORTC QLQ-LC13, All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for the scales and single items represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to 5 years|PD-L1, ctDNA, To explore the correlation between clinical efficacy and tumor tissue sample biomarkers (such as PD-L1 level, etc.) and blood sample biomarkers (such as ctDNA level, etc.), Up to 5 years
A total of approximately 390 participants are planned to be enrolled in this study. After being screened and qualified, the subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Envalfolimab or placebo plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in 1:1 ratio for a total of 3-4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (determined by the investigator), the feasibility of surgery is evaluated by the investigator within 4-6 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery will be performed. Envafolimab (experimental group) or placebo (control group) will be administered after surgery. After completion of treatment, subjects will enter a follow-up phase, including safety follow-up, tumor disease follow-up, and survival follow-up.All randomized subjects in this study are required to receive tumor imaging evaluation as scheduled and get continuous safety assessment during the srceening and treatment period.
