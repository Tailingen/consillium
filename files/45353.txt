Investigating Atezolizumab in Newly Diagnosed ER Positive Breast Cancer Patients According to Their AdipOsity
One out of 8 women will develop breast cancer (BC) in her lifetime and despite improvements in therapeutic strategies it remains one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality for women in industrialized countries. Over the past decades another worldwide health problem has emerged: obesity. Around 50% of European women are either overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI)≥25 kg/m2: overweight; BMI≥30 kg/m2: obese). The global health effects of high BMI include the well-known elevated risk for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes and a broad range of cancers, including in the breast.

The connection between BC and obesity is gaining attention because of its clinical relevance. Heavier BC patients are generally older and tend to present with more aggressive disease (larger tumours and more frequent axillary lymph node dissemination). Likewise, they are also at higher risk of recurrence and resistance to therapy. This is of high importance, as development of therapy-resistant metastases is the ultimate cause of death in relapsing patients. Several molecular pathways linking the more aggressive BC nature to obesity have been proposed, such as oestrogens and fat cell signalling molecules, insulin signalling, metabolic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism.

Adiposity is hardly taken into consideration in the treatment of BC patients. This is in contrast with the emerging trend to develop personalized therapies based on individual characteristics of the patient and molecular features of the tumour. Very recent data show that the upcoming treatment strategy of immunotherapy (IT) has better outcomes in obese patients in melanoma, renal cell and lung carcinoma. This could be explained by the fact that obesity induces T-cell dysregulation, which makes these patients more sensitive to IT. Whether or not this accounts for BC as well, is currently unknown. In endocrine BC treatment, research on the effect of BMI on treatment resistance is mainly retrospective and it is unclear whether heavier patients would present a differential benefit to aromatase inhibitors compared to lean patients. Also, most of these studies only considered BMI and no additional adiposity-related inflammation and other variables.

Here, we therefore want to prospectively evaluate the local and systemic effects of aromatase inhibition and immunotherapy, either combined or alone, in a window of opportunity study carried out in luminal B like postmenopausal BC patients.

DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Ki67 decrease, To detect a decrease in Ki67 expression levels at the time of surgery for obese and overweight postmenopausal luminal B like treatment-naïve early BC patients preoperatively having received a single dose of atezolizumab in combination with letrozole daily (arm B) versus letrozole daily alone (arm A)., At surgery|sTIL increase, To detect a stronger increase in stromal Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes (sTIL) at the time of surgery compared to the time of pre-treatment biopsy for obese and overweight postmenopausal luminal B like treatment-naïve early BC patients preoperatively having received a single dose of atezolizumab, either alone (arm C) or in combination with letrozole daily (arm B) versus letrozole daily alone (arm A)., At surgery
