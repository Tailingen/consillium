A Comparative Study Between Early Onset Colorectal Cancer and Late Onset Colorectal Cancer Patients
This study aims to investigate the clinical, socioeconomic, behavioral, genetic, and molecular factors characterizing Early Onset Colorectal Cancer (EOCRC) patients compared with Late Onset Colorectal Cancer (LOCRC) patients
Colorectal Cancer

Early Onset Colorectal Cancer (EOCRC), defined as a Colorectal Cancer (CRC) arising before the age of 50, is increasing and displays more aggressive features compared with Late Onset Colorectal Cancer (LOCRC, with a diagnosis after the age of 50). EOCRC patients have indeed a higher incidence rate of CRC recurrence after surgery compared with LOCRC, even at early CRC stages (stage I or II). The reasons underlying the more aggressive patterns are almost unknown but may span and can be represented by a combination of socioeconomic factors (including low economic income and access to screening programs, diagnosis, or therapy), behavioral and lifestyle factors (including diet, sedentary behaviors, or increased stress and anxiety), and molecular or genetic factors.

The aim of this study is to prospectively validate our previous retrospective findings, demonstrating a higher incidence rate of CRC recurrence in early stage EOCRC, and explore the possible association between lifestyle, dietary, socioeconomics, molecular and genetic factors and postoperative CRC survival.
