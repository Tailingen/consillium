Magnetic Resonance Thermal Image Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy in treating patients with breast cancer. Magnetic resonance thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating up the tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue
Ductal Breast Carcinoma in Situ|Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma|Stage IA Breast Cancer|Stage IB Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance thermal imaging|PROCEDURE: laser interstitial thermal therapy
Frequency of not completing the procedure due to patient's discomfort, Up to 7 days|Observed thermal damage on skin, Moderate degree of skin burn which requires medical intervention will be considered side effects for stopping purposes., Up to 7 days|Grade 3 or 4 toxicities assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), Up to 7 days
Amount of tumor necrosis, Up to 7 days|Amount of viable tumor, Up to 7 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the procedural success rate of using the Visualase magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser system to target, access, thermally monitor, and focally ablate MR-visible breast cancer lesions.

2. To obtain preliminary data on ablative success using pathologic assessment for specimen excised subsequent to the ablation.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo MR-thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) over 1 hour.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-7 days.
