Allogeneic HSCT With Low-Dose Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for GVHD Prevention
This Phase 2, single-arm, open-label study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose (25 mg/kg) post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for prophylaxis of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation following reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning. The study will focus on matched sibling, matched unrelated, and haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell donors. The primary endpoint is 1-year GVHD-Free Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS). The study seeks to determine if low-dose PTCy offers similar outcomes as higher doses, with potentially reduced toxicity.

This study investigates the use of low-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GVHD prophylaxis in a Phase 2, single-arm design. It involves patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells from matched sibling, matched unrelated, and haploidentical donors, following reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning. The aim is to evaluate 1-year GVHD-Free Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS) using 25 mg/kg of PTCy administered on days +3 and +4, in combination with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

The study builds on previous research that has shown the effectiveness of PTCy in preventing GVHD in various transplant settings, including haploidentical and matched unrelated donors. Lower doses of PTCy, such as 25 mg/kg, have been shown to be effective in other settings with reduced toxicity compared to the standard 50 mg/kg dose, and this study will assess whether the same holds true for peripheral blood stem cell transplants.

The findings from this trial will help determine the optimal dosing strategy for PTCy in GVHD prophylaxis, with the potential to improve patient outcomes by minimizing toxicity while maintaining efficacy.
