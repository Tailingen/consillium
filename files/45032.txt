A Feasibility Safety Study of Benign Centrally-Located Intracranial Tumors in Pediatric and Young Adult Subjects
The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop data to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ExAblate 4000 treatment of benign intracranial tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.

Indication of Use: Ablation of benign intracranial tumors in children and young adults which are ExAblate accessible.
Benign Centrally-Located Intracranial Tumors
DEVICE: ExAblate 4000 System
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Safety and Tolerability, Safety will be assessed by tabulation of treatment related adverse events. All adverse events at least possibly procedure related will also be examined in detail for patterns of occurrence., Post ExAblate Procedure through 12 Month Follow-up|Measurement of Tumor Volume, ExAblate procedure will demonstrate feasibility along with measurement of tumor volumes at follow-up as compared to the baseline MRI., Baseline through 12 Month Follow Up
Changes in the General Physical Exam, Any changes in physical examination performed by a physician., Baseline through 12 Month Follow Up|Changes in the Neurological Exam, Any changes in neurological examination performed by the neurologist/neurosurgeon., Baseline through 12 Month Follow Up|Confrontational Visual Field Testing, Changes in confrontational visual field testing performed by a physician, Baseline through 3 Month Follow Up|Global Impression of Change-Clinician, Impression of change as the result of the treatment by a physician, Day 1 through 12 Month Follow Up|Patient Global Impression of Change, Impression of change as the result of the treatment by the subject, Day 1 through 12 Month Follow Up
Change in Seizure Frequency, The change in seizure frequency will be evaluated from baseline through 12 months after treatment., From baseline through 12 months after treatment|QOLCE-55, The change in scores on the QOLCE-55 questionnaire will be evaluated., From baseline through 12 months after treatment
The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop data to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ExAblate 4000 treatment of benign intracranial tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.

Indication of Use: Ablation of benign intracranial tumors in children and young adults which are ExAblate accessible.

This is a feasibility study intended to collect data for use in the development of future studies. As such, no formal statistical hypothesis or hypothesis testing is proposed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of managing benign brain tumor size using ExAblate 4000 treatment of progressing benign intracranial tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.
