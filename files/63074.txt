Isolated Vascularized Gastric Tube Biliary Enteric Drainage: A Paediatric Case Series Experience.
This was a retrospective case series experience of paediatric patients who had an Isolated vascularized gastric tube biliary enteric drainage procedure for biliary obstruction over the past five years. We reviewed our experience and outcomes.
Biliary Obstruction|Choledochal Cyst
PROCEDURE: Isolated Vascularized Gastric Tube (IVGT) graft
Bile drainage, Effectiveness of procedure to allow drainage of bile into the bowel., 30 days
Complications of procedure, What complications were encountered following the procedure, 30 days
Complications, What were the long term complications, 1 year
Background

Despite the enormous surgical advancements in the last century, access to the biliary system is lost when a Roux-en-Y (RY) biliary drainage procedure is performed. Attempts have been made to overcome this inconvenient sequel of RY biliary drainage by the use of variations in the RY anastomosis, small bowel grafts and vascular grafts. These have been predominantly unsuccessful. The use of an Isolated Vascularized Gastric Tube (IVGT) graft has been reported in the literature, and this was successfully used for adult patients with common bile duct injuries. The investigators have adopted the technique of using an IVGT graft for bile duct reconstruction in the paediatric patients at their institution.

Method

The investigators reviewed theirr experience at Greys Hospital, Pietermaritzburg. This was a retrospective review of all paediatric patients who had undergone an IVGT graft procedure for biliary tract anatomical obstruction in the past five years. The investgators looked at the indications for surgery, the demographic profile of the patients, outcomes following surgery and outlined the surgical technique used.
