Tislelizumab Combined With Pemetrexed/ Carboplatin in Patients With Brain Metastases of Non-squamous NSCLC
This is a phase II, Open-Label, Multicenter, Prospective Clinical Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab Combined with Pemetrexed/ Carboplatin in Patients with Brain Metastases of Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. The primary end point is PFS, and secondary endpoint is ORR, OS, DoR and Neurocognitive impairment. during the study, the exploratory objectives including (1) PD-L1 expression, TMB, and other potential predictive biomarkers, correlated with response to treatment (2) Progression-free survival based on intracranial response (iPFS) according to RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM
NSCLC Stage IV|Brain Metastases|PD-1 Antibody
DRUG: Tislelizumab, Carboplatin, Pemetrexed
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate at 12 months according to RECIST v1.1, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the starting date of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, 12months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion (%) of patients with at least one visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the starting date of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the starting date of study drug to the date of death due to any cause, 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RANO-BM, PFS2 is defined as the time from first intracranial disease progression to second/subsequent disease progression (intracranial or extracranial) after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, 36 months|Duration of Response (DoR) according to RECIST v1.1, DoR is defined as the time from the date for first documented response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the date of first documented of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, 36 months|Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), TEAEs graded according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, 36 months|Neurocognitive impairment, Neurocognitive impairment according to Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised（HVLT-R）, 36 months
