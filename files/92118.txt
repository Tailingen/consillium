Glivec® (Imatinib Mesylate, STI571) in Monotherapy Versus Glivec®-Interferon Alpha in the Treatment of Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
To compare the complete cytogenetic response rate in patients with newly-diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with Glivec® alone or in combination with interferon at low doses
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
DRUG: Glivec|DRUG: Interferon
The fundamental objective of this study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of Glivec® given in monotherapy (providing for dose scaling according to the response obtained at different periods of time from the beginning) in combination with standard in|The median survival of patients with CML is close to 7 years.|One year and a half after diagnosis, the rate of progression to the acceleration phase and blastic crisis is very low (3.3%) in patients treated with Glivec® as first line.|With the treatments available hitherto, the achievement of a major cytogenetic response and above all cytogenetic response translates into a prolongation of survival.|Therefore, taking into account that the rate of complete cytogenetic responses to Glivec® in newly-diagnosed CML is 76% after 18 months of treatment (see table I), the fundamental objective of the study will be to compare the rate of complete cytogenetic
