PankoMab-GEX™: Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study
Prospective, open label, dose escalating, multicenter, phase I study measuring the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PankoMab-GEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers refractory to standard treatment. The effect of PankoMab-GEX™ on the development of antibodies and tumor response was also evaluated.

The scale comprises six grades:

0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction

1. Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
2. Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours
3. Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
4. Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair
5. Dead, Until 28±2 days following the last infusion
