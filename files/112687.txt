CEST in Low-grade Glioma Study
Low grade gliomas (LGGs) are malignant, infiltrative and incurable brain tumours that typically present in the younger population. This project proposes to use non-contrast metabolic "Saturation Transfer" (ST)-MRI to evaluate LGG tumour progression and aims to predict early changes in LGG. Early identification of LGG patients whose tumours will progress will permit early interventions. ST-MRI does not involve any intravenous injection of contrast and which acquires metabolic information not seen by standard MRI.
Low-grade Glioma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Saturation Transfer (ST)-MRI
The time-to-progression as measured by Saturation Transfer (ST)-MRI (based on a change in volume or parameter value of over 10%) relative to the time-to-progression as measured by standard MRI using RANO-LGG., Time-to-progression refers to clinical progression of a low-grade glioma to a higher tumour grade., Up to 6 years, from date of initial (ST)-MRI scan until the date of progression
Accuracy of Saturation Transfer (ST)-MRI for detecting progression (based on a change in volume or parameter value of over 10%)., The accuracy will be measured based on Saturation Transfer (ST)-MRI alone without standard MRI., Up to 6 years, from date of initial (ST)-MRI scan until the date of progression
