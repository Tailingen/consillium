The Minimalist Trial-2
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer. Oropharynx SCC (OPSCC) is a common sub-type of HNSCC. Each year, 16,000 new cases of OPSCC are diagnosed in the USA. Most cases of OPSCC (\>90%) are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and are often cured with current therapy.

However, patients treated with surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (POA(C)RT) still experience substantial morbidity. In this highly curable disease, current clinical research interest is focused on investigation of de-escalated therapy, with the goal to reduce treatment-related adverse events (AEs) while maintaining a low recurrence rate.

In this study, patients with HPV-related OPSCC will undergo resection of the primary tumor site and involved/at-risk regional neck nodes. Based on the pathology report, patients will be assigned to:

* Arm 1 (de-POACRT-42 Gy)
* Arm 2A (de-POART-42 Gy)
* Arm 2B (de-POART-37.8 Gy)
* Arm 2C (de-POACRT-30 Gy).

All patients with high-risk pathology will be assigned to Arm 1 whereas patients with intermediate-risk pathology will be randomized (1:1:1) to Arm 2A, Arm 2B, or Arm 2C. Patients with highest-risk pathology and low-risk pathology will be removed from the trial after surgery and will be advised to pursue standard of care options.
HPV-Related Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Recurrence rate, At 2 years
Percent weight loss, For assessing percent weight loss, weight (kg) will be collected weekly during radiation within each arm, starting at Day 1 of RT and ending on the last day of RT. The percent weight loss from the baseline is calculated at any post-baseline., From start of radiation therapy to completion of radiation therapy (estimated to be 6 weeks)|Proportion of patients undergoing PEG tube placement, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 10 weeks)|Duration of need for an indwelling PEG tube, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 10 weeks)|Proportion of patients taking narcotic, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 10 weeks)|Number of participants with adverse events, From start of surgery through 24-month follow-up visit (estimated to be 2 years and 10 weeks)|Mean change in serum creatinine during radiation therapy, Serum creatinine levels are collected at Day 1 of RT and ending on the last day of RT., From start of radiation therapy to completion of radiation therapy (estimated to be 6 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated from the date of surgery to the date of progression, death of any cause, or last known date alive., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 10 weeks)|Overall survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death or last known date alive., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 10 weeks)
