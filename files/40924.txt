Associations Between Pre-transplant Comorbidities and Post-transplant Toxicities and Quality of Life
We are interested in studying whether and how medical problems other than primary cancer before hematopoietic cell transplantation would impact the profiles of quality of life and toxicities post-transplantation for patients with blood cancers. We want to see if by assessing comorbidities (such as diabetes) early on, we can identify those patients who will have more toxicities or limitations in their quality of life after transplant. The generated information could set the stage for future intervention studies aiming to improve quality of life for patients with blood cancers after transplantation.

The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, A 19-item instrument, it assesses physical symptoms and their interference with life., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant Scale, A 49-item questionnaire measuring quality of life in bone marrow transplant patients, it measures physical, functional, social/family and emotional well-being in addition to bone marrow transplant-specific concerns., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|The EQ-5D, This measure is used to measure utilities that can be used to calculate a quality adjusted survival score., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|The Social Activity Log, This measure captures the frequency and diversity of social activities outside of daily responsibilities., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|ENRICHD Social Support Instrument, This measures social support, including participation in social activities and perception of social support., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|The Cancer and Treatment Distress Scale, This is a 25-item scale assessing distress related to perceived demands from events specific to cancer survivors., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months|The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The PHQ-9 measures measures depression and parallels the nine diagnostic symptom criteria of the DSM-IV for Major Depressive Disorder., Change from Baseline in Symptoms at 3,6,12,and 24 months
National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), We will measure toxicities using the NCI CTCAE, at 90 days
