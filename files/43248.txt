Proglumide With Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in PatientsWith Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
This is a Phase I open labelled study to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with combination therapy using standard of care first line therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel given days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days, and proglumide. This is a phase 1 study with 3+3 design, enrolling3-12 patients over 2 planned dose levels of proglumide(maximum 6 patients per dose level). Proglumide will be tested at the daily dose of 1200 mg orally (PO) given as 400mg three times daily (TID) (dose level 1) or 1600 mg orally(PO) given as 800 mg twice a day (BID) (dose level 2). All cycles are 28 days. Patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity by laboratory blood testing and physical examinations.
