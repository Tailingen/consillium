Radiation Plus Cetuximab in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this trial is to study combined locoregional radiotherapy with cetuximab in non-operable NSCLC Stage III (Phase II trial).

Endpoints:

safety and feasibility (primary) response, survival, time to progression (secondary)
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: cetuximab
safety: rate of side effects (skin reactions, allergic reactions, decrease of pulmonary function), 3 yrs
response (RECIST criteria of primary tumor and enlarged lymphnodes), 3 yrs|survival (at 3 years), 3 yrs|time to progression (locally and systemically), 3 yrs
Study entry examinations:

* blood cell count
* liver enzymes
* ventilatory function test
* pregnancy test (premenopausal women)
* CT of the thorax
* CT of the brain
* Ultrasound of the liver
* Bone scan
* FDG PET scan (after inclusion)

Follow-up examinations (2 months, than every 3 months):

* patients history and examination
* CT scan of the thorax
* ventilatory functions test
* FDG PET scan (at least at 6 months)
* bone scan (yearly)
* ultrasound of the liver (every 6 months)

Cetuximab administration:

* 450 mg / m\^2 body surface on week 1
* 250 mg /m\^2 body surface weekly, week 2 -21

Radiation therapy:

* intensity modulated radiation therapy of primary tumor and mediastinum (2 Gy single dose, total dose 50 Gy; 5 fractions per week) with boost to the PET positive sites (2 Gy single doses up to 66 Gy). Radiation therapy during weeks 2-8.
