Cancer Chronic Pain Predicted by Emotional and Cognitive Status
The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive dimension of cognitive-emotional status of cancer patients on the chronic pain development 6 months after different cancer treatment protocol (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy ...).

- The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life of cancer patients. It is divided in 9 subscales consisting of several items: 5 subscales measuring functional status (physical, role, social, emotional, cognitive), three subscales measuring symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting) and a global subscale of quality of life and health. Finally, six items/isolated symptoms, covering cancer symptoms and frequent side effects of cancer therapies (e.g. loss of appetite) are also included in the EORTC QLQ-C30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 Score ranges from 0 to 126, at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months,|Social vulnerability assessment by EPICES questionnaire, at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Anxiety and Depression assessment by HAD scale, at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Illness perception assessment, Global score ranges from 0 to 200, at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Coping strategies assessment by Coping strategies questionnaire (CSQ), 2 days after each cancer treatment protocol.
This is an observational, longitudinal and multicenter study assessing in cancer patients the link between the cognitive-emotional status and the development of chronic pain.

Cognition, anxiety, depression, quality of life, social vulnerability, cancer perception, pain and analgesic consumption are assessed.
