Evaluation of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Dinutuximab Beta As Maintenance Therapy in Chinese Participants With High-Risk Neuroblastoma
This was an open-label, multi-center, single-arm, Phase 1 study. The purpose of this study was for evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab beta as maintenance therapy in Chinese participants with high-risk neuroblastoma
