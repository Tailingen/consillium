Cavity Shaving in Breast Conserving Surgery for Breast Cancer Patients
This randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of additional cavity shaving (CS) on pathological cavity margin (CM) status in breast cancer patients. Patients receiving standard breast-conserving surgery (BCS) will be randomized to intra-operative CM assessment versus intra-operative CS followed by CM assessment. The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CS on intra-operative CM status, intra-operative re-excision rate, post-operative CM status and re-excision rate, cosmetic outcomes, and on intraoperative time and medical costs.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cavity shaving|PROCEDURE: Standardized BCS+CM assessment.
Positivity rate of CMs by intraoperative frozen section analysis., Proportion of patients with at least one positive(invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, excluding LCIS) CMs on intraoperative frozen section analysis, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)
Intra-operative rate of suspected/positive CM, Proportion of patients with at least one positive(invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, excluding LCIS) or suspected CMs on intraoperative frozen section analysis. Suspected CMs were defined as CMs with severe atypical hyperplasia observed by frozen section analysis., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Rate of intra-operative re-excision for suspected/positive CMs, For patients with positive CMs, intra-operative re-excision was required. For patients with suspected CMs,intra-operative re-excision is left to the surgeon's discretion, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Rate of a second-time surgery for post-operative positive CMs, Positive CMs by post-operative pathological analysis may require a second-time surgery for re-excision., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Proportion of patients successfully undergone BCT, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Cost-effectiveness of cavity shaving in BCS as measured by operative time of the surgery, Surgery time(start from making the incision to closure) will be analyzed., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Cost-effectiveness of cavity shaving in BCS as measured by medical cost of the surgery, Medical costs will be analyzed., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Cosmetic outcome, Patients', partners' and physicians' perceptions of the cosmetic outcomes as measured by Harvard/NSABP/RTOG criteria, One year after surgery.|Adverse events, One year after surgery.|Quality of life., Chinese version of validated QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaire, One year after surgery.
Volume of cavity shaving tissue., Water displacement method was used to measure the volume of the tissue resected by cavity shaving., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Weight of cavity shaving tissue., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Relationship between the volume of tissue excised in association aesthetic outcomes, Volume of the excised tissue, including the tumor-containing specimen will be analyzed., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)|Risk factors for positive CMs, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 12 months)
After stratified and blocked randomization, the patients' name, admission ID and treatment assignment will be written on a slip of paper, and will be placed in a sealed envelop. A label with the patients' name and admission ID will be placed on the sealed envelop, which will be kept in a locked file. On the day of surgery, a research coordinator will bring the sealed envelope to the operation room. During the standard-of-care BCS, the tumor was excised with a rim of grossly normal tissue. Additional resections are allowed when any of the margins of the tumor-containing specimen were suspected to be inadequate on the basis of standard gross evaluation by surgeons. Prior to intra-operative CM assessment, the research co-ordinator will unseal the envelop and determine which procedure has been designated to the patient. The cosmetic outcome and the quality of life will be evaluated at the day of discharge, after completion of radiotherapy and one year by the patient herself, her partner and a research co-ordinator.
