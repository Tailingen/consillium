The Use of Intensive Care in Critically Ill Cancer Haematological Patients: "TRIAL-OH"
The purpose of this study is to determine:

* Condition of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with haematological malignancies.
* ICU hospital and up to one year mortality.
* Assessment of post ICU burden and health related quality at 90-d and 1 year.
Hematological Malignancies
Survival status at one year, survival status (alive or death) at one year, 1 year
Health related quality of life of patients and their relatives, day 90 and 1 year|ICU mortality, survival status at ICU discharge, 1 week (estimated mean time until ICU discharge)|Survival status, day 90|Hospital mortality, survival status at hospital discharge, 3 weeks (estimated mean time until Hospital discharge)
1. To identify prognostic factors of short and medium term mortality, by underlining the respective weights of organ dysfunction and characteristics of underlined malignancy
2. Evaluate the health related quality of life of intensive care survivors(SF36)
3. Impact of intensive care on families burden (HADS, IES).
4. Assess clinicians' satisfaction ( intensivists, haematologists and intensive care nurses) in relation to medical decision-making.
5. Establish the relevance of antifungal treatments.
