Efficacy and Safety of ALSS Treatment for ICIs-LF in Patients With HCC
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of artificial liver support system treatment for immune checkpoint inhibitors related liver failure in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly used for advanced stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recent years. The incident rate of Grade 4 immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced immune mediated hepatitis reaches 14.5%. Since these patients usually develop into liver failure, it is urgent to find out a more suitable therapy. Artificial liver support system (ALSS) treatment has been proved to effectively control both immune mediated hepatitis and liver failure, it may be a new therapy for immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced liver failure (ICIs-LF) in patients with HCC. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of ALSS treatment, including the classic mode of plasma exchange (PE) and new combination mode of double plasma molecular adsorption system (DPMAS) with sequential low-dose plasma exchange (LPE), for ICIs-LF in patients with HCC. Sixty patients with HCC and ICIs-LF will be enrolled in this study. The participants are randomly divided into trial group (DPMAS+LPE, and comprehensive internal medical treatment) and control group (PE and comprehensive internal medical treatment). Symptoms, signs, laboratory tests results, adverse events, mortality rates are recorded from treatment baseline to 12 weeks.
