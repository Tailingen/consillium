Report of the Survival Outcomes of Patients With Esophageal Cancer After Definitive Radiotherapy in China
In this study, data of esophageal cancer patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy in 14 institutions from various provinces in China were evaluated to help strengthen confidence in anti-cancer, including rehabilitation, economic burden, and quality of life.

RADIATION: definitive radiotherapy or definitive chemoradiotherapy

the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire module to assess quality of life (QOL), The EORTC QLQ-core 30 questionnaire is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures including 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status-QoL scale, and 6 single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than 1 scale. High scale score=higher response level; a high score for a functional scale=a healthy level of function, high score for the global health status/QoL=high quality of life but a high score for a symptom scale / item=high level of symptomatology/problems. The principle for scoring these scales: 1.) Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale = raw score. 2.) Linear transformation to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Results should be interpreted with caution as the numbers of patients with available data over time were limited, and because of high variances as evidenced by large standard deviations., 5 year|Costs of treatment, Financial burden, Whether medical insurance is affordable, 5 year|Proportion of using chemotherapy or target therapy concurrently with radiotherapy, Medication, 2 month
