B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects with a best overall disease response of complete response (CR) or Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). For ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia), complete remission is defined as: less than 5% blasts in marrow, less than 1% blasts in blood and no EM disease., Up to 15 years post-infusion|B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Duration of response (DOR), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documented evidence of response (the first response prior to confirmation) until time of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Relapse-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of the study treatment to the date of the first documented disease recurrence or death due to any cause whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Event-free survival (EFS), Event free survival is the time from the date of start of treatment to the earliest of the following:

* Death from any cause after remission
* Relapse
* Treatment failure (failure to achieve remission, including death without remission), Up to 15 years post-infusion|B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Proportion of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status in bone marrow who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of CR or CRi, MRD is a term used to describe a very small number of cancer cells that remain in the body during or after treatment. MRD is defined as positive by immunophenotype if 1/1000 cells is positive., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma - Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects with a best overall disease response of complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), Up to 15 years post-infusion|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma - DOR, Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documented evidence of response (the first response prior to confirmation) until time of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma - RFS, RFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of the study treatment to the date of the first documented disease recurrence or death due to any cause whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma - Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma - Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of death due to any reason., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma - ORR, The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects with a best overall disease response of complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma -Complete response rate (CRR), Complete response rate is the proportion of patients with a complete disease response, which is defined as the best disease response recorded from date of start of treatment until progressive disease or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma - DOR, Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documented evidence of response (the first response prior to confirmation) until time of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma - RFS, RFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of the study treatment to the date of the first documented disease recurrence or death due to any cause whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma - PFS, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause whichever comes first., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Follicular Lymphoma - Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of death due to any reason., Up to 15 years post-infusion|Frequency and rate of pregnancy outcomes, pregnancy outcomes:

* Live birth, at term (presence or absence of congenital abnormality)
* Live birth, premature (presence or absence of congenital abnormality)
* Intrauterine fetal death
* Spontaneous abortion
* Elective abortion
* Unknown, Up to 15 years post-infusion
This study will inform on long-term real-world safety and effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel. The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and the risk of secondary malignancies in patients with B lymphocyte malignancies treated with tisagenlecleucel in a real-world setting. The main secondary objective is to evaluate the longterm effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel.

All participants enrolled in this study will be followed up for 15 years from the time of KymriahÂ® infusion.
