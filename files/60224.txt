Study Details:

Definitive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is often used to treat medically inoperable patients with cancers in many different organs, including the kidneys. However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is conventionally considered "radioresistant" to fully fractionated EBRT. In an effort to overcome the perceived "radioresistance" of RCC, severely hypofractionated EBRT in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy has renewed interest in the management of renal cell carcinoma with radiotherapy. This study will be evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for the treatment of cancers of the kidney.

Participants in this study will be allocated to receive either multi-fraction SABR (3 fractions over 2 weeks) or single fraction SABR (1 fraction only).

All participants will be assessed at regular intervals post treatment in order to estimate the activity and efficacy of the technique, evaluate tolerability, estimate survival, estimate distant failure rate, and renal function change after SABR.

The follow-up visits occur at 4 weeks and every 3 months in the 1st year post treatment, then every 6 months in the second year and then yearly until study closure (2 years after the last participant finishes study treatment).
