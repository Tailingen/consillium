A Study of AK-01 (LY3295668) in Solid Tumors
This two-part study consists of a phase 1 dose escalation study in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and a phase 2 portion in up to 3 groups with either small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and/or one other solid tumor type.

DRUG: LY3295668
Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was defined as the dose immediately below the dose at which ≥2/3, ≥2/6, or ≥3/9 participants in a cohort experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 21 days of treatment (Cycle 1) in Phase 1., Cycle 1 (21 days)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) [Objective Response Rate (ORR)], Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as a percentage of responders who achieved complete response or partial response (CR+PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1). Complete response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target (and non-target) lesions, and no appearance of new lesion. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of LD, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions., Baseline to Objective Disease Progression (Up to 11 months)
Phase 1: Number of Participants With One or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) is an AE that started or worsened (increased in severity) from the treatment start date to 30 days after the treatment end date. A summary of other non-serious Adverse Events (AEs), and all Serious Adverse Events (SAE's), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Cycle 1 Day 1 through 30 Days After Treatment End Date (Up to 29 Months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants With One or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) is an AE that started or worsened (increased in severity) from the treatment start date to 30 days after the treatment end date.
