Randomized Control Trial (RCT) of Early Palliative Care for HCC
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of early palliative care consultation on quality of life, use of hospital resources, end-of-life care and survival among Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients with advanced End Stage Live Disease not eligible for potentially curative or local area therapy. Half of patients will receive early palliative care at diagnosis of HCC and other half will receive palliative care when all standard therapy treatments have been exhausted.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
BEHAVIORAL: Early Palliative Care/Symptom Control
Change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), The primary outcome is the change in the patient's primary need based upon HRQoL survey. These scores range from 0-100 for the role functioning scale, physical function scale and the other QLQ-C30 scales and HCC18 symptom complexes., 6 months
Survival, Overall Survival. The investigators will assess if the intervention improves overall survival. The unit of measure will be months, 2 Years after diagnosis|Resource Utilization, The investigators will determine if the intervention decreases resource utilization (ICU days and length of stay). The unit of measure will be days., 2 Years after diagnosis|Cost Utilization, The investigators will determine if the intervention decreases cost between groups. To do this, the investigators will track cost per group from time of study enrollment to either death, withdrawal or study completion. Cost will be estimated in US dollars., 2 Years after diagnosis
Intro:

Hypothesis Methods Analysis Anticipated Results

Palliative care will focus on providing relief from the symptoms and stress associated from cancer. This helps improve quality of life for cancer patients and their family. This care is usually offered to patients when all standard therapy treatments have been exhausted.
