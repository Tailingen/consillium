Effect of Yoga in Reducing Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting
* This randomized controlled three arm study compares the effects of a yoga intervention with jacobsons progressive muscle relaxation training and only standard of care in chemotherapy naive cancer patients.
* This study will also assess the neurophysiological correlates of nausea and vomiting and assess if effects of intervention on nausea and vomiting outcomes are mediated by changes in gastric motility (electrogastrogram) or stress arousal (cardiac autonomic function and sympathetic skin response) or self reported anxiety.

Effect of yoga on chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, This study is to evaluate the effects of yoga intervention vs. Jacobsons progressive muscle relaxation vs. standard of care only on chemotherapy induced nausea and emesis (CINV) outcomes, 4 months (prior to every cycle of chemotherapy,for 4 cycles)
Quality of life after chemotherapy, Here we evaluate the effects of yoga intervention on secondary outcomes such as quality of life and anxiety states, 4 months
