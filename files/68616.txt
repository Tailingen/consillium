Pembrolizumab in Combination With Paclitaxel in the Hormone Receptor-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer With High Tumor Mutational Burden Selected by Whole Exome Sequencing: Korean Cancer Study Group Trial (KCSG BR20-16)
Abbreviated Title : Pembrolizumab in hypermutated breast cancer Trial Phase : II Clinical Indication : Hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer Trial Type : Interventional Type of control : None Route of administration : Intravenous Trial Blinding : None Treatment Groups : Pembrolizumab Number of trial subjects : Approximately 150 patients will be prescreened with whole exome sequencing. Then 30 patients will be enrolled in the treatment phase.

Estimated enrollment period : 12 months Estimated duration of trial : The sponsor estimates that the trial will require approximately 24 months from the time the first subject signs the informed consent until the last subject's last visit.

Duration of Participation : 12 months Estimated average length of treatment per patient : 8 months

DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Change of objective response rate(ORR) by RECIST 1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1 in hormone receptor-positive, hypermutated metastatic breast cancer identified by whole exome sequencing (WES) Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab in patients with hormone receptor-positive, hypermutated metastatic breast cancer identified by WES will result in clinically meaningful ORR based on RECIST 1.1, Every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
Clinical benefit rate(CBR) by RECIST 1.1, through study completion, an average of 1 year
