Study of Apatinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with advanced HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib
Objective Response Rate(ORR), one year
Disease Control Rate (DCR), one year|Progression free survival (PFS), one year|Overall survival (OS), one year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0[Quality of life], one year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety], one year
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. It is lack of effective drugs for systemic treatment of HCC. Currently, Sorafenib is the only choice approved by FDA for advanced HCC, although it prolongs the survival for less than 3 months. The treatment of advanced HCC still has a long way to go.

At present, the relevant phase II and phase III clinical studies of apatinib on advanced HCC are ongoing. Based on our important discovery of our previous clinical studies, we intends to enlarge the sample size and make further observation for the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with advanced HCC.
