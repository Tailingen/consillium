Efficacy and Safety of PD-0332991 in Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Refractory to Imatinib and Sunitinib
The treatment of advanced GIST patients is based on imatinib followed with sunitinib in case of resistance/intolerance. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) on sunitinib is frequently short, and after failure with both imatinib and sunitinib, treatment remains controversial.

Previous studies on GISTs have linked 9p21 alterations to tumor progression (El-Rifai et al. 2000; Kim et al., 2000; Schneider-Stock et al., 2003; Schneider-Stock et al., 2005; Romeo et al. 2009; Haller et al., 2008) but the driver gene was not positively identified (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, or MTAP) (Astolfi et al., 2010; Belinsky et al., 2009; Perrone et al., 2005; Assamaki et al. 2007; Huang et al., 2009). A recent study has shown that homozygous 9p21 deletions target CDKN2A and more specifically p16INK4a 4. Most of the CINSARC genes are known to be under the transcriptional control of E2F. RB1 sequesters E2F, which is released from the complex upon RB1 phosphorylation by CDK4. CDK4 is, in turn, inhibited by p16INK4a. Hence, we hypothesize that alteration of the restriction point via deletion of p16INK4a (and more rarely of RB1: 20% of cases) gene in GISTs is likely to be a causative event that leads to the overexpression of CINSARC genes, which in turn induce chromosome instability and ultimately metastasis. Low p16INK4a expression was associated with response to PD-0332991 in several in vitro tumor model(Konecny et al. 2011; Katsumi et al. 2011; Finn et al. 2009). Considering our molecular data, we believed that PD-0332991 warrants clinical investigation in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors with alteration of p16INK4a. This alteration is detectable by comparative genomic hybridization which is a technique highly manageable in the context of routine clinical care and clinical trial.

Main objective was to assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of non-progression at 16 weeks (after centralized review) in patients with documented disease progression while on therapy with imatinib and sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST.
Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: PD 0332991
Number of Participants With Non Progression at 4 Months, Efficacy is assessed based on 4-month non progression. Non progression is defined as complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Non-progression rate will be calculated as the number of alive and progression free patients divided by the number of eligible and assessable patients for the efficacy analysis. Eligible and assessable populations are described in corresponding section of protocol. As recommended by RECIST v1.1, all claimed response will be centrally reviewed by an expert of the study. The results of the centralized radiological review will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint., 16 weeks after first administration of treatment
Number of Participants With Objective Response at 4 Months, Objective response is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 Efficacy is assessed based on objective response at 4-month. Objective response is defined as complete or partial response (CR, PR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Objective reponse will be calculated as the number of alive patients with objective reponse divided by the number of eligible and assessable patients for the efficacy analysis. Eligible and assessable populations are described in corresponding section of protocol. As recommended by RECIST v1.1, all claimed response will be centrally reviewed by an expert of the study. The results of the centralized radiological review will be used for the analysis., 16 weeks after first administration of treatment|Efficacy Assessment of PD-0332991 in Terms of Progression-free Survival Time, Progression-free survival time is defined as the time from the first administration of treatment to progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death of any cause, whichever occurs first.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 18 months following first administration of treatment|Efficacy Assessment of PD-0332991 in Terms of Overall Survival Time, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first administration of treatment to death., up to 24 months following first administration of treatment
Medical Conditions : Adult patients with Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Refractory to Imatinib and Sunitinib

Study design : Exploratory, one-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial based on two-stage Simon's design

Main objective : To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of non-progression at 16 weeks (after centralized review) in patients with documented disease progression while on therapy with imatinib and sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST.

Secondary objectives

* To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of :

  * Objective response rate (ORR) (as per RECIST v1.1 criteria)
  * Progression-free survival (PFS) (as per RECIST v1.1 criteria)
  * Overall survival
* To assess the safety of PD-0332991

Study drug formulation: PD-0332991 is formulated as gelatin capsules of 100 mg and 25 mg respectively. PD-0332991 was administrated orally. PD-0332991 dosed on a flat scale of 125 mg. PD-0332991 was administrated on a 21 days on / 7 days off dosing schedule. One cycle was considered to consist of 4 weeks of PD-0332991 administration.Patients were treated with PD-0332991 until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation for any other reason.

Tumor assessment and response assessed according to RECIST v1.1, with same type of exam in regard of baseline.

All potential sites of tumor lesions (target and non-target lesions) assessed using MRI or CT Scan with IV contrast of the Thorax Abdomen and Pelvis using a 5mm slice thickness with a contiguous reconstruction algorithm (a PET scan is not acceptable for radiological evaluation).

Evaluation were assessed:

* at baseline within 21 days before the first dose of PD-0332991
* at D(28) of Cycle 1, at D(28) of Cycle 2 then every 8 weeks until month six and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or starting other treatment.

Response regarding the first endpoint was assessed by central radiology review. Whenever the criteria of response are met (Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)), the appropriate imaging tests were repeated at least four weeks later in order to confirm the response.

The decision regarding patient management remained with the local investigator.

optionnal: Fresh tumor biopsies FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) at screening and at Day 21 of Cycle 1 are encouraged to be collected. Once collected, the samples may be profiled by IHC, and array gene expression analysis
