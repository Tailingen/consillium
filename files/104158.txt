Single-cell RNA Sequencing Resolves the Regulatory Role of HBV on the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Immune Microenvironment
In summary, with the help of single-cell sequencing technology, this study aims to focus on elucidating the influence of HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cell metabolic changes on microenvironment remodeling. With the help of hepatocellular carcinoma microenvironment changes, this study provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment method for HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.
