Lapatinib In Combination With Trastuzumab Versus Lapatinib Monotherapy In Subjects With HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab versus lapatinib monotherapy in subjects with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: Lapatinib|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause., Baseline to disease progression or death due to any cause or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, OS was censored at the time of last contact., Baseline to death or 30 days after last dose for the last participant (up to 216 weeks)|Overall Tumor Response (OR), OR was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing either a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0. CR was defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD, with non-target lesions not increased or absent., Baseline to disease progression or death or discontinuation from study or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)|Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), CBR: percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks according to RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum LD, with non-target lesions not increased or absent. SD: neither had sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) in target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment started; persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions., Baseline to disease progression or death or discontinuation from study or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was defined as the time from randomization until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first). TTR could not be analyzed because too few participants experienced a confirmed CR or PR., Baseline until first documented evidence of CR or PR or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)|Duration of Response (DR), DR was defined for the subset of participants who showed a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death. Because of the low number of participants experiencing a confirmed response in both treatment arms, analysis for this outcome measure was not performed., Time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer. Because this outcome measure was confounded by death due to other causes and was similar to PFS, it was not analyzed., Baseline to disease progression or death or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Scores at Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and Conclusion or Withdrawal From Study, Quality of Life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, which was a 37-item (27 general and 10 breast cancer-specific questions) self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 dimensions: physical-, social/family-, emotional-, functional-well being, and a breast cancer subscale. Higher scores on the FACT-B scales indicate a higher QOL; each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The score is transformed for FACT-B and results in a total score ranging from 0 to 144., Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and conclusion or withdrawal from study (up to Week 108)
