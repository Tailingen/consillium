Photodynamic Treatment of Actinic Keratoses With Different Light Doses
Aim of the study: To evaluate clinical effectiveness of two different light doses when treating actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid.
Actinic Keratosis
DEVICE: Photodynamic therapy with light dose of 70 J/cm2 using a broad-band red light source|PROCEDURE: Photodynamic therapy with 100J/cm2 light dose using a broad-band red light source
Clinically cleared actinic keratosis with histological evaluation when clinically suspicious for relapse, All treated actinic keratoses evaluated by two investigators for clinical/histological relapse at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 after treatment, 3 months
Pain during the treatment, Patients inform a present investigator about pain severity at the beginning, in the middle, at the end of the session and move a counter of visual analogue scale., 2 years
To determine and compare clinical and histological effectiveness of different (70 J/cm2 ir 100 J/cm2) light doses when treating actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy.

To determine pain intensity during photodynamic therapy with visual analogue scale and factors influencing pain during the procedure.
