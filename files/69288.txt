Fruquintinib Plus Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine as Maintenance Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After First-line Chemotherapy
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib plus capecitabine versus capecitabine as maintenance therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer after first-line treatment. Patients who have already achieved disease control (including CR/PR and SD) after ≥6 cycles of standard first-line induction treatment, and are still unresectable would be assigned into 2 maintenance treatment groups by randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive fruquintinib + capecitabine or capecitabine. All patients will be treated until progressive disease, death from any cause, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.
