Osimertinib Combined With Bevacizumab in Patients With Brain Metastasis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
There is no positive data on osimertinib in the treatment of metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study is to study osimertinib combined with bevacizumab in the management of patients with brain metastasis harboring EGFR mutation.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: osimertinib oral and bevazizumab intravenously
PFS, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), 30 months
OS, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of participant's death due to any cause., Up to 48 months|ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 48 months
Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is the most common cause of death from cancer (almost 20 percent \[%\] of cancer deaths); NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancers. The hypothesis is that osimertinib combined bevacizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC patients with brain metastasis characterized by EGFR mutations . Efficacy assessments will include disease assessment, symptomatic progression and patient-reported outcome. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).
