Window of Opportunity Trial of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) or Durvalumab/Tremelimumab as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy to Identify Immune Dynamics in Surgically Resectable Head and Neck Cancer Patients.
This is a phase II randomized, open label study of durvalumab with/ without tremelimumab as neoadjuvant therapy and durvalumab maintenance after SoC RTx with/without cisplatin as post-surgical adjuvant therapy in treatment naïve participants with newly diagnosed resectable LA HNSCC. The study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Approximately 44 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to below two Arms
