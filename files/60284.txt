Calcitriol, Mitoxantrone, and Prednisone in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Calcitriol may cause prostate cancer cells to look more like normal cells, and to grow and spread more slowly. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving calcitriol together with mitoxantrone and prednisone works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, defined as the fraction of patients with 50% reduction in PSA level over 3 weeks' time, in patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer treated with high-dose pulse calcitriol, mitoxantrone, and prednisone.

Secondary

* Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral high dose pulse calcitriol on day 1, mitoxantrone IV on day 2, and oral prednisone on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
