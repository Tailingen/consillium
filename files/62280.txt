Vaccination of High Risk Breast Cancer Patients
Objective - Determine the safety and tolerability of a peptide mimotope-based vaccine upon immunization of breast cancer subjects.
Stage IV Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Vaccination with Mimotope P10s-PADRE/MONTANIDE ISA 51 VG
Number of Participants With a Dose-limiting Toxicity (Defined as an Adverse Event of Grade 3 or Higher), The safety and tolerability of the P10s-PADRE/MONTANIDE ISA51 VG vaccine will be determined by toxicity assessments throughout the duration of the study. Subjects will be evaluated for toxicity using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0., 9 weeks per subject
After signing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent, cohorts of 3-6 stage IV breast cancer subjects will be enrolled into the study. The vaccine doses will be prepared and dispensed by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Pharmacy following the manufacturer's instructions. Subjects will receive 1.0 mL subcutaneous (SC) injections of the vaccine on 5 separate occasions during Weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 19. The first cohort will begin with the 300 mg dose, and then the subsequent cohorts will escalate to 500 mg or de-escalate to 100 mg as determined by the toxicity criteria. The immunization at week 19 is considered a booster immunization. The vaccine will be administered at rotating sites on the limbs or abdomen. The study will last for approximately 12 - 24 months.
