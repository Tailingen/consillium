Evaluation of a Three Dimensional Functional Metabolic Imaging and Risk Assessment System in Classifying Women for Likelihood of Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of MIRA in classifying women with dense breast tissue for supplemental breast MRI. To assess the effectiveness of MIRA for correctly classifying women with breast cancer and to evaluate the safety of the device.

In women above 30 years old who are undergoing MRI or are scheduled for image-guided needle biopsy due to lesions detected by other imaging modalities.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: MIRA device imaging
determining MIRA's PPV (positive predictive value), * The positive predictive value (and the amount of false-positive diagnoses) of MIRA will be determined using positive MRI (MRI BI-RADS \>= 3) as a reference test in cohort of women with negative (Mammography BI-RADS 1 or 2).
* The positive predictive value (and the amount of false-positive diagnoses) of MIRA will be determined using the histological diagnosis as the reference test in ALL women participated in the study., 24 months
