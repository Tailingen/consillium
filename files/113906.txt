Neoadjuvant Dose-dense EC Followed by ABX With PD-1 for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety for dose-dense epirubicin hydrochloride with cyclophosphamide followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound paclitaxel with PD-1 in neoadjuvant therapy for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and to explore the predictive value of biological markers for the treatment.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Albumin bound paclitaxel|DRUG: Toripalimab
Total Pathologic complete response (tpCR), Defined as no residual invasive cancer cells are found in the pathological examination of breast and axillary lymph node; if only residual in situ cancer cells are present in the surgical specimens, it can also be considered as achieving a pathological complete response., Immediately after the surgery
Breast pathologic complete response (bpCR: ypT0/is) rate, Defined as the absence of invasive cancer cells in breast., Immediately after the surgery|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response by MRI., Immediately after the surgery|Breast conservative surgery rate, Defined as the percentage of patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, out of the total number of evaluable cases., Immediately after the surgery|Event-free survival (EFS), Defined as the time from the date of the first study dose to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Approximately 3 years|Adverse events (AEs), Refer to any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered an investigational product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AE is assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0., During this period between the start of randomization and the last visit, approximately 3 years|Change in immune-related tissue biomarkers, The proportion of Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is evaluated through HE staining. Immunohistochemical staining of PD-1, PD-L1, AR, CD8, and FOXC1) is performed. TILs, PD1, PD-L1, AR, CD8, and FOXC1 in tumor samples by biopsy at baseline, at the end of Cycle 2 and by surgery immediately after surgery would be evaluated by HE or immune staining., At baseline, at the end of first 2 cycles (each cycle is 14 days) and immediately after the surgery
This study is an open single arm study, which would undergo optimal two stage designs. 60 patients who are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer would have dose-dense epirubicin hydrochloride with cyclophosphamide followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound paclitaxel with PD-1 regimen for neoadjuvant therapy if they meet the eligibility criteria. The regimen is as follows: epirubicin hydrochloride (90mg/m2, d1) plus cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2, d1) every 14 days as one cycle for 4 cycles, followed by nanoparticlealbumin-bound paclitaxel (125mg/m2, d1) per week for 3 weeks as one cycle for 4 cycles, and Toripalimab (240mg, d1) every 3 weeks as one cycle for 4 cycles. pathological complete response would be the primary endpoint. The change of biological markers and safety of the regimen would also be evaluated.
