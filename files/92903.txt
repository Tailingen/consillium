Safety and Efficacy of AGN-INM176 in Prostate Patients With Rising PSA
This Phase I/II open-label trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the herbal supplement INM176 in patients with a history of prostate cancer or low-risk disease under active surveillance. The study will determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess the efficacy of INM176 in stabilizing or decreasing plasma PSA levels in post-radical prostatectomy (RP) and post-radiation therapy (RT) patients with rising PSA levels.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: INM176
Safety of INM176 after 1, 3 and 6 cycles of exposure at RP2D, Safety will be assessed as the combined incidence of adverse events, abnormal safety blood tests, and abnormal ECG readings, expressed as the proportion of participants showing any of these safety concerns following 1, 3, and 6 treatment cycles., 10 months|Efficacy of INM176 by Measuring PSA Level Changes After 6 Cycles of Treatment at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), This outcome will assess the efficacy of INM176 by measuring changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels from baseline to after 6 cycles of treatment at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D). PSA levels will be monitored at baseline and following each treatment cycle, with a primary focus on the change observed after 6 cycles. The degree of PSA reduction will serve as an indicator of INM176's effectiveness in controlling or reducing prostate cancer activity., 10 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be defined as the highest dose at which â‰¤ 1 out of 6 participants experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment. Dose-limiting toxicities will be monitored and assessed based on predefined criteria CTCAE version 5.0. The Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be established based on safety, tolerability, and any observed efficacy at or below the MTD. RP2D will also take into consideration pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and other relevant biomarkers if applicable. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design to identify the MTD and RP2D., 1 month|Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are defined as adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be related to the study treatment and occur during the first treatment cycle (e.g., 28 days). DLTs will be evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The occurrence of DLTs will guide dose escalation decisions and help identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)., 1 month
The study is designed as a Phase I/II open-label trial to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of the herbal supplement INM176 in intercepting prostate cancer-specific PSA levels. The primary objective of the Phase I stage is to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) through a 3+3 dose escalation design while evaluating the safety of INM176 during a 4-week cycle for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with a history of prostate cancer or those under active surveillance for low-risk disease.

In the Phase II stage, the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of INM176 at the RP2D in stabilizing or reducing plasma PSA levels after six cycles of treatment in post-RP and post-RT patients experiencing a rise in PSA.

Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis on the first and last doses of Cycle 1, correlating PK metrics to safety and efficacy outcomes, stratified by CYP2C19 and 3A4 metabolizer status. Additional secondary measures involve assessing PSA changes, immunophenotyping of blood natural killer (NK) cells, NK functional activity, cytokine levels, and hormone-binding proteins, all analyzed as pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. These results will inform the design of future large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of INM176 in delaying or preventing prostate cancer recurrence.
