Robot-Assisted or Laparoscopic Resection for Gastric Subepithelial Tumor With Hand-Sewn Repair, a Case Series
There are a lot of surgical techniques in minimally-invasive surgery to remove gastric subepithelium tumor. Surgical approach depend on location and size of tumor. Usefully used Endostapler to cut stomach include lesion. For tumors in difficult locations some surgeons prefer laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperation or use the intragastric port technique to identify and remove the mass. But in complex procedures, gastotomy and hand sawn to identify and remove gastric subepithelium tumor is a simple technique and easy to apply. This study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of this technique.
Gastric Mass
PROCEDURE: Hand-Sewn Repair
Post operative complication, anastomosis leak, 7 day|Post operative compliction, wound infection, 7 day
Surgical outcome, Complete remove mass with out rupture, 7 day
: A retrospective chart review was made of all patients who presented with gastric subepithelial tumor and underwent laparoscopic or robotic resection at Ramathibodi Hospital during 2012-2018. Surgical outcomes and complication of gastotomy and hand-sewn repair were analyzed.
