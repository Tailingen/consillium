Study on the Clinical Efficacy of Teclistamab
The aim of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of the anti-BCMA/CD3 bispecific antibody teclistamab (Tecvayli®) in a prospective, real-life setting in Belgium.
Multiple Myeloma|Hematologic Diseases
DRUG: Teclistamab
Overall response rate, The primary objective is the overall response rate (partial response (PR) or better) according to the 2016 IMWG response criteria of Multiple myeloma., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)
Progression-free survival (PFS), The length of time during and after the treatment during which a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Overall survival (OS), Duration of time between start of the treatment and up to the time of death., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Incidence of (serious) adverse events, Incidence and severity of (serious) adverse events with with focus on hematological AE's (≥ grade 3), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) rate, Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and infections (≥ grade 2) and serious adverse events related to teclistamab (Tecvayli®)., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Depth of response, Evaluation of response in terms of depth. Assessment of response according to the 2016 IMWG response criteria of Multiple myeloma., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Time to response (TTR), Assessment of the time it takes for a patient to achieve partial response (PR) or better., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Duration of response, Assessment of the length of time during which a patient experiences a partial response (PR) or better. It is measure from the start of treatment until disease progression or death., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) assessment, Evaluation of treatment efficacy by monitoring for the presence of a small number of cancer cells that are left in the body. MRD assessment will be done with Next Gen Flow (NGF) or Next Gen Sequencing (NGS)., At suspected CR, every 6 months thereafter until end of study (maximum 24 months)|Time to next treatment (TTNT), Assessment of the time interval between initiation of treatment with Tecvayli® and commencement of the next line of therapy., At baseline, monthly until end of study (maximum 24 months)
To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of teclistamab (Tecvayli®) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients who have received at least 3 prior lines of treatment and who will receive teclistamab (Tecvayli®) as the next treatment. Patients will be followed up prospectively until the end of study (24 months/2 years), or until disease progression, withdrawal of consent death or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first. Each patient will have a monthly follow-up from baseline until 6 months of treatment with teclistamab. Then, data will be collected every 3 months until the end of study.
