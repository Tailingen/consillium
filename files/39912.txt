Duration of clinical benefit, Duration of Clinical Benefit (DoCB) in patients undergoing EV schedule de-escalation in the EV monotherapy cohort. DoCB is defined as time from initiating treatment to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete response, partial response, or stable disease (per RECIST v1.1), 8 months
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing EV schedule de-escalation in the EV monotherapy cohort, 5 years|Time to next treatment, Time to Next Treatment in patients undergoing EV schedule de-escalation in the EV monotherapy, 5 years
This is a non-randomized two arm open-label phase 2 pilot study in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The study will investigate an alternative administration schedule of EV given as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled to the main EV monotherapy cohort who are scheduled to receive EV as standard of care. Additionally, an exploratory arm will enroll 20 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who are scheduled to receive EV in combination with pembrolizumab as standard of care. All subjects will have histologically and radiographically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2, and meet baseline laboratory data as outlined in the section 4.1.
