Accuracy of Coplanar Template Assistance for Abdominal Tumor Puncture
In recent years, template guidance has been applied and developed in the field of puncture related operations, such as template-assisted radioactive seed implantation. With the guidance of template, needle pathway of seed implantation, biopsy and fiducial marker implantation can be precisely planned actual operation, which is conducive to the accurate proceeding. Templates can be divided into coplanar templates and non-coplanar templates. The digital coplanar template coordinate puncture system has been developed in China and has been applied in clinical practice.

In our previous studies, coplanar template assisted CT-guided radioactive seed implantation has good clinical feasibility for percutaneous biopsy of small pulmonary nodules. However, the accuracy of coplanar template assistance for abdominal tumor puncture are lacking in prospective studies. The study aims to prospectively observe the accuracy and safety of coplanar template assisted CT-guided abdominal tumor puncture during biopsy and fiducial markers implantation.
