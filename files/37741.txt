A Window of Opportunity Study to Investigate Mechanisms of Actions of Novel Therapeutic Agents in Patients With Resectable Solid Tumor Malignancies
This is a single-institution, single arm, open label, window of opportunity clinical trial that will act as a Master Protocol with a primary objective to assess pharmacodynamic effects of the novel study drugs in subjects with resectable solid tumor malignancies.

Each Sub-protocol conducted under the Master Protocol will evaluate different novel therapeutic agent(s).

Estimated enrollment is 15 subjects per Sub-Protocol.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Epacadostat
Pharmacodynamic effects as measured by changes in biomarkers in pre- and post-dose tumor and blood specimens, To establish baseline levels and measure pharmacodynamic biomarker changes in tumor and/or blood samples after treatment with the study drug.

Sub- Protocol A will focus on changes in CD8+ T cells, CD4+Foxp3+ cells, NK cells, DCs and immune checkpoints., Approximately 1 year
Safety and tolerability as measured by incidence of AEs (Adverse Events), To assess the safety and tolerability of the study drug in the pre-surgical setting graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0., Approximately 1 year|Pathological Response Rate as measured by correlation of biomarkers in tumor and/or blood specimens, To evaluate pathological response rate of solid tumor malignancies in subjects receiving neo-adjuvant treatment with the study drug and to assess a possible correlation with biomarkers either in the tumor specimens either in the bloods samples and the pathological response., Approximately 1 year|Overall Survival, To determine the overall survival (OS) status of subject treated which the study drug at 6 months, 1 year and 2 year, Approximately 2 years
Patients will have a short-course (4-weeks) administration of a given compound in the timeframe between the diagnostic biopsy and the surgical resection. A pre-treatment tumor biopsy will be obtained, and blood samples will be collected before, during, and at the end of treatment.
