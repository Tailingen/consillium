Combination of Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine Induction Chemotherapy and Intensity-modulated radiotherapyIntensity-modulated Radiotherapy With or Without Concurrent Cisplatin for NPC
Concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus radiotherapy increased the risk of treatment-related death and severe acute toxicity. The survival benefit of adding concurrent chemotherapy to intensity modulated radiation in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is unclear. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy combine with radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated by patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Inductive chemotherapy + concurrent cisplatin and IMRT|DRUG: Inductive chemotherapy + IMRT
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 3-year|Failure-free survival, Failure-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first failure at any site., 3-year|Locoregional failure-free survival, the latency to the first local failure, 3-year|Distant failure-free survival, The latency to the first remote failure, 3-year
Difference in the complete response rates between the two treatment arms, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy
Rates of toxicity, Rates of toxicity will also be compared. Rates will be compared by the chi-square test.The Chemotherapy toxicity include thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia , anemia, granulocytopenia,damage to hepatic function, damage to renal function,constipation, diarrhea,vomiting and rash. The radiotherapy toxicities include mucositis, radiation dermatitis,dysphagia, xerostomia, skin fibrosis, trismus, hearing loss ane cranial neuropathy., 3-years
The purpose of this study is to compare gemcitabine plus cisplatin induction chemotherapy combine intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in order to reevaluate the value of concurrent cisplatin when 4 cycles induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine+cisplatin) and IMRT is used.
