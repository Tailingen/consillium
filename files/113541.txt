The Accuracy of Brain Biological Electrical Impedance Tomography Screen for Supratentorial Tumors
Compared with MRI or CT, brain biological electrical impedance tomography were performed on patients with supratentorial tumors and healthy people . The AUC (area under the curve) of ROC, which is associated with the increased maximum and the difference between left and right equilibrium of impedance value, is calculated. The specificity of brain biological electrical impedance tomography in screening supratentorial tumors are evaluated.

To compare the changes of parameters detected by brain biological electrical impedance tomography, the enrolled brain tumor patients with cerebral edema were paired with themselves and intravenous infusion of mannitol so that the sensitivity of this device in monitoring cerebral edema can be evaluated.
