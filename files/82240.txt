A Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab With or Without Sacituzumab Tirumotecan (MK- 2870) in Adult Participants With Resectable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Not Achieving Pathological Complete Response (pCR) (MK-2870-019)
This study will assess if adding sacituzumab tirumotecan with pembrolizumab after surgery is effective in treating NSCLC for participants not achieving pathological complete response. The primary hypothesis of this study is sacituzumab tirumotecan plus pembrolizumab is superior to pembrolizumab monotherapy with respect to disease free survival (DFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Sacituzumab tirumotecan|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Rescue medication
Disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), DFS is defined as the time from randomization to any recurrence (local, locoregional, regional or distant), occurrence of new primary NSCLC, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~ 93 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~ 118 months|Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as assessed by investigator, DMFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented distant metastasis or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Distant metastasis refers to cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to distant organs or distant lymph nodes., Up to ~ 118 months|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) as assessed by investigator, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to any recurrence (local, locoregional, regional or distant), occurrence of new primary NSCLC, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~ 118 months|Lung Cancer Specific Survival (LCSS), LCSS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to lung cancer., Up to ~ 118 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to ~ 118 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to AEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to ~ 118 months|Change from Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) score (Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 Items 29 and 30), The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer patients in oncology studies. Each scale or item is scored between 0 and 100, for the global health status or QoL a higher value indicates a better level of function., Baseline and up to ~118 months|Change from Baseline in Physical Functioning Score (QLQ-C30 Items 1 to 5), The EORTC-QLQ is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing the HRQoL of cancer patients in oncology studies. Each scale or item is scored between 0 and 100, for all physical functional scales, a higher value indicates a better level of function., Baseline and up to ~118 months|Change from Baseline in Role Functioning Score (QLQ-C30 Items 6 and 7), The EORTC-QLQ is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing the HRQoL of cancer patients in oncology studies. Each scale or item is scored between 0 and 100, for all role functional scales, a higher value indicates a better level of function., Baseline and up to ~118 months|Change from Baseline in Dyspnea scores (QLQ-C30 Item 8), The EORTC-QLQ is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing the HRQoL of cancer patients in oncology studies. Each scale or item is scored between 0 and 100, for symptom scales such as dyspnea, a higher value indicates increased severity of symptoms., Baseline and up to ~118 months|Change from Baseline in Coughing scores (QLQ-LC24 Items 31 and 52), The lung cancer module of the EORTC, QLQ-LC24 is a revised and updated version of the Lung Cancer Module QLQ-LC13 and is a supplementary lung cancer specific module to be used along with EORTC QLQ C30. The QLQ-LC24 incorporates 4 multi-item scales to assess coughing, shortness of breath, hair problems, and fear of progression, for symptom scales as for cough, a higher value indicates increased severity of symptoms., Baseline and up to ~118 months|Change from Baseline in Chest pain scores (QLQ-LC24 Item 40), The lung cancer module of the EORTC, QLQ-LC24 is a revised and updated version of the Lung Cancer Module QLQ-LC13 and is a supplementary lung cancer specific module to be used along with EORTC QLQ C30. The QLQ-LC24 incorporates 4 multi-item scales to assess coughing, shortness of breath, hair problems, and fear of progression, for symptom scales as for chest pain, a higher value indicates increased severity of symptoms., Baseline and up to ~118 months
