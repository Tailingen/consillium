PD-1 Blockade Combined With Definitive Chemoradiation in Locoregionally-advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This trial plans to enroll 40 patients with stage III-IVA (AJCC 8th, except T3N0-1 or T4N0) locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients will receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and concurrent cisplatin-radiation. All patients will receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Sintilimab will begin on day 1 of induction chemotherapy and continue every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.
