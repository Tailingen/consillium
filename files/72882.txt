Early Surgery or Standard Palliative Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: The primary tumor might be a source of re-seeding of distant sites and therefore elimination of this source of metastasizing cells by early local therapy may be of benefit.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying early surgery to see how well it works compared to standard palliative therapy in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer.

3-year Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. All patients will be followed for survival through 5 years. Cases with incomplete follow-up or without record of vital status will be censored at the date of last contact. 3-year OS rate was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Assessed at baseline, then every 3 months within 2 years and every 6 months between 2-5 years, up to 5 years
3-year Cumulative Incidence of Locoregional Recurrence/Progression, For patients in arm II (early local therapy), time to locoregional recurrence was defined as time from randomization to date of locoregional recurrence; for patients in arm A (continued systemic therapy), time to locoregional progression was defined as time from randomization to date of locoregional progression. In this study, locoregional recurrence was defined as the new development or clinically significant increase in size of any supraclavicular, infraclavicular, internal mammary or axillary adenopathy or chest wall disease or invasive in-breast recurrence for patients on arm B; for patients on arm A, locoregional progression was defined as the development of symptoms leading to a decision for local therapy. Locoregional recurrence/progression and distant progression were followed separately in the study, and the occurrence of one did not preclude the other getting reported. 3-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence/progression was estimated., Assessed at baseline, then every 3 months within 2 years and every 6 months between 2-5 years, up to 5 years|Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL), The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Trial Outcome Index (FACT-B TOI) was used as the primary HRQL endpoint, measured by the prorated aggregate score of the 24 items from the FACT-B (7 functional well-being, 7 physical well-being, 10 breast cancer specific items). The theoretical range of the prorated aggregate score was 0-96, higher scores indicate better quality of life., Assessed at 18 months after randomization
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate whether early local therapy of intact primary disease in patients with Stage IV breast cancer whose disease does not progress during initial optimal systemic therapy, will result in prolonged survival, compared to patients who receive local therapy for palliation only.

Secondary

* To compare the time to uncontrolled chest wall disease between patients who receive early local therapy versus patients who receive palliative local therapy.
* To determine whether there is a difference in health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) between patients who receive early local therapy versus patients who receive palliative local therapy.
* To determine whether the absolute value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) burden at 6 months following randomization (time +6) will be lower in the palliative therapy arm than in early local therapy arm, and whether this value is inversely related to survival (lower CTC, longer survival).

Exploratory

* To collect tumor and blood specimens for future exploration of the biological interactions between the primary tumor and metastatic lesions and the effect of primary tumor resection.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor and treatment plan (ER+ or PR+, HER2-, endocrine therapy alone vs ER+ or PR+, and HER2-, chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy vs ER- or PR-, and HER2- vs HER2+), and number of involved organ systems with distant disease (regional nodes in the axillary, supraclavicular, and internal mammary locations are not considered distant sites) (1 vs \> 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in 1:1 ratio.

* Arm I: Patients receive standard palliative therapy, if needed, to address symptoms such as tumor ulceration, pain, bulky adenopathy causing arm symptoms, and other similar situations. Therapy may consist of radiotherapy alone, surgery alone, or a combination of both.
* Arm II: Patients undergo surgery comprising breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or total mastectomy according to patient and treating physician preference. Surgery is to occur no later than 10 weeks after completion of 32 weeks of systemic therapy. Free surgical margins must be achieved with re-excision or mastectomy for patients undergoing BCT. After completion of BCT, patients undergo radiotherapy once a day, 5 days per week. Patients who had mastectomy undergo radiotherapy at the discretion of treating physician.

Patients may undergo blood and tumor tissue sample collection for circulating tumor cells (CTC) burden and future studies.

Patients complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Trial Outcome Index (FACT- TOI) and FACT - General (22) and the Breast Cancer Subscale (FACT-B) quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
