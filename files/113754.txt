Proton Cranio-spinal Irradiation for Leptomeningeal Metastasis
Leptomeningeal metastasis is a rare but serious complication to cancer, with a grave prognosis. No efficient treatment exists.

Recent data suggest that craniospinal radiotherapy lead to superior survival and CNS control compared to focal photon radiotherapy. We want to offer Danish patients the new treatment, but within a protocol, as this is new data with an new treatment principle
Leptomeningeal Metastasis
RADIATION: CSI
CNS control, local control, 6 months
overall survival, actuarial, 1 year|CNS-PFS dependent on tumor site, progression free survival, actuarial, 1 year|Symptomatology, New symptoms, CTC AE 5.0 grade \>=3, 1 year
Patients must be referred from Danish Departments of Oncology with radiotherapy service.

Patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from both solid and hematological cancers will be offered proton radiotherapy with 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the entire craniospinal axis. Patients will be followed with registration of side effects, neurology and MRI scans every 3 months until 1 year.
