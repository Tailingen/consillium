Grade 3=Severe; Grade 4=Life-threatening., From first dose (Day 1) till 100 days after last dose (Up to approximately 27 months)|Part 2C: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed Best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by RECIST v1.1.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \\\< 10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From first dose (Day 1) and up to 24 weeks|Part 2C: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for participants who have a confirmed CR or PR as the date from first documented CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 to the date of the documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \\\< 10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From first dose (Day 1) and up to 24 weeks|Part 2C: Progression Free Survival Rate at Week 24, Progression Free Survival Rates at 24 weeks is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve PFS at 24 weeks. PFS for a participant is defined as the time from randomization date to the date of first objectively documented disease progression by investigator per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates.

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum during the study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., Week 24
