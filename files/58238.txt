Vaccination of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new investigational cancer vaccine, P10s-PADRE in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in patients with clinical stage I, II or III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study will compare the vaccine plus standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone.

BIOLOGICAL: P10s-PADRE with MONTANIDE™ ISA 51 VG|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Safety and Tolerability Adverse Events, A Safety/Tolerability Event is defined as the occurrence of one of the following:

* A Serious Adverse Event, OR
* A non-Serious Adverse Event of Grade = 3, 4, or 5, OR
* A non-Serious Adverse Event of Grade = 2 whose Relationship to P10s-PADRE Vaccine was classified as Definite, Probable, or Possible, From the start of treatment to the time of definitive surgery (4-8 weeks after chemo); from Week 0 to Week 20-23|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), A tumor-response call of either ypT0N0 or ypTisN0 determined through surgical staging after neoadjuvant therapy. The staging system used to determine the tumor-response call is the AJCC Staging System described in a 2014 FDA Guidance for Industry.

• A tumor-response call of "pyT0N0" is also equated with pCR in the published literature., During and/or Immediately After Surgery|Pathological Tumor Size, Tumor size at surgery/pathology report, Surgery|Pathological Node Status: Number of Positive Lymph Nodes, Number of positive lymph nodes found out of dissected lymph nodes, Surgery|Pathological Node Status: Number of Dissected Lymph Nodes, Number of dissected lymph nodes at surgery for study participants, Surgery|Tumor Response, Participants had their tumors surgically removed and pathologically staged using the AJCC Staging criteria. The main method of pathologic staging for breast cancer is the TNM system which stands for (Tumor size, lymph Node status and Metastases). "yp" prior to TN means the tissue was staged after neoadjuvant therapy. The larger the number after "T" means the larger the size, and the larger the number after "N" means the number of affected nearby lymph nodes. Therefore, tumor gradings with T3Nx are worse than those with T0Nx. The two categories "pyT0N0" and "ypT0N0" are both considered to be synonymous with pCR in the published literature., Surgery

Values were averaged for the percent of CD8 T cells., Weeks 1, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23, and 46|Frequencies of Cells - CD69+/CD3+, Using flow cytometry, the frequencies of CD69+/CD3+ cells were determined for samples collected from multiple timepoints from Week 1 to Week 70. Values were averaged for the percent of CD69 T cells., Weeks 1, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23, 46, and 70|Frequencies of Circulating Regulatory T Cells (Tregs), Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from samples collected from multiple timepoints from Week 1 to Week 46. Using flow cytometry, the frequencies of Tregs (CD4, CD25 and CD127) were analyzed for separately, and then summed. The units are reported in CD4+CD25+CD127 low/- percentage because CD127 is a recently discovered antigen associated with Tregs that is weakly expressed on Tregs, while the self-activated memory T cell CD127 is strongly expressed; therefore, CD4+CD25+CD127 low/- is used to represent Tregs now., Weeks 1, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23, 46, and 70|Activation Profiles of NK Cells: CD16, The expression levels of activation markers on NK cells profile, specifically CD16, were determined for samples collected from multiple timepoints from Week 1 to Week 70.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinical stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative and HER2-negative (= triple negative - TN) breast cancer. P10s-PADRE will be administered with MONTANIDE™ ISA 51 VG as adjuvant. Human breast cancers that express Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) can be immunogenic, and enhancing the anti-TACA antibodies and immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of standard therapies.

A randomized two-arm, open-label, multi-center phase I/II trial is designed with the goal being to evaluate the efficacy of combining vaccination of the P10s-PADRE formulation with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to standard chemotherapy plus P10s-PADRE or to standard chemotherapy alone. Efficacy will be based on the rate of pathologic Complete Response (pCR) observed among TN breast-cancer patients treated with the combination as compared with the group of patients who receive standard chemotherapy alone.
