Tislelizumab Plus Cetuximab and Irinotecan vs Third-line Standard-of-care in Refractory mCRC
This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with cetuximab and irinotecan（group A） compared to third-line regimens selected by researchers（group B） in the treatment of Ras wild-type recurrent and refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. This study will include Ras wild-type colorectal cancer that failed at least second-line treatment inthe past, including chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil) with or without targeted drugs (cetuximab, bevacizumab). 87 patients will be randomly assigned to group A and group B according to 2:1. The enrollment time is expected to be 12 months and the follow-up is expected to be 24 months.
