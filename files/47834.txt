Erectile Dysfunction/Prostate/RT/Androgen
The optimal duration of hormonal therapy is yet to be determined in the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. The RTOG performed a trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent hormones(consisting of Goserelin and Flutamide) compared to radiation alone, and found that there was an improvement in local control and progression-free survival, but no improvement in overall survival. The EORTC performed a similar trial, but used Goserelin alone for a period of 3 years. This trial showed an improvement in local control, disease-free survival, and in contrast to the RTOG trial, an improvement in overall survival.

The rate of erectile dysfunction in men who receive a prolonged period of Gosereline (i.e. 2 yrs) is not known, but suspected according to expert opinion, to be significantly higher than a shorter course of hormonal ablation. Therefore the price of of a survival advantage in locally advanced prostate cancer maybe at a cost of increased rates of erectile dysfunction.
Prostatic Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Erectile Dysfunction
This study is designed to address absolute incidence of erectile dysfunction, as measured by the International index of Erectile function.
This study is designed to address the effects of erectile dysfunction persist one year after the initial assessment of erectile dysfunction,as measured by the International index of Erectile function.
