Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Rituximab in Treating Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without rituximab for relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy and rituximab to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the response rate and quality of remission in patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) with or without rituximab.
* Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Determine the effect of rituximab as maintenance therapy on progression-free survival of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

* Induction: Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior treatment with purine analogues, age, number of prior induction treatments and best response obtained (complete vs partial remission vs no change/progressive disease), time since diagnosis (less than 2 years vs more than 2 years), and bulky disease (less than 10 cm vs greater than 10 cm).

  * Arm I (closed as of 12/20/04): Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5 (CHOP chemotherapy). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  * Arm II: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy as in arm I. Rituximab IV is administered 1 hour after prednisone and before the IV drugs.
* Maintenance: Patients who achieve partial or complete remission are then randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients are stratified according to rituximab administration during induction (yes vs no), quality of the response (complete vs partial remission vs no change/progressive disease), and participating center.

  * Arm I: Patients receive no further therapy.
  * Arm II: Beginning 8 weeks after the last CHOP course, patients receive rituximab IV once every 3 months for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 4 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 752 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
