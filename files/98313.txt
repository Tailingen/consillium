Efficacy of Recombinant Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Vaccine in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Cancer Who Had Residual EBV DNA Load After Conventional Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (clinical benefit rate) of MVA EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and its impact on disease progression.
Nasopharyngeal Cancer|Epstein-Barr Virus Infections
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Vaccine
Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate (CBR, percent of patients experiencing complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\] or stable disease \[SD\] for at least 12 weeks from post cycle 2 to cycle 6 measurements) determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), or by immune-related Response criteria (irRC) in the absence of measurable disease., 2 Years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) from post cycle 2 to cycle 6 measurements according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), relative to the total evaluable patient population., 2 Years|Duration of Response (DR), DR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumour response to the first documentation of objective tumour progression or to death due to any cause., 2 Years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from post cycle 2 measurement to first documentation of objective tumour progression, or to death due to any cause., 3 Years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause., 3 Years
