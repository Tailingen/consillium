Combination of Docetaxel + Estramustine + Hydrocortisone Versus Docetaxel + Prednisone in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
To compare the efficacy of both strategies (reference treatment: Docetaxel+Prednisone and experimental treatment: Docetaxel+Estramustine+Hydrocortisone) by means of PSA values.

To determine the time to treatment failure in both strategies To determine the overall and specific cause survival To evaluate the safety profile To analyze the Quality of Life
