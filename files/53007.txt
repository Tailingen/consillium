A Study of Surufatinib as Adjuvant Therapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
pNENs still have a risk of recurrence after radical resection, and the overall recurrence and metastasis rate is as high as 13.7%-36.2% in China. At present, there is no standard adjuvant therapy for pNEN, and prospective studies are still lacking. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of surufatinib in the adjuvant treatment of pNET, in order to further improve the prognosis of patients and to provide high-quality research evidence for adjuvant therapy.
