Studying Genes Using Cord Blood and Placenta Samples From Relatively Healthy Newborns and Samples From Younger Patients With Wilms Tumor
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from newborns and from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies cord blood and placenta tissue from newborns, and tumor tissue samples from patients with Wilms tumor.

Frequency of loss of imprinting at birth|Association between methylation levels and gene expression
OBJECTIVES:

* What is the frequency of loss of imprinting at birth (in the cord blood and placenta) in a relatively healthy birth cohort?
* Does deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation levels at imprinting genes have a direct association to the gene expression?

OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue, cord blood, and placenta samples are analyzed for DNA methylation, single nucleotide polymorphism, and gene expression by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pyrosequencing, and quantitative real-time PCR. Information regarding gender and age of the samples are also collected, if possible.
