CHFR Methylation Status Esophageal Cancer Study
This is a Phase 2 Study of Paclitaxel with Cisplatin versus Fluoropyrimidine with a Platinum Agent for Neoadjuvant Therapy in Operable Esophageal Cancer Based on CHFR Methylation Status in Diagnostic Biopsies.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Esophagectomy
Pathological Complete Response, CHFR methylation status correlates with response to taxane containing platinum-based combination therapy and tumor response involving operable Esophageal Cancer. Perform analysis comparing detection of CHFR in tumor and plasma., 3 years
Survival, Overall survival with given treatment strategy., 3 years|Time to Disease Progression, To determine time to disease progression with this treatment strategy., 3 years|Esophageal Tumor CHFR Methylation and Detection in Plasma, To determine the agreement between tumor CHFR methylation and detection in plasma., 3 years
Primary Objectives

â€¢ To determine the rate of pathological complete response when the inclusion of paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy is based on the presence or absence of CHFR methylation in diagnostic biopsy specimens.

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the survival outcome with this treatment strategy.
* To determine time to disease progression with this treatment strategy.
* To determine the agreement between tumor CHFR methylation and detection in plasma.
