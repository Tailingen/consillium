Green Tea in Breast Cancer Patients
Prognostic factors for breast cancer beyond stage at diagnosis and tumor characteristics have not been well studied. Of special interest are lifestyle factors that can be modified by women after diagnosis to increase disease-free survival. Green tea is rich in polyphenols consisting primarily of epicatechins, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The investigators hypothesize that there will be a reduction in proliferation and/or an increase in apoptosis in association with short-term EGCG treatment.
