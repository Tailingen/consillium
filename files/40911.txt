Phase 1b Safety Study of Xevinapant, Weekly Cisplatin, and RT in Participants With Unresected LA SCCHN (HyperlynX)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Xevinapant when added to weekly cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the treatment of participants with unresectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, suitable for definitive chemoradiotherapy.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Xevinapant|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
Number of Participants with Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)-like events, From Day 1 up to 5 Weeks
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-Related AEs (TRAE), From Day 1 up to 18 weeks (Each cycle is of 3 Weeks)|Absolute values and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), From Screening up to Cycle 3 Day 4 (Day 67)|Objective Response (OR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria as assessed by Investigator, Time from first administration of study intervention until Progressive Disease (PD) or death, whichever is earlier assessed approximately up to 1.6 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST version 1.1 Criteria as Assessed by Investigator, Time from first administration of study intervention until PD or death, whichever is earlier assessed approximately up to 1.6 years|Locoregional Control (LRC) According to RECIST version 1.1 Criteria As assessed by Investigator, LRC is defined as the time from date of the first treatment until date of the first occurrence of progression at the site of the primary tumor or the locoregional lymph nodes., From randomization to the earliest between PFS event (progression at the site of the primary tumor or the locoregional lymph nodes) or End of Study assessed approximately up to 1.6 years|Time to Subsequent Systemic Cancer Treatments, From randomization to the earliest between PFS event (progression at the site of the primary tumor or the locoregional lymph nodes) or End of Study, assessed approximately up to 1.6 years
