Prospective Registry of Patients With Pancreas Adenocarcinoma Resectable and Borderline
Unlike other types of gastrointestinal tumors, there is controversial evidence of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline and resectable adenocarcinoma (ADK) of the pancreas, the objective of this study is to perform a "snapshot" of the usual practice in our setting in terms of neoadjuvant therapy in ADK, both in terms of the different regimens used as well as the results in terms of morbidity, mortality and survival.

Likewise, in a second phase, a prospective registry of patients included in the neoadjuvant regimen for both resectable and borderline ADK diagnosed in Catalonia will be launched, which will provide us with valuable information to try to answer open questions in the context of borderline and resectable ADK treatment.
