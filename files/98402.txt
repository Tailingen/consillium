Ph II Nintedanib vs. Ifosfamide in Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This is a prospective, multicentric, randomized, open label Phase II trial investigating whether the oral angiogenesis inhibitor nintedanib, as compared to the intravenous cytotoxic compound ifosfamide, given for patients with advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS after failure of first line chemotherapy prolongs progression-free survival.

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate whether nintedanib given as second-line therapy for advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS prolongs progression-free survival when compared with ifosfamide.

Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib as compared to ifosfamide in terms of progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks, overall survival, objective response rate, patient benefit rate, response duration, total duration of treatment with nintedanib safety, Health related Quality of Life and Health Economics.

Exploratory objectives include an analysis of putative predictive biomarkers for the anti-tumor effects of the investigational agent nintedanib.treatment.
