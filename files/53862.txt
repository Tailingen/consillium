Treating NSCLC Minimal Stage IV With Curative Intent
It is the hypothesis of this protocol that a subset of NSCLC patients with stage IVa disease can benefit from curative therapy and extends beyond the very limited subset of oligometastatic patients that have already been studied.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Induction chemotherapy and concurrent radiation|OTHER: Consolidation: Radiation therapy to metastatic sites
Overall survival, Measure time of survival from enrollment to death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months., Anticipated medial survival time is 8 - 10 months, however, all participants will be followed until death, assessed up to 100 months.
New metastatic disease, Measure of time from patient entry to time of new disease or progression of disease or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months., Anticipated time to progression is unknown, however, all patients will be followed for survival, up to 100 months.
In this study, patiently will be aggressively treated with 4 cycles of full dose platinum-based chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy to the primary tumor and identified mediastinal lymph nodal metastatic drainage. Local curative radiation will then target the oligometastatic tumor sites.
