Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase 1, open label clinical trial of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Autologous Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Safety and Tolerability of Autologous Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes Therapy, day0, day3, week1, week2, week4, week12, week24
Concentration of Total Bilirubin (TBIL, mg/dL), Total bilirubin refers to the concentration of bilirubin in a patient's blood sample, which is automatically measured by the laboratories in accordance with standard operating procedures., day0, day3, week1, week2, week4, week12, week24|Child-Turcotte-Pugh(CTP) score, CTP score is currently the most commonly used model to evaluate liver reserve function and prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. This model evaluates liver function based on HE grade, degree of abdominal fluid accumulation, bilirubin (TBiL), albumin (Alb) and prothrombin time (PT). The score ranges from 0 to 15, with the higher the score, the worse the prognosis., day0, day3, week1, week2, week4, week12, week24|Quality of life of patients, Quality of life assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary Symptom Indexï¼Œ which has a score ranges 0-32, a higher score indicates better quality of life., day0, day3, week1, week2, week4, week12, week24
