BIOLOGICAL: HSC835
Safety and Tolerability of HSC835 for Clinical Use Were Measured by Infusional Toxicity (Within First 48 Hours After Transplant) and Absence of Graft Failure After 32 Days in Excess of That Currently Observed With UCBT., The safety and tolerability of HSC835 for clinical use were measured by infusional toxicity and absence of graft failure in excess of that currently observed with UCBT. Infusional toxicity - AE from transplant until first 48 hours. Administration of the HSC835 expanded CD34-positive cell product, infused over a period of approximately 15 minutes may theoretically cause adverse reactions based on hemodynamic effects, the release of factors like cytokines through administration into the systemic circulation, or acute hypersensitivity, among others., 32 days
Incidence of Neutrophil Recovery Within 42 Days, Neutrophil recovery (engraftment) is defined as the first of three consecutive days with ANC \> 0.5 x 109/L which occurred for all patients before 42 days post transplant., 42 days|Incidence of Platelet Recovery Within Six Months, Incidence of platelet recovery within six months. Number of participants recovering platelet to ≥50,000 × 109/L for at least one week without transfusion in the prior 7 days to the first measurement., 6 months|Frequency of Expanded Unit Predominance at Day 100 (DUCBT Recipients Only), Frequency of expanded unit predominance at day 100 (DUCBT recipients only) unit predominance was assessed by differences in microsatellite patterns between the recipient, HSC835 and the unmanipulated cord blood unit. Evaluation of sorted CD15-positive/CD33-positive myeloid and CD3-positive T cells in the peripheral blood, revealed three patterns: predominance of HSC835, Mixed dominance an unique chimerism pattern was observed with the CD15/CD33 population predominantly derived from HSC835 and the CD3 population almost exclusively derived from the unmanipulated unit, and predominance of the unmanipulated unit, Day 100|Incidence of Transplant Related Mortality (TRM) Within 100 Days and One Year, Number of participants with incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) within 100 days and one year, Day 100 and Month 12|Incidence of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) Within 100 Days and Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) Within 1 Year, Number of participants with incidence of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) within 100 days and Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) within 1 year, Day 100 and Monnth 12|Incidence of Relapse Within One Year, Number of participants with Incidence of relapse within one year, Month 12|Overall Survival (OS) Within One Year, Number of participants with Overall survival (OS) within one year, Month 12|Disease Free Survival (DFS) Within One Year, Number of participants with Disease Free Survival (DFS) within one year. Patients are considered to have achieved DFS or relapse-free survival if they had not experienced either relapse or death (of any cause), Month 12
