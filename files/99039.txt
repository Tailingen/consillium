Real Word European Registry of NTRK Fusions and Other Rare Actionable Fusions (TRacKING)
This registry will make it possible to describe real life management of patients with rare actionable fusions and to better understand these cancers. In addition of clinical data from the medical files, a quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will be complete at inclusion, at each new treatment and then every 6 months. The patients will be followed for a period of at least 2 years after the inclusion.

This TRacKING registry is a European collaborative tool to improve the management of patients with actionable fusions, by sharing of data from rare tumor indications.

1. Administrative opening of the center
2. Routine identification of a patients harboring a rare actionable fusion
3. Patient's inclusion

   * Signature of written informed consent,
   * Declaration by the physician to the coordinating center (using the "Physician declaration" form)
   * Completion of the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (at inclusion, at each new treatment and then every 6 months).
4. Collection of retrospective and prospective data into the e-CRF by a local CRA using patients' medical files.
