Concordance of Inivata Liquid Biopsy With Standard of Care Tissue Testing
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis compared with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detection of genomic alterations in patients with advanced lung cancer.

Relationship of clinical response to therapy with mutation allele frequency (MAF) cutoff in Inivata liquid biopsy assay, 1 year
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis compared with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detection of genomic alterations in patients with advanced lung cancer. Once selected for the study and with full informed consent, patients will have a blood draw to allow the detection of cancer-related genomic alterations that are detectable within the blood sample. These results will be compared to results obtained from genomic profiling via standard tissue biopsy taken as part of routine care to help determine whether such 'liquid biopsies' can be used to guide treatments in future patients. The results of the liquid biopsy will not be used to guide treatment decisions in study participants.

In addition there is data-collection of treatments received for non small cell lung cancer and the response to these treatments during the first 6 months post tissue and blood analysis, though no additional visits or procedures are required for the patient beyond the initial blood draw.
