Onco-Genomas Brasil: Mapping Breast and Prostate Cancer in the Brazilian Public Health System
This project aims to perform complete sequencing of the somatic (tumor) and germline exomes during clinical investigation of cancer patients treated through the Brazilian Unified Health System to generate genomic and phenotypic data for the Brazilian Ministry of Health's National Precision Genomics and Health Program, called Genomas Brasil, as well as to collect data on the population's ancestry.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: whole exome and whole genome sequencing analysis
To characterize complete somatic and germline exomes/genomes in a Brazilian population, Mutations in the somatic and germline exomes/genomes of women with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer and of men with metastatic prostate cancer will be described, 12 months
To identify genetic variants related to tumor prognosis, Mutations in the somatic and germline exomes/genomes will be correlated to clinical outcomes, 12 months|To identify genetic variants predictive of response to treatments, Mutations in the somatic and germline exomes/genomes will be correlated to response to treatments, 12 months|Number of patients with mutations in cancer-predisposing genes, Identify mutations in germline exomes/genomes related to hereditary cancer syndromes, 12 months
To identify the ancestry of patients with breast and prostate cancer, Characterize the genomic ancestry of Brazilian patients with breast and prostate cancer, 12 months
In Brazil, the most frequent types of neoplasm are prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. Understanding the molecular variants in tumors, which result from mutations and variants that occur during carcinogenesis, can affect treatment response and disease prognosis and is an important target of oncology research. Detecting hereditary genetic syndromes also helps in oncological follow-up, allowing prediction of the risk of new neoplasms.
