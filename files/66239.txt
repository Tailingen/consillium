Refining the Role of Mid-induction Bone Marrow Biopsy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Pilot Study
The purpose of the study is to observe the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who do not receive an immediate second round of chemotherapy after undergoing a standard mid-induction bone marrow biopsy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
rates of complete remission, rates of complete remission in consecutive patients with AML, receiving standard induction chemotherapy, without intervening on the results of the mid-induction bone marrow biopsy., 28 days
This will be a pilot study that will include patients with AML receiving intensive induction therapy with 7+3 +/- a third agent (for any actionable cytogenetics or mutations). All patients will have a planned mid-induction bone marrow assessment as standard of care. All patients will subsequently be observed for count recovery, regardless of bone marrow results and in the absence of peripheral blood disease proliferation, and an end of induction bone marrow biopsy will be performed either at count recovery or between days 28 and 42 in the absence of count recovery. Patients with complete remission (CR) will proceed to consolidation chemotherapy as determined by the treating investigator. Patients with refractory disease will proceed to further therapy as determined by the treating investigator. All patients will be followed for long-term outcomes.
