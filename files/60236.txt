To Evaluate the Safety, Local Tolerability, PK and PD of LDE225 on Sporadic Superficial and Nodular Skin Basal Cell Carcinomas (sBCC)
This was a double-blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled study in sporadic superficial BCC (sBCC) and nodular BCC (nBCC) patients which consisted of a 21-day screening period, a treatment period of 6 weeks (topical 0.75% LDE225 cream application b.i.d) ending with post treatment biopsies, as safety visit one week after final study drug administration (Day 50), a visit on Day 83 for excision of the treated BCC, and an end of study evaluation (Day 90).
Sporadic Superficial and Nodular Skin Basal Cell Carcinomas
DRUG: LDE225 0.75%|DRUG: Vehicle
Clinical Evaluation of sBCCs Tumors, The clinical response parameters were defined as (i) complete response (i.e., there is no longer any visible evidence of a lesion consistent with BCC at this site), (ii) partial response (i.e., although a BCC still remains at this site, it has demonstrated a visible decrease in size compared with baseline), and (iii) no response / worsening (i.e., the BCC has not demonstrated any visible decrease in size compared with baseline)., Day 43
