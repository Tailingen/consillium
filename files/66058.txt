Clinical Study of KD6001 in Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of KD6001 as treatment for participants with advanced solid tumours.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: KD6001 Injection
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be assessed during the dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities., Up to Day 28|Incidence and nature of participants with adverse events (AEs), Evaluate the adverse events (AE) according to NCI CTCAE 5.0., Baseline until 30 days after last dose of KD6001|To determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of KD6001 in subjects with solid tumors, If more than or equal to one third of the participants at a dose level experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the MTD reassessed and the next lowest dose level for the combination therapy considered the MTD., Baseline to study completion up to 2 years
Antitumor activity measured by Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST)/Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Number of participants with response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. Descriptive statistics and graphical analysis will be used to summarize patients' demographic and clinicopathological characteristics, patient safety and efficacy outcomes and correlative markers., Baseline to study completion up to 2 years|To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of KD6001: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Serum concentrations of KD6001 in individual subjects at different time points after KD6001 administration, Baseline to study completion up to 2 years|To evaluate the immunogenicity of KD6001: Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of KD6001 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From baseline until 15 days after last dose of KD6001
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of KD6001 as treatment for participants with advanced solid tumours.
