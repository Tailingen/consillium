QUILT-3.090: NANT Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Vaccine: Subjects With SCC Who Have Progressed
This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination therapy in subjects with SCC who have progressed on or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Phase 2 will be based on Simon's two-stage optimal design.

Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), Graded Using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, 30 days after last dose, up to 15.5 months
Objective Response Rate by RECIST Version 1.1, Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response will be assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of target and non-target lesions in accordance with RECIST Version 1.1.

An objective response is defined as a confirmed complete or partial overall response with confirmation occurring at least 4 weeks after the initial response is observed., Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response will be assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase until disease progression, up to 11 months.|Objective Response Rate by irRC, Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response will be assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of target and non-target lesions in accordance with immune-related response criteria (irRC).

An objective response is defined as a confirmed complete or partial overall response with confirmation occurring at least 4 weeks after the initial response is observed., Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response will be assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase until confirmed disease progression, up to 11 months.|Progression Free Survival by RECIST Version 1.1., Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions PFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. PFS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurs first. Subjects completing study follow-up or initiating a new anticancer therapy prior to documented PD was censored in the PFS analysis at the last known date the subject was progression free prior to completing follow-up or initiating the new therapy., Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase until disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first, up to 11 months.|Progression Free Survival by irRC, PFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. PFS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurs first. Subjects completing study follow-up or initiating a new anticancer therapy prior to documented PD was censored in the PFS analysis at the last known date the subject was progression free prior to completing follow-up or initiating the new therapy., Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase until disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first, up to 11 months.|Overall Survival, OS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. OS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death (any cause). Participants who were alive at the end of follow-up were censored in the OS analysis at the last known date alive., Participants were assessed from screening to death.|Duration of Response (DOR) by RECIST Version 1.1 and irRC, DOR was defined as the time from the date of first response (PR or CR) to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first. Responding subjects completed study follow-up or initiated a new anticancer therapy prior to documented PD was censored in the DOR analysis at the last known date the subject was progression free prior completing follow-up or initiating the new therapy., Tumors were assessed at screening, and tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks during the induction phase, and every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase until disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first, up to 11 months.|Disease Control Rate (Confirmed Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease Lasting for at Least 2 Months) by RECIST Version 1.1, Disease control is defined as subjects with a confirmed CR, PR, or SD lasting for at least 2 months, Up to 11 months|Quality of Life (QoL) by Patient Reported Outcomes, QoL was conducted via PROs using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H\&N) or Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire. The FACT-H\&N and FACT-L compilation of general questions divided into five QoL subscales: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, and Additional Concerns.

It uses 5-point Likert-type response categories ranging from 0 = 'not at all' to 4 = 'very much'. Each subscale consists of 6-12 questions to answer., Up to 15.5 months|Disease Control Rate (Confirmed Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease Lasting for at Least 2 Months) by irRC, Disease control is defined as subjects with a confirmed CR, PR, or SD lasting for at least 2 months, Up to 11 months
Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease (SD) or an ongoing partial response (PR) at 1 year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. The duration of the maintenance phase can exceed 1 year if the subject continues to benefit, per the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. The time on study treatment, including both the induction and maintenance phases, is up to 2 years. The duration of the study may exceed 2 years if the subject remains in the maintenance phase for more than 1 year, as described above.
