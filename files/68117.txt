Immunization With AFP + GM CSF Plasmid Prime and AFP Adenoviral Vector Boost in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To evaluate the safety, toxicity and immunological effects of adjuvant administration of an experimental therapy consisting on priming with three intramuscular administrations of a plasmid expressing human AFP (phAFP) together with a plasmid expressing human GM-CSF (phGM-CSF), followed by a single intramuscular boost with an AFP adenoviral vector (AdVhAFP) to patients with locoregionally pre-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
