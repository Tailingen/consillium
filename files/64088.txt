Trial of Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab +/- Everolimus for Patients With HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial will evaluate the impact of adding everolimus to the combination of weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of women with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either paclitaxel/bevacizumab/everolimus (Treatment Arm 1) or paclitaxel/ bevacizumab/placebo (Treatment Arm 2). Patients will be evaluated for response to treatment every 8 weeks; responding and/or stable patients will continue treatment, with re-evaluations every 8 weeks, until tumor progression or

intolerable toxicity occurs. Outcomes will be assessed for each treatment arm

separately. This trial is not intended to compare treatment arms primarily. Any such analyses are exploratory and will be conducted without adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to disease progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 8 weeks until progressive disease, expected average of 18 months
Number of Patients With Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Assessments will be made based on the analysis of reported incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, every 4 weeks until intolerable toxicity occurs|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The number of patients with observed complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, every 8 weeks until treatment discontinuation, expected average of 18 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as time between date of objective response and date of response to disease progression or death, as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Objective response is defined as either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 8 weeks until treatment discontinuation, expected average 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Assessed from Day 1 of study drug administration to date of death due to any cause., every 8 weeks until treatment discontinuation, expected average 6 months
