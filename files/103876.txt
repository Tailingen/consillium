Assessing Her2/Neu Expression in Gastric Cancer With Dual or Multiple Tumor Tissue Paraffin Blocks
One paraffin block is routinely used for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (Her2/neu) immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment. Here, investigators investigated if picking two or multiple paraffin blocks for Her2/neu evaluation is an economical, efficient and practical method, which may reduce false-negativity of Her2/neu IHC assessment due to intratumoral heterogeneity.
