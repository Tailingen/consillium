Chemotherapy (DA-EPOCH+/-R) and Targeted Therapy (Tafasitamab) for the Treatment of Newly-Diagnosed Philadelphia Chromosome Negative B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This phase II clinical trial tests a chemotherapy regimen (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with or without rituximab \[DA-EPOCH+/-R\]) with the addition of targeted therapy (tafasitamab) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Chemotherapy drugs, such as those in EPOCH+/-R, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Tafasitamab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by helping the body to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Adding tafasitamab to the DA-EPOCH+/-R regimen may work better than DA-EPOCH+/-R alone in treating newly diagnosed Ph- B-ALL.

Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD), Efficacy of the addition of tafasitamab (tafa) to dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with our without rituximab (DA-EPOCHÂ±R) will be assessed using the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) as measured by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in the University of Washington hematopathology lab. Will consider an absolute increase in the rate of MRD- after one cycle to 50% to be a signal of interest (i.e., increase from 28%)., After 1 cycle of treatment (each cycle = 21 days)
Rate of MRD, Measured by MFC. Will be assessed only descriptively, using means and associated confidence intervals for continuous measures, simple ratios and Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for binary measures, and either Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimates for time-to-event outcomes (depending on whether competing risks are present)., After 4 cycles of treatment (each cycle = 21 days)|Incidence of adverse events, Safety measured by the incidence of non-hematologic toxicities \>= grade 3 evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version (v) 5.0. Will be assessed only descriptively, using means and associated confidence intervals for continuous measures, simple ratios and Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for binary measures, and either Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimates for time-to-event outcomes (depending on whether competing risks are present)., Up to 5 years|Event-free survival (EFS), Will be assessed only descriptively, using means and associated confidence intervals for continuous measures, simple ratios and Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for binary measures, and either Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimates for time-to-event outcomes (depending on whether competing risks are present)., Up to 5 years|Relapse-free survival (RFS), Will be assessed only descriptively, using means and associated confidence intervals for continuous measures, simple ratios and Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for binary measures, and either Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimates for time-to-event outcomes (depending on whether competing risks are present)., Up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Will be assessed only descriptively, using means and associated confidence intervals for continuous measures, simple ratios and Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for binary measures, and either Kaplan-Meier or cumulative incidence estimates for time-to-event outcomes (depending on whether competing risks are present)., Up to 5 years
OUTLINE:

Patients receive etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine intravenously (IV) continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4 of each cycle, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 5 of each cycle, prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 of each cycle, and tafasitamab IV weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. CD20 positive patients also receive rituximab IV per guidelines on days 1 or 5 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration or biopsy, computed tomography (CT) scan, lumbar puncture and undergo blood sample and cerebrospinal fluid collection throughout the trial.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for 3 years (total follow-up time 5 years).
