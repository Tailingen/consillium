Pre-Clinical Models in Gynecological Tumors A Tissue Repository
The purpose of this study is to provide a repository for long-term storage of endometrial cancer tumor and normal tissue, ascites and serum. This material will be used in studies to better understand the molecular biology of endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Neoplasms|Uterine Neoplasms
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

This protocol will create a central repository for banking tumor and other tissues as well as serum from patients with uterine corpus tumors. In addition, this protocol will also serve as a central repository for serum and tissue to healthy post-menopausal and peri-menopausal controls.

There will be an "internal" bank. The internal bank will have samples available to UNM investigators.
