Genomic Investigation of Unusual Responders
Studies have shown that tumors from the same patient may respond very differently to the same therapeutic agents. This study aims to investigate the genetic basis of tumors that respond abnormally well or poorly to therapeutic agents in an effort to understand the fundamental genetic basis of this response. The present protocol seeks to retrospectively perform Exome, next-generation (DNA) sequencing and/or other molecular techniques on tumor samples to identify the genetic basis of a patient's exceptional response to chemotherapy.
