Experimental Study to Evaluate the Impact of 18 Fluoro-PSMA (18F-PSMA) PET / CT in the Management of Patients with Prostate Cancer.
Single-center, prospective, open-label, not randomized, diagnostic phase II trial in the management of patients with prostate cancer.
18F-PSMA|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 18F-PSMA
Diagnostic role of 18F- PSMA PET /CT (sensitivity), Sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT will be calculated as the ratio between the number of 18F- PSMA PET/CT positive patients and number of patients with radically treated prostate cancer with biochemical relapse and negativity of traditional morphological imaging., Up to 30 months
Sensitivity for different PSA values (ranges), Sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT will be stratified respect to different ranges of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) values., Up to 30 months|Sensitivity for different lesion sites, Sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT will be stratified respect to different sites of lesion., Up to 30 months|predictive role of 18F-PSMA PET/CT on disease status according to standard imaging and PSA evaluation., To evaluate the predictive role of 18F-PSMA PET/CT on disease status, for patients that will start an anticancer treatment. It will be performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated by plotting sensitivity versus 1-specificity The best cut-off value for distinguishing between positive and negative 18F- PSMA PET/CT findings will be determined using Youden's index., Up to 30 months|evaluation of the concordance between 18F-PSMA PET/CT and other methods, To evaluate the concordance between 18F-PSMA PET/CT and PET/CT or the others standard methods, for patients without any treatment, it will be performed by Cohen's kappa coefficient, Up to 30 months|18F-PSMA Safety: treated patients undergoing grade 1 to 4 adverse event, Number and percentage of treated patients undergoing grade 1 to 4 adverse events will be tabulated according to CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 30 months
Single-center, prospective, open-label, not randomized, diagnostic phase II trial in the management of patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the additional diagnostic role of 18F- PSMA PET /CT (sensitivity) in patients with prostate cancer with biochemical relapse compared to other diagnostic methods routinely used. The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT defined as the ratio between the number of 18F-PSMA PET/CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging.Patients enrolled in the study would benefit from a more accurate but above all earlier diagnosis of disease recurrence sites, thus being able to undergo targeted therapies, with a clear impact on the clinical management of the disease.
