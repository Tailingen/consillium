A study to test the safety and effectiveness of Quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine against combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection and vaccine type-specific genital disease among Chinese females between the ages of 20 and 45.

Base Study: Combined Incidence of 6-Month Persistent Infection, Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN+), and External Genital Lesions Related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 20 to 45 Year Old Participants (Test of Hypothesis), The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of 6-month persistent infection, CIN+ (including CIN grade 1, 2, or 3, cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and cervical cancer), or external genital lesions related to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, or 18 detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in an adjacent section from the same tissue block., From Day 1 until >=25 cases accumulate, up to Month 30|Base Study: Combined Incidence of 6-Month Persistent Infection, CIN+, and External Genital Lesions Related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 20 to 26 Years Old Participants (Test of Hypothesis), The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of 6-month persistent infection, CIN+ (including CIN grade 1, 2, or 3, cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and cervical cancer), or external genital lesions related to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, or 18 detected by PCR in an adjacent section from the same tissue block., From Day 1 until >=17 cases accumulate, up to Month 30|Entire Study: Combined Incidence of CIN2+ Related to HPV Types 16 or 18 in 20 to 45 Year Old Participants (End of Study Test of Hypothesis), The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of CIN2+ (including CIN grade 2 or 3, AIS, and cervical cancer) related to HPV Types 16 or 18 detected by PCR in an adjacent section from the same tissue block., Up to Month 78|Base Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, is also an AE. Injection-site AEs were prompted on the Vaccination Report Card (VRC), which was completed by the participant for 15 days after each vaccination., Up to 15 days after any vaccination|Base Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Systemic Adverse Events, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, is also an AE., Up to 15 days after any vaccination|Base Study: Percentage of Participants Discontinued From Study Vaccination Due to an Adverse Event, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, is also an AE., Up to 6 months|Entire Study: Percentage of Participants With One or More Vaccine-related Serious Adverse Events, A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs a hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is an overdose or, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention. Related SAEs were those deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to study vaccine or a study procedure., Up to approximately 90 months|Entire Study: Percentage of Participants Who Died, The percentage of participants who died on study due to any cause, whether or not related to the investigational product, were reported for each arm, Up to approximately 90 months
Entire Study: Combined Incidence of 12-Month Persistent Infection, CIN+, and External Genital Lesions Related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 20 to 45 Year Old Participants (End of Study Update), The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of 12-month persistent infection, CIN+ (including CIN grade 1, 2, or 3, cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and cervical cancer), or external genital lesions related to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, or 18 detected by PCR in an adjacent section from the same tissue block., Up to 78 months|Entire Study: Combined Incidence of 12-Month Persistent Infection, CIN+, and External Genital Lesions Related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, 11, 16, or 18 in 20 to 26 Year Old Participants (End of Study Update), The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of 12-month persistent infection, CIN+ (including CIN grade 1, 2, or 3, cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and cervical cancer), or external genital lesions related to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, or 18 detected by PCR in an adjacent section from the same tissue block., Up to 78 months
The Base Study V501-041 duration was 30 months. The study was extended to further evaluate the efficacy of Quadrivalent HPV (Type 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP (qHPV) vaccine against Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2 (CIN 2), CIN 3, Adenocarcinoma In Situ (AIS), and/or cervical cancer. The efficacy was followed through the Month 78 visit, and the close-out visit was conducted at approximately Month 90 with only safety data collected
