Chemotherapy and DLI for Prevention of Second Relapse in Patients With Relapsed Acute Leukemia After Allotransplant
Patients with acute leukemia relapsing after allotransplant and who respond to anti-leukaemia interventions are at high-risk of a second relapse. Previous studies from investigators reported an association between a positive minimal residual disease (MRD)-test after transplant and an increased risk of subsequent relapse. Also, patients developing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after receiving DLI (donor lymphocyte infusion)for leukemia relapse after a first allotransplant have a lower likelihood of a second relapse compared with similar patients not developing chronic GvHD. And, our previous study also reported patients with chronic GvHD after DLI was associated with a greater frequency of a negative MRD-test and lower likelihood of subsequent relapse compared with similar persons not developing chronic GvHD. Based on these data the investigators designed a randomized control study to determine whether giving additional consolidation chemotherapy and DLI might decrease likelihood of second relapse in persons without chronic GvHD or with a positive MRD-test after initial post-relapse therapy with induction chemotherapy and DLI.

Number of participants with a positive results of minimal residual disease that is evaluated by testing aberrant leukemia-associated immune phenotypes and WT1 mRNA levels., Investigators use two strategies to test for minimal residual disease in bone marrow samples: (1) aberrant leukemia-associated immune phenotypes detected by 4 colour flow cytometry; and (2) WT1 mRNA levels detected by polymerase chain reaction., one year
Number of participants who relapsed, Relapse was defined as recurrence of ≥5% bone marrow blasts or of ≥1 extra-medullary sites of leukaemia., one year|Number of surviving participants, The outcomes of participants are recored until one year, one year
