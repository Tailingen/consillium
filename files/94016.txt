A Trial of Pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305) Plus Venetoclax and Rituximab (PVR) Versus Venetoclax and Rituximab (VR) in Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed duration pirtobruitinib (LOXO-305) with VR (Arm A) compared to VR alone (Arm B) in patients with CLL/SLL who have been previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy. Participation could last up to five years.
