Efficacy and Safety of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Oral Vinorelbine in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with oral vinorelbine, and immune maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, with a view to providing an effective treatment regimen for these patients.
Vinorelbine
DRUG: vinorelbine
Overall survival, The time between the start of treatment and death from any cause in the one-arm trial, 5 years|objective response rate, The ratio of complete response and partial response at 3 months after the end of radiotherapy, 3 months
Patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy are enrolled to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with oral vinorelbine, and immune-maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include disease control rate, progression-free survival, compliance and safety.
