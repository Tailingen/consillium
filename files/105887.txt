The Effect of a Stepped-care Metacognition-based Intervention on Managing Fear of Cancer Recurrence
A sequential multiple-assignment randomized controlled trial (SMART) will be used to assess the effect of an adaptive stepped-care intervention on FCR in cancer survivors with subclinical levels of fear of cancer recurrence.
Cancer|Fear of Cancer Recurrence
BEHAVIORAL: eConquerFear|BEHAVIORAL: eHealthMaintenance|BEHAVIORAL: ConquerFear|BEHAVIORAL: eConquerFear+eHealthMaintenance
Change of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), The primary outcome is the change in the total score of FCR assessed using the 42-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI). The FCRI measures seven dimensions of FCR: (1) triggers, (2) severity, (3) psychological distress, (4) functional impairment, (5) reassurance, (6) insights, and (7) coping strategies. All items are rated on 5-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (not at all or never) to 4 (a great deal or all the time). Higher scores indicate higher levels of FCR., baseline (T0), one-month post-intervention (T1), and six-month (T2) post intervention
Change of metacognitions, Metacognition assessed by the 30-item Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ). The MCQ assesses individual differences in metacognitive beliefs, judgements, and monitoring tendencies across five domains: (1) positive beliefs about worry, (2) negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger, (3) cognitive confidence, (4) cognitive self-consciousness, and (5) the need to control thoughts. All items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (do not agree) to 4 (agree very much). Higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive metacognition., baseline (T0), one-month post-intervention (T1), and six-month (T2) post intervention|Change of cognitive attentional syndrome, CAS measured by the 16-item Cognitive Attentional Syndrome-1 (CAS-1) questionnaire.The CAS-1 assesses the frequency of engaging in rumination, threat monitoring, and coping behaviors, as well as the level of metacognitive beliefs. Each item is rated on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 8, except for items measuring metacognitive beliefs, which are rated on a scale from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher levels of CAS activation., baseline (T0), one-month post-intervention (T1), and six-month (T2) post intervention
The current SMART trial aims to address the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: It is better to begin adaptive interventions with eConquerFear than with eHealthMaintenance.

Hypothesis 2: Among initial non-respondents, it is better to switch to supervised, face-to-face ConquerFear than to augment eConquerFear with eHealthMaintenance.

Hypothesis 3: eConquerFear + ConquerFear will lead to the greatest reduction in fear of cancer recurrence.

Hypothesis 4: There would be an indirect effect of stepped-care ConquerFear intervention on fear of cancer recurrence through its effect on maladaptive metacognition and cognitive attentional syndrome.
