Chiauranib in Combination With Chidamide in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The purpose of this dose-escalation study is to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with Chiauranib and Chidamide administered orally over a range of doses in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in the meantime, exploring the pharmacodynamic profile and latent biomarkers accompany with Chiauranib and Chidamide , as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.

The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests ,etc., of a range of doses of Chiauranib and Chidamide in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and to determine the dose limit toxicity and the maximum tolerable dose.

In the meantime, exploring the pharmacodynamic profile and latent biomarkers accompany with Chiauranib and Chidamide , as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.
