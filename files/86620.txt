Study to Investigate the Effect of Rifampin and Itraconazole on the Action of Pamiparib in Participants With Cancer
The study was an open-label, parallel-group, fixed-sequence study in male and female cancer patients. The study consists of 2 phases: the Core Phase, which is divided into Part A and Part B, and the Extension Phase. Part A investigated the effect of CYP3A induction by rifampin on the single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of pamiparib, and Part B investigated the effect of CYP3A inhibition by itraconazole on the single dose PK of pamiparib. Participants were offered participation in the Extension Phase, in which they received pamiparib until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or any other reason for discontinuation.
