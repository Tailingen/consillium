Ascending Doses of Ceralasertib in Combination With Chemotherapy and/or Novel Anti Cancer Agents
This is a modular, phase I/ phase 1 b, open-label, multicentre study of ceralasertib administered orally in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and/or novel anti-cancer agents, to patients with advanced malignancies. The study design allows an investigation of optimal combination dose of ceralasertib with other anti-cancer treatments, with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. The initial combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with carboplatin. The second combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with Olaparib. The third combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with durvalumab. The fourth module will investigate the effect of food on ceralasertib absorption and the effect of ceralasertib on ECG parameter. The fifth module to be investigated is ceralasertib with AZD5305.

This is a modular, phase I, two part, open-label, multicentre study of ceralasertib, administered orally, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and/or novel anti-cancer agents, to patients with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies. The study design allows an escalation of the dose of ceralasertib in combination with the standard dose and schedule of either cytotoxic chemotherapies and/or novel anti-cancer agents, with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. There are two parts to each combination module of this study; part A, dose escalation and an optional part B, cohort expansions in particular patient groups. The initial combination module will be with Carboplatin (module 1). The second combination will be with Olaparib (module 2). The third combination will be with durvalumab (module 3), the fourth combination will be AZD5305 (Module 5). The option to start further combination modules will be the decision of the Safety Review Committee (SRC), based on emerging preclinical data and, safety and tolerability information from the initial combination. Combinations of ceralasertib with novel anti-cancer agents may also be explored. Once a minimally biologically active dose of ceralasertib, for that combination module, has been identified from part A of that module, the SRC may decide to commence part B if deemed to be necessary. This may include cohort expansions of specific patient groups to explore preliminary anti-tumour activity or the effect of food or particular drug combinations on drug pharmacokinetics. The fourth module will investigate the effect of food on ceralasertib absorption and whether ceralasertib has an effect on QT.
