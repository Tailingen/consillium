Study of Oral PXD101 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
This is a Phase I dose escalation study of PXD101 administered orally. Oral belinostat will be given once or twice daily at various dosing schedules to patients with solid tumors. Doses will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. In parallel, a cohort of lymphoma patients will be given oral belinostat on a discontinuous once daily dosing schedule.
