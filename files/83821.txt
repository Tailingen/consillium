Exercise and Pain in CCS
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that integration of exercise intervention into standard post-cancer directed treatment care will improve patient reported pain, decrease the need for medications to manage chronic pain and improve functional and psychosocial outcomes in survivors of cancers in children and adolescents. Our central hypothesis is that integration of exercise interventions into standard post-cancer directed treatment care will be acceptable and feasible while improving patients' pain, decreasing the cumulative dose of pain medication and improving patients' functional and psychosocial outcomes as compared to patients who only receive standard post-cancer directed treatment care.
Childhood Cancer Survivors
BEHAVIORAL: Physical activity intervention coupled with standard post-cancer directed treatment care|OTHER: Standard post-cancer directed treatment care control
Acceptability of the intervention, The number of participants approached who agree to participate in the study, Baseline|Feasibility of the intervention, The number of participants randomized to the physical activity program intervention coupled with standard post-cancer directed treatment care who complete at least 50% of the physical activity intervention., Baseline to week 16
Measure changes in chronic pain levels, Self-reported chronic pain questionnaire using the PedsQL pediatric pain questionnaire. The parent proxy-report format is used to assess the parent's perceptions of their child's pain.

Range 0-100, Higher score indicates higher pain intensity, Baseline, week 8 and week 16|Measure changes in cumulative dose of pain medications, * Chart review: number of pain medications prescribed, total dosage and length of time prescribed.
* Self-reported pain medication: usage of prescription medication and information about the use of non-prescription pain medications (e.g., over the counter oral and topical pain medications).
* The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program will be accessed to gather information on all filled prescriptions for controlled substances within the state of Pennsylvania.
* Morphine equivalent dose will be calculated for each patient after looking at the total daily amount of each opioid the patient is taking. Using the standard conversion factors developed by the CDC, the Morphine milligram equivalent equates the many different opioids into a standard value that is based on morphine and its potency providing an easily interpretable metric for representing opioid utilization, Baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and week 16|Measure changes in patient reported outcomes, Psychosocial questionnaires using the NIH developed PROMIS pediatric questionnaires, which are validated for pediatric oncology, including: Self-reported physical function mobility, Anxiety, Depressive symptoms, Fatigue, Peer relationships, Social isolation, Pain interference, Pain intensity, Sleep disturbance, Cognitive function.

PROMIS pediatric questionnaires assessing PROs on 5 point Likert scale responses, Baseline, week 8 and week 16|Measure changes in physical activity level, Self-reported physical activity questionnaire using the Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire.

* Less than 14 units: Insufficiently active
* 14 to 23 units: Moderately active
* 24 units or more: Active, Baseline, week 8 and week 16|Measure changes in patient functional outcomes (6-min walking test), Validated physical function tests for pediatric patients, including the 6-min walking test Further distances indicate greater physical function, Baseline and week 16|Measure changes in patient functional outcomes (30-second chair stand test), Validated physical function tests for pediatric patients, including the 30-second chair stand test Greater amounts of sit/stands indicate greater physical function, Baseline and week 16|Measure changes in patient functional outcomes ("Timed Up and Go" test), Validated physical function tests for pediatric patients, including the "Timed Up and Go" test Shorter durations indicate greater physical function, Baseline and week 16|Measure changes in patient functional outcomes (grip strength test), Validated physical function tests for pediatric patients, including the grip strength test Greater grip strength indicate greater physical function, Baseline and week 16
