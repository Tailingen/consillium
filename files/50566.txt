A Study of JMT601 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory CD20-positive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety of JMT601 in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 studies (RP2D). Study consists of 2 parts. The first part is a dose-escalation part using a 3+3 design with up to 6 dose(0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, 12 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) escalation cohorts at increasing levels. The second part is a dose-expansion part at R2PD dose to assess preliminary efficacy of JMT601.
