The Anti-reflux Effect of Double-flap Technique in Laparoscopic Proximal Gastrectomy.
This study is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized parallel-controlled trial. The purpose is to explore whether the incidence rate of reflux esophagitis (RE) within 12 months after surgery is non-inferior for the DFT group compared to the DTR group.
Proximal Early Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: double-flap technique（DFT）; double-tract reconstruction(DTR),
Proportion of patients with reflux esophagitis, The percentage (%) of patients developing postoperative reflux esophagitis after surgery in the two group., Within 12 months after surgery
Postoperative complications, Evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification to assess the severity of postoperative complications., Within 12 months after surgery|Operation time, From the beginning of surgery to the end of surgery, Perioperative period|Kamikawa anastomosis time, The time of making the seromuscular flap and the time of esophagogastrostomy were included, Perioperative period|intraoperative blood loss, The operation begins to end the amount of bleeding., Perioperative period|Weight change, Calculated in kilograms, Within 12 months after surgery|Body Mass Index (BMI), weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2, Within 12 months after surgery|Albumin value, The concentration of albumin in the blood, expressed in g/L., Within 12 months after surgery|Pre albumin value, The concentration of pre albumin in the blood, expressed in g/L., Within 12 months after surgery|Hemoglobin value, The concentration of Hemoglobin in the blood, expressed in g/L., Within 12 months after surgery|Folic acid value, The concentration of Folic acid value in the blood, expressed in ng/mL., Within 12 months after surgery|Vitamin B12 value, The concentration of Vitamin B12 value in the blood, expressed in uug/L., Within 12 months after surgery|Ferritin value, The concentration of Vitamin B12 value in the blood, expressed in ug/L., Within 12 months after surgery|Nutritional risk screening 2002, The nutritional status is assessed using the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) scale, with a scoring range of 0 to 7 points. A higher score indicates a worse nutritional status., Within 12 months after surgery
This study will enroll patients with proximal gastric cancer scheduled to undergo laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will undergo laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-flap technique (DFT) anastomosis, while the other group will undergo laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (DTR). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who develop reflux esophagitis within 12 months after surgery. The secondary endpoints include postoperative complications, surgery-related indicators, and postoperative nutritional status.
