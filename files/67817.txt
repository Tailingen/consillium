A Study of SI-B001, an EGFR/HER3 Bispecific Antibody, in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Epithelial Tumors
In phase Ia study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epithelial malignancies will be investigated to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SI-B001.

In the phase Ib study, the safety and tolerability of SI-B001 at the phase Ia recommended dose will be further investigated, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for phase II clinical studies will be determined.

In addition, the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and immunogenicity of SI-B001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epithelial tumors will be evaluated.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Epithelial Tumor
DRUG: SI-B001
Phase Ia: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLTs are assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 during the first cycle (28 days) and defined as occurrence of any of the toxicities in DLT definition if judged by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug administration., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|Phase Ia: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 in 6 participants experienced a DLT during the first cycle (within 28 days of the first administration)., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of SI-B001., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of SI-B001. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of SI-B001., Up to approximately 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of SI-B001 will be investigated., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of SI-B001 will be investigated., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of SI-B001 will be investigated., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|AUC0-t, AUC0-t is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|CL (Clearance), CL in the serum of SI-B001 per unit of time will be investigated., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|Ctrough, Ctough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of SI-B001 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to 28 days after the first dose of SI-B001|ADA (anti-drug antibody), Incidence and titer of ADA of SI-B001 will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months|Nab (neutralizing antibody), Incidence and titer of Nab of SI-B001 will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of SI-B001 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival, The OS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of SI-B001 to the time of death from any cause, Up to approximately 24 months
