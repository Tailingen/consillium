Intraoperative Frozen Section Pathology to Guide Surgical Treatment for Lung Adenocarcinoma (ECTOP-1016)
This study is one of Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Projects (ECTOP-1016). The goal of this clinical trial is to confirm the concordance rate between intra-operative frozen section pathological diagnosis and post-operative paraffin embedded pathological diagnosis, and use this result to guide surgical treatment for early stage (cT1N0M0) lung adenocarcinomas.
