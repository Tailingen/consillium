Alpha Radiation Emitters Device (DaRT) for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
A unique approach for cancer treatment including radioactive sources named Alpha DaRT sources: Ra - 224 coated onto stainless steel tubes inserted into the tumor for the treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer .
Pancreatic Cancer|Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: Radiation: Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters Therapy (DaRT)
Safety - Serious adverse events, Safety will be determined according to the overall incidence of device related SAEs with severity graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, from Day 0 , up to 12 months
Efficacy - tumor response, to evaluate the efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with respect according to Objective tumor response rate according to RECIST 1.1, Day 0 , up to 12 months|Efficacy - overall survival, to evaluate the efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with respect according to Overall survival, Day 0 , up to 12 months|Efficacy - Progression-free survival, to evaluate the efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with respect according to - Progression-free survival, Day 0 , up to 12 months|Efficacy - Percentage of R0/R1 resected patients, to evaluate the efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with respect according to Percentage of R0/R1 resected patients, Day 0 , up to 12 months|Efficacy - percentage of patients with tumors that became surgically respectable after DaRT treatment, to evaluate the efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in advanced pancreatic cancer patients with respect according to percentage of patients with tumors that became surgically respectable after DaRT treatment, Day 0 , up to 12 months
This study will be a prospective, interventional, open label, single arm, multiple center study.

Patients who have been previously treated with 8 - 12 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX will undergo DaRT insertion, with the goal of making their tumor resectable. Three (3) days after DaRT insertion, patients will begin taking Capecitabine for 2 months. Every 2 months after DaRT insertion, the patient will be assessed to determine if their tumor is surgically resectable, if they should continue with therapy, or if they should pause therapy. The trial will end 12 months after DaRT insertion.
