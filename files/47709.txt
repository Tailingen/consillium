King's Invasive Aspergillosis Study II
Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy or transplantation.

This current study aims to assess the impact of prophylactically using the broad-spectrum anti-fungal agent posaconazole on the incidence of IFD in high risk patients with aplastic anaemia and those undergoing intensive chemotherapy, for example for acute myeloid leukaemia, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
