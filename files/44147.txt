Phase I Study of BAY1436032 in IDH1-mutant Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is:

- Determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of BAY 1436032 in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-R132X-mutant advanced solid tumors.

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY1436032 in patients with IDH1-R132X-mutant advanced solid tumors.
* Evaluate the effect of a standard high-fat, high calorie meal on the PK of BAY1436032.
* Assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and evidence of clinical efficacy associated with BAY1436032 administration in patients with IDH1-R132X-mutant advanced solid tumors.
