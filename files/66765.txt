Instanyl® Non-Interventional Study
The aim of this study is to describe the use of Instanyl® (Intranasal fentanyl spray) in the treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in cancer patients by success of dose titration and distribution of dose strength. Data will be collected at three different time points over a 3 month period.
