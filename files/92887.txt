A Study of [225Ac]-FPI-1966 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumours
This first-in-human study evaluates safety, tolerability and distribution of \[225Ac\] FPI-1966, \[111In\]-FPI-1967, and vofatamab in patients with FGFR3-expressing solid tumors.

Phase 1: Phase 1: Incidence of AEs to evaluate safety and tolerability of [225Ac]-FPI-1966, [111In]-FPI-1967, and vofatamab., Approximately 2 years post final administration|Phase 1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of [225Ac]-FPI-1966, Approximately 42 days post administration.|Phase 1: Radiation dose of [111In]-FPI-1967 and [225Ac]-FPI-1966 (whole body, organs, and selected regions of interest), Within one week of administration|Phase 1: Effect of pre-dose administration of vofatamab on the radiation dosimetry of [111In]-FPI-1967 and [225Ac]-FPI-1966., Within one week of administration|Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR) (sum of complete and partial response) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to two years post final administration.
Phase 1 and 2: Anti-tumour activity of [225Ac]-FPI-1966 regimen measured by response per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years post final administration|Phase 1 and 2: Tumour uptake of [111In]-FPI-1967 by evaluating SPECT/CT and/or planar images, Within one week of administration|Phase 2: Radiation dose of [111In]-FPI-1967 and [225Ac]-FPI-1966 (whole body, organs, and selected regions of interest), Within one week of administration|Phase 1 and 2: Clearance for radioactivity and for the targeting antibody., 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966administration|Phase 1 and 2: Area under the curve (AUC) for radioactivity and targeting antibody, 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966administration.|Phase 1 and 2: Maximum concentration after dosing (Cmax) for radioactivity and targeting antibody., 28 days post final[225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration|Phase 1 and 2: Half-life for radioactivity and targeting antibody., 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration|Phase 1: Changes in clearance for radioactivity and targeting antibody following pre-dose administration of vofatamab, 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration|Phase 1: Changes in AUC for radioactivity and targeting antibody following pre-dose administration of vofatamab., 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration|Phase 1: Changes in Cmax for radioactivity and targeting antibody following pre-dose administration of vofatamab., 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration|Phase 1: Changes in half-life for radioactivity and targeting antibody following pre-dose administration of vofatamab, 28 days post final [225Ac]-FPI-1966 administration
In phase 1, cohort 1, the potential impact of pre-dose administration of vofatamab on the dosimetry, PK, safety, and tolerability of \[225Ac\]-FPI-1966 and \[111In\]-FPI-1967 will be evaluated.

In later phase 1 cohorts, \[225Ac\]-FPI-1966 will be evaluated at ascending dose levels. Participants will receive \[111In\]-FPI-1967 during the imaging screening period to assess FGFR3 expression and to determine biodistribution and estimate radiation exposure to critical organs.

Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or regimen is established and confirmed, three tumour-agnostic expansion cohorts may be initiated in parallel.
