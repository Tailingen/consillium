A Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics Study of AMG 794 With Claudin 6-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, and Other Malignant Solid Tumor Indications
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 794 in adult participants and to determine the optimal biological active dose (OBD), at or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with MTD 1 as the maximum tolerated starting dose and MTD 2 as the maximum tolerated target dose.
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Claudin 6-positive Advanced/Metastatic Malignant Solid Tumors
DRUG: AMG 794
Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Day 1 to Day 28|Number of Participants Who Experience a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs are any event that occurs after the participant has received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests that occur after study treatment administration will be recorded as TEAEs., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Number of Participants Who Experience a Treatment-related AE, Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years
Minimum Efficacious Dose (MED), Defined as the first unconfirmed partial response (PR) or better., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of AMG 794, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 6 Day 1 (28 day cycle length)|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) of AMG 794, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 6 Day 1 (28 day cycle length)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) Over the Dosing Interval of AMG 794, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 6 Day 1 (28 day cycle length)|Confirmed objective response (OR), Defined as best overall response \[BOR\] of complete response \[CR\] or PR based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Confirmed OR, Defined as immune BOR (iBOR) of immune CR (iCR) or immune PR (iPR) based on Immune RECIST (iRECIST)., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 Response, CA 125 response will be analyzed in the Ovarian Cancer Analysis Set, defined as all participants with a primary tumor type of ovarian cancer who are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of AMG 794., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Duration of Response, Defined as the time from the first documentation of OR until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Time to Progression, Defined as the time from enrollment until the first documentation of radiological disease progression., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from enrollment until the first documentation of radiologic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Day 1 to a maximum of 2 years|1-year Overall Survival (OS), 1 year|2-year OS, 2 years
