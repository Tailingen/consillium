PD-L2 Targeting Nanobody Radiotracer for PET Imaging of Solid Tumor
The objective of this study is to construct a noninvasive approach using 68Ga- Mirc415 PET/CT to detect the PD-L2 expression of tumor lesion in patients with colorectal cancer, lung cancer and other solid tumor to identify patients benefiting from anti-PD-(L)1 treatment.
