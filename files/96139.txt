Pembrolizumab and Exemestane/ Leuprolide in Premenopausal HR+/ HER2- Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, pilot study of pembrolizumab, exemestane, and leuprolide for subjects being resistant for front-line hormonal therapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic hormonal receptor positive (HR+)/ Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. All the patients will be included in the final tolerability and preliminary efficacy analysis. The efficacy objectives including PFS, overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of response (DOR). Adverse effects will be recorded according to CTCAE v4.0.
Premenopausal Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab/ Exemestane/ Leuprolide
The PFS rate at 8 months, To estimate the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and exemestane/ leuprolide in premenopausal with hormone receptor positive/ HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients, as defined by PFS rate at 8 months., 28 months
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 28 months|The PFS based on RECIST 1.1, 28 months|The overall response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1, 28 months|The clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on RECIST 1.1, 28 months|The duration of overall response (DOR) based on RECIST 1.1, 28 months
The correlation of potential predictive markers with the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and exemestane/ leuprolide, The predictive markers including:

* PD-L1 expression in primary and metastatic tumors, as well as in circulating tumor cells
* tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in primary and metastatic tumors
* mutational load and neoantigens in metastatic tumors
* change in cancer immune response profile between primary and metastatic tumors
* luminal type change by PAM50 in primary and metastatic tumors, 28 months
