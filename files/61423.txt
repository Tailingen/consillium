Elimination of Minimal Residual Disease After Transplant
This is a single-center, single-arm, phase II study that will enroll multiple myeloma (MM) patients with persistent bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) post autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Isatuximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
The number of subjects who have less than MRD., Bone marrow MRD negative at a cutoff sensitivity of ≤1x10\^5 sequence copies as measured by the clonoSEQ® next-generation sequencing assay at the end of IsaRd treatment., One year
Thirty-one study subjects will be enrolled at Froedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center. Enrolled subjects will receive a combination of isatuximab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IsaRD) for 12 28-day cycles. The primary objective of this study is to determine bone marrow (BM) MRD ≤1x10\^5 negativity rate, as measured by the clonoSEQ® next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, at the end of 12 months of IsaRD treatment. Other objectives will further assess efficacy, tolerability, and molecular response to the IsaRD regimen.
