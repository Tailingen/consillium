ORR, The Objective Response Rate(ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1., 1 year
mORR, The mRECIST Objective Response Rate(mORR) is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by mRECIST., 1 year|DOR, The During Of Response(DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or death (whichever occurs first)., 1 year|DCR, The Disease Control Rate(DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1 ., 1 year|conversion rate, unresectable converted into resectable, 1 year|PFS, The progression-free survival time (PFS) defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or death, whichever comes earlier., 1 year|OS, Overall survival(OS) is measured from the start date of the Treatment Phase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause.

The combination of anti-angiogenesis and immune checkpoint blockade showed promising outcomes for advanced HCC. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy （HAIC） combined with apatinib and camrelizumab could augment treatment efficacy in preliminary study. But HAIC had disadvantages such as technical limitations, expensive cost and poor patient comfort. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Venous Infusion Chemotherapy（VIC） plus camrelizumab and apatinib for CNLC stage Ⅲ HCC.
