A Phase II Trial of Preoperative Proton Therapy in Soft-tissue Sarcomas of the Extremities and Body Wall
When treated with surgery alone, many soft-tissue sarcomas have a high chance of coming back. Radiation therapy is frequently used in addition to surgery to reduce the chances of the sarcoma coming back. However, radiation can have long-term side effects on the normal tissues surrounding the tumor, leading to problems such as swelling, scarring, and joint stiffness.

Recently, there have been advances in the way that radiation therapy can be given. Proton radiation therapy is one of those advances. With proton radiation, it is possible to give radiation over a smaller area surrounding the tumor, resulting in less radiation to the surrounding normal tissues.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether proton radiation decreases the long-term side effects of radiation on normal tissues and if smaller proton radiation fields reduce local recurrence compared to the larger radiation fields that have been used in prior studies.

RADIATION: proton radiation|PROCEDURE: surgery (wide local excision; limb preservation surgery)
Late Radiation Toxicities at 2 Years From the Start of Radiation Treatment, To report the number of participants with late radiation morbidity

Late subcutaneous fibrosis and joint stiffness are assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (EORTC/RTOG) late toxicity scoring criteria below:

Subcutaneous tissue: Grade 1(slight fibrosis; subcutaneous fat loss), Grade 2(moderate fibrosis: slight field contracture), Grade 3(severe fibrosis; field contracture \>10%), Grade 4(necrosis), Grade 0 (none) Joint stiffness: Grade 1(mild stiffness; slight range of motion loss), Grade 2(Moderate stiffness, pain, range of motion loss), Grade 3(Severe stiffness, pain, range of motion loss), Grade 4(necrosis; complete fixation), Grade 0 (none) Lymphedema is measured according to the criteria of Stern: Score 0(none), Score 1(Mild but definite swelling), Score 2(Moderate), Score 3(Severe, considerable swelling), Grade 4(Very severe (skin shiny \& tight), at 2 years from the start of radiation treatment

Data support preoperative radiotherapy as one of the standard options in the management of large or high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS). The advantages of preoperative radiotherapy are lower doses and smaller radiation volumes; these may be used to effect improvement of long-term side effects and extremity function. Another potential advantage is assisting surgery through tumor shrinkage and reduction of tumor cell seeding. The disadvantage of preoperative radiation is the higher likelihood of postoperative wound complications, but in a prospective phase III trial these complications were found to be generally temporary and without significant effect on long term function.

Combined conservative surgery and radiotherapy has shown to achieve excellent local control in sarcoma patients following margin-negative surgery, but late radiation morbidity and reduced quality of life may result from adjuvant radiation. The dosimetric advantage of proton radiotherapy may translate into reduced acute and late effects due to improved normal-tissue sparing in the treatment of extremity and truncal STS. However, these potential advantages need to be validated in clinical trials. The investigators propose a phase II study to evaluate the effect of preoperative proton radiotherapy on the reduction of late radiation morbidity, patterns of failure, and impact of late radiation morbidity on general quality of life (QOL).
