Palliative Care Intervention in Improving Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Communication in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Treatment
This pilot randomized clinical trial studies palliative care intervention in improving quality of life, psychological distress, and communication in patients with solid tumors receiving treatment on phase I trials. Cancer patients experience many symptoms related to treatment and the cancer itself that can be distressing and impact quality of life. Palliative care focuses on managing these symptoms and may help patients with solid tumors live more comfortably.

Change in overall QOL scores, assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spirituality (FACIT-Sp), To control for inflation of experimentwise error caused by analyzing four different QOL subscales, alpha will be set to .01. A 2x2 multiply repeated measures ANCOVA (in which the within groups variables are QOL subscale scores at 4 and 12 weeks, the between groups measure is treatment group (control vs. PCI), and the covariate is baseline QOL) might be employed if the correlation between the four FACT-G subscale scores are high enough to warrant such an analysis. The overall QOL score derived from the FACT-G will be tested individually using alpha=.05.

If subscale correlations are not high, outcome will be analyzed using four 2x2 repeated measures ANCOVAs in which the within groups variable is each QOL subscale, the between groups measure is group (PCI vs. control), and the covariate is the appropriate baseline QOL subscale (Physical well-being, emotional well-being, social well-being, and functional well-being)., Baseline to 12 weeks|Change in psychological distress, assessed using the Psychological Distress Thermometer, Analyzed using a 2x2 repeated measures ANCOVA to test for differences in psychological distress (Psychological Distress Thermometer scores), at 4 and 12-week between the PCI and control groups, controlling for baseline psychological distress., Baseline to 12 weeks|Satisfaction with communication, measured by the Family Satisfaction with Advanced Cancer Care (FAMCARE), Analyzed using a 2x2 repeated measures ANCOVA to test for differences in satisfaction (Family Satisfaction with Advanced Cancer Care scores), at 4 and 12-week between the PCI and control groups, controlling for baseline satisfaction., 12 weeks|Patients' symptom intensity and symptom interference with daily activities, Analyzed using a 2x2 repeated measures ANCOVA to test for differences in symptom intensity and symptom interference with daily activities (using Psychological Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO - CTCAE) scores), at 4 and 12-week between the PCI and control groups, controlling for baseline symptom intensity and symptom interference., 12 weeks|Total numbers of supportive care referrals (social work, dietitian, chaplaincy, psychologist/psychiatrist), Contingency table analysis and the chi square statistic will be used to examine the association between group and referral to various support services.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Test the effects of a palliative care intervention (PCI) on patients' quality of life (QOL), psychological distress and satisfaction with communication, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

II. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' symptom intensity and symptom interference with daily activities, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

III. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' hospital and palliative care resource utilization and clinical trial retention rates, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

IV. Test the effects of the timing of PCI initiation (early versus delayed) on patient outcomes, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

V. Describe patients' satisfaction with the PCI.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive part I of the PCI comprising quantitative surveys, comprehensive palliative care assessment by the Research Nurses, and goals of care discussions beginning prior to administration of the first dose of phase I treatment. Patients then receive part II of the PCI comprising recommendations from the interdisciplinary team, patient educational sessions, and supportive care referrals following the first dose of phase I treatment and is completed within one month of the first treatment.

ARM II: Patients receive usual care until 12 weeks post-treatment initiation. Patients then receive both part I and II of the PCI.

After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.
