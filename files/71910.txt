ICARuS Post-operative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (EPIC) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) After Optimal Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) for Neoplasms of the Appendix, Colon or Rectum With Isolated Peritoneal Metastasis
This is the first randomized trial comparing Early post-operative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for appendiceal and colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, EPIC and HIPEC after cytoreductive surgery have on the patient and the appendiceal, rectal or colon cancer.
