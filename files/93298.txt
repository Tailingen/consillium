A Trial of SHR-1210 in Combination With SHR6390 in Patients With Advanced CRC, NSCLC and HCC
This is a Phase Ib/II , Open-label , Investigator-initiated Trail of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in Combination With SHR6390 (a CDK4/6 Inhibitor) in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

The study was designed in two stages, the first stage was the tolerance observation stage, and the second stage was the curative effect expansion stage.

The first part of the study is the Dose-finding Phase designed to establish the safety of SHR-1210 Combination With SHR6390 at different dose Levels(150mg QD or 100mg QD ). The second part of the study is the Expansion Phase designed to generate additional clinical data at specified doses .

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 combination with SHR6390 in the treatment of advanced CRC,NSCLC and HCC.
