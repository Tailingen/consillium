Study of Dacomitinib and Osimertinib for Patients With Advanced EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of dacomitinib and osimertinib, at increasing doses, to find out what effects, if any, this combination of drugs has on people with metastatic EGFR mutant lung cancer that has not been treated with an EGFR TKI.
