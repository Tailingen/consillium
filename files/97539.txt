Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of a Thorium-227 Labeled Antibody-chelator Conjugate Alone and in Combination With Darolutamide, in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The study medication (BAY 2315497 Injection) is a thorium-227 labeled immuno-conjugate, specific for the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which will be evaluated in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study, this investigational medication will be administered to patients for the first time. The primary objective of the study is to define the safety and tolerability profile and Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BAY2315497 Injection alone, or in combination with darolutamide. The secondary objectives are to determine the recommended dose for further clinical development of BAY2315497 Injection alone, or in combination with darolutamide and to investigate how the study drug is distributed and cleared from the body.
