Durvalumab(MEDI4736) After chemoRadioTherapy(DART) for NSCLC-a Translational and Biomarker Study
The main aim is to identify and describe biomarkers in different sample types related to chemoradiation followed by durvalumab treatment for stage III PD-L1 negative and positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients' eligible for curatively intended chemoradiation.

The hypothesis is that clinical differences in course of disease reflect underlying biological characteristics.

Impact of tumour mutational burden (TMB) measured in the tumour tissue and blood samples, on the hazard., Analyses of TMB in tumour tissue. Patients with high Tumour Mutational Burden, TMB (\> 8.5 mutations per megabase) have a hazard ratio equal to or less than 0.55 as compared to patients with low TMB. Tumor tissue will be analysed in regard to TMB, and several different cut-offs will be evaluated., Throughout study, up to 5 years
Predict assosiation between Tumour Mutational Burden, TMB, measured in tumour tissue and blood samples and clinical response, To investigate different levels of TMB in tumor tissue compared to blood samples, as predictors for development of clinical response, Through study, up to 5 years|Specific RNA profiles predict response to treatment, Transcriptome characterization (RNA-sequencing) on tumour material to investigate this, Through study, up to 5 years|Impact of Molecular profiles in urine on response to treatment, To investigate urine for predictive biomarkers (ctDNA, miRNA), Through study, up to 5 years|Analysis of pre-treatment and under-treatment samples may identify biomarkers for predicting which patients will benefit from treatment with durvalumab after chemoradiation, Analyses of biomarkers in tumour tissue., Through study, up to 5 years|The durvalumab treatment following chemoradiation will induce T cell responses against antigens expressed in each patientÂ´s tumor., Immunological response assessment performed on tumour material from participants., Through study, up to 5 years|A possible change in PD-L1 status will be explored, Immunohistochemistry of PD-L1 assessed on tumour tissue., Through study, up to 5 years|The durvalumab treatment following chemoradiation has acceptable safety and tolerability in NSCLC patients, as assessed by Patient Reported Outcome measurements., Patient reported outcome measurements by standardized Tools; EORTC-QLQ-C30 and LC13., Through study, up to 5 years
The gut microbiome influence the responses to chemoradiation followed by durvalumab, Genetic analyses on feces samples, by use of feces "Cards"., Through study, up to 5 years
This is an open, multinational, phase 2 trial to investigate the Properties of cancer cells before, during and after treatment with the investigational study drug durvalumab in patients with locally advanced non-small celled lung cancer (NSCLC). Both patients with high and low PD-L1 expression are allowed to participate. Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) will be administered after a period with standardtreatment with chemotherapy and radiationtherapy (chemoradiotherapy) for around 7 weeks. After maximum 5 weeks break after chemoradiotherapy, durvalumab will be given in the same dose to all patients for up to 12 months. The follow-up include a safety follow-up for up to five years, followed by a survival follow-up for up to a total of ten years.

The main aim is to identify and describe biomarkers in different sample types related to chemoradiation followed by durvalumab treatment for stage III PD-L1 negative and positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients' eligible for curatively intended chemoradiation.
