A Trial of Y101D in Combination With Gemcitabine and Albumin Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The Phase Ib/II study is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Y101D in combination with Gemcitabine and Albumin Paclitaxel as first-line systemic treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study aims to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of Y101D in combination with the standard regimen of Gemcitabine and Albumin Paclitaxel and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The Phase II portion of the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this combination treatment in a small population of patients.
Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose limiting toxicities during the first 21 days after the first administrations of Y101D in each cohort., From the time of the first dose (Day 1) until Day 21|RP2D, Recommended Phase 2 Dose of Y101D, From the enrollment of first patient through phae 1b study completion, an average of 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate assessed according to RECIST 1.1 per investigator, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression (up to 6 months)
Peak Serum Concentration (Cmax), The highest Y101D concentration in serum during one treatment cycle (21 days), From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|Trough Serum Concentration (Ctrough), The lowest Y101D concentration in serum during one treatment cycle (21 days), From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) during one treatment cycle (21 days), The area under the serum concentration versus tiem curve of Y101D during one treatment cycle (21 days), From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|The TGF-β concentration in serum, The TGF-β concentreation in serum at 30 minutes before the first treatment dosing of Y101D and the subsequent dosing of Y101D every two cycles (Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, etc.) until the disease progression or death or toxicity intolerance of Y101D., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or death or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|The CA19-9 concentration in serum, The CA19-9 concentreation in serum at 30 minutes before the first treatment dosing of Y101D and the subsequent dosing of Y101D every two cycles (Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, etc.) until the disease progression or death or toxicity intolerance of Y101D., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or death or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|The positive rate of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) and Neutralizing antibody (Nab), The potivie rate of Anti-Drug Antibody and neutralizing antibody in serum 30 minutes before the Y101D infusion at Day 1 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and Cycle 7 (a 21-day cycle)., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months)|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate assessed according to RECIST 1.1 per investigator, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the first objective response to disease progression or death, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until one month after the EOT|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the first objective response to disease progression or death (Up to 12 months), From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or death (up to 12 months).|Overall survival (OS), The time from the first objective response to death (Up to 2 yrs), From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until death (up to 2 years).
A total of 57-81 systemic treatment-naïve patients with advanced pancreatic cancer will be enrolled in the study. Phase Ib will enroll 12-36 patients to assess the safety of Y101D combined with Gemcitabine and Albumin Paclitaxel at doses of 20mg/kg or 30mg/kg. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Y101D in combination with the other drugs will be determined based on the safety profile and preliminary efficacy data.

Following determination of the RP2D, Phase II will enroll a total of 40-45 patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination treatment using the RP2D of Y101D. The primary endpoint of the Phase II study will be the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints will include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR) and safety profiles. Pharmacodynamic parameters such as serum tumor biomarkers and TGF-β concentration will also be evaluated.

Overall, the study aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of Y101D in combination with Gemcitabine and Albumin Paclitaxel as a first-line systemic treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer patients.
