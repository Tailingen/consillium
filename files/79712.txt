SHR-1210 in Combination With Apatinib and Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer
Patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are recruited to this prospective non-randomized study comprising two separate cohorts. Patients will receive SHR-1210, a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, with apatinib and either irinotecan or paclitaxel liposome plus nedaplatin. The primary endpoint is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients in both cohorts. The regimen(s) of promising efficacy will be further verified in subsequent randomized studies to define the optimal combination of immunotherapy, anti-angiogenesis and chemotherapy in advanced esophageal cancer patients.
