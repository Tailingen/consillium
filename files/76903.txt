A Phase II Study of Gemcitabine and Erlotinib As Adjuvant Therapy In Patients With Resected Pancreatic Cancer
Study Hypothesis: To estimate time to recurrence in pancreatic cancer patients treated with adjuvant erlotinib and gemcitabine. Combination therapy will be given for 4 months followed by single agent erlotinib for a total of 12 months.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Erlotinib
Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), The time interval between day 1, cycle 1, of adjuvant treatment to the first date of radiologic recurrence or death., Up to 60 months|1-year Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), Up to 60 months|2-year Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), Up to 60 months
Estimated 1&2 Year Overall Survival (OS), Time from from date of first study therapy to to death from any cause., Up to 60 months|Percentage of Participants With Expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Percentage of participants with expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in the resected tumors was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)., Up to 60 months|KRAS Mutational Status, KRAS mutation status in resected tumor specimens., Up to 60 months
PATIENT POPULATION Resected pancreatic cancer patients (R0 resection) within 10 weeks of surgery will be eligible, provided that they meet standard eligibility criteria.

STUDY DESIGN Phase II, open-label trial of erlotinib and gemcitabine. SAFETY PLAN Safety as assessed by CTCAE 3.0 STUDY TREATMENT Erlotinib 150 mg/day x 12 months. (oral) Gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2 IV over 150 minutes q 2 weeks x 4 months Patients will be monitored with serial CT scans for the first 2 years after completion of therapy.

Clinical Practice: Therapy will be administered as an outpatient. Primary Evaluations: Time to recurrence CONCOMITANT THERAPY AND CLINICAL PRACTICE No other anti-cancer therapy will be allowed while on study.
