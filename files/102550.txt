A Study of Decreasing Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in People With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the treatment approach of de-escalated radiation and chemotherapy followed by a planned neck dissection surgery in people with head and neck cancer. The study will look at how effective the treatment approach is against participants' cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan|RADIATION: Chemoradiation therapy|DRUG: Carboplatin
Number of participants alive post-Chemo Radiation Therapy, The primary objective is to assess the pilot efficacy of RT dose de-escalation to grossly involved lymph nodes for hypoxia negative T0-T3N1-2B HPV- OPC/UPC and HPC/LXC patients. For evaluation on the efficacy of the regimen in this cohort, a simple decision rule will be implemented as follows: If, among the first 10 evaluable patients, we have at least 8 patients who are alive, followed, and have major pathological response on planned neck dissection at 4 months Â± 1 month post-CRT, then we will declare the treatment modality using that RT dose has pilot efficacy and will then proceed with treatment at the next de-escalated dose level., 2.5 years
