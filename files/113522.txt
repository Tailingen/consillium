Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Surgery for Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The prognosis of small liver cancer (â‰¤5 cm) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is encouraging, the 1-year local control rate has been reported to be 95-100%, 3-year local control rate about 91%, and 3-year overall survival rate around 70%. So far, there is no randomized controlled study comparing SBRT and surgical treatment for early-stage liver cancer. It is hoped that this study will further compare the efficacy of SBRT and surgery for early stage liver cancer.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatectomy|Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic hepatectomy (surgery)|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiotherapy
Progression free survival, The duration (months) between the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of first progression, From the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of first progression (local or distant), assessed up to 3 years
Local recurrence free survival, The duration (months) between the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of local recurrence, From the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of local recurrence, assessed up to 3 years|Overall survival, The duration (months) between the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of death., From the date of surgery or the first fraction of SBRT until the date of death, assessed up to 3 years
Early stage liver cancer, according to Milan criteria, are chose for this study. The patients are divided into two groups randomly. Patients in group A receive laparoscopic hepatectomy, group B patients receive SBRT.The 3-year progression free survival, 3-year local recurrence free survival, 3- year overall survival and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess whether SBRT is non-inferior to surgery.
