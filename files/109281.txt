Study of CG0070 Combined With Nivolumab in Cisplatin Ineligible Patients With MIBC
Investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination neoadjuvant therapy using intravesical CG0070 and IV Nivolumab in cisplatin ineligible patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC).
Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma|Bladder Cancer
DRUG: CG0070|DRUG: Nivolumab
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events Grade 3 or higher will be graded according to the NC Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, Up to 24 months after start of treatment
Change in PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells, The change in PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells from pre-treatment TURBT to post- treatment cystectomy samples will be assessed and analyzed using McNemar test for the change in the percentage of PD-L1 positivity before and after the study treatment, using the Stuart-Maxwell test with 4 ordered categories., Up to 24 months after start of treatment
Changes in intraepithelial CD8+ T cell density, The changes in intraepithelial CD8+ T cell density from pre-treatment TURBT to post-treatment cystectomy samples will be assessed using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test according to the distribution of changes in the CD8+T cell density. The distribution of changes will be investigated using the Anderson-Darling test., Up to 24 months after start of treatment
