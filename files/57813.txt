The effect on far infrared treatment on different kinds of cancer., 1 year
The investigators have identified a combination of methods for possible cancer treatment as follows:

1. Energy specific far infrared radiation (5 μm to 20 μm ). No x-rays, gamma rays etc. are used.
2. Oxygenation of the body cells
3. pH balance
4. Lifestyle changes, or
