NPWT in Patients Undergoing Surgical Procedures for Management of GI Malignancies
This randomized trial will use a Negative Pressure Wound Therapy device or standard wound closure, in participants with gastrointestinal neoplasms, to measure the rate of surgical site infections
Surgical Wound Infection
DEVICE: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy
Surgical Site Infection - Superficial Incisional, Investigators will measure rate of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) of participants who received Superficial Incisions., 30 days post operation|Surgical Site Infection - Deep Incisional, Investigators will measure rate of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) of participants who received Deep Incisions., 30 days post operation|Surgical Site Infection - Organ/Space Incisional, Investigators will measure rate of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) of participants who received Organ/Space Incisions., 30 days post operation
Return to Intended Oncologic Therapy (RIOT), Investigators will measure number of participants who returned to their intended oncologic therapy, Up to 12 months after surgery|Time to Initiation of Planned Oncologic Therapy, Investigators will measure time to initiation planned therapy from the surgery date to initiation date of planned oncologic therapy, Up to 12 months after surgery
