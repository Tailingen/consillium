Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (KTE-X19) in People With Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of brexucabtagene autoleucel (KTE-X19) in adults with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (r/r CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (r/r SLL) who have received at least 2 prior lines of treatment, one of which must include a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

After the end of KTE-C19-108, participants who received an infusion of brexucabtagene autoleucel will complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments in a separate Long-term Follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968 (NCT05041309).
Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Relapsed/Refractory Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: brexucabtagene autoleucel|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs refer to toxicities with onset experienced during the first 28 days of study treatment that have been judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment. DLTs evaluated may include with some exceptions: All brexucabtagene autoleucel related Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities lasting for more than 7 days, Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities regardless of duration, and Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting more than 30 days if not attributable to underlying disease., First infusion date of brexucabtagene autoleucel up to 28 days. Participants were evaluated in specified period but Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (specified in description) having onset in this period were further observed for 30 days for confirmation.
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Investigator Review Assessed by International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) 2018 Criteria, ORR was defined as percentage of participants achieving either complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete hematopoetic recovery (CRi) or partial response (PR). Criteria for CR: no lymphadenopathy \>1.5 cm or hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, lymphocytes \<4000/microliters (μL), bone marrow sample must be normocellular with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules, platelets ≥100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥11 grams per deciliter (g/dL). CRi: All CR criteria were met except with platelet count \<100,000/μL, hemoglobin \<11 g/dL or neutrophil count \<500/μL. PR: ≥1 of these: ≥50% decrease in lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, size of liver and spleen, 50% decrease in bone marrow infiltrates; and ≥1 of these: platelets ≥100,000/µL or ≥50% increase from Baseline, hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL or ≥50% increase from Baseline. Participants who did not meet criteria were considered nonresponders. 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by Clopper-Pearson method., First infusion date up to last follow up visit (maximum duration: 42 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant that does not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. TEAEs were defined as AEs with onset on or after the initiation of brexucabtagene autoleucel infusion., First infusion date up to last follow up visit (maximum duration: 42 months)|Peak Level of Anti-CD19 CAR T-Cells in Blood, Peak was defined as the maximum number of CAR T cells measured post-infusion., First infusion date up to 3 months post-infusion (approximately 3 months)
