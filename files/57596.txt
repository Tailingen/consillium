Cisplatin/Irinotecan With Concurrent Radiation for Inoperable NSCLC
This is a prospective, single institution phase II study, whose primary objective is to estimate the median and three year survival rate of non-small lung cancer patients with Stage IIIA and IIIB intra-thoracic disease which is referred to as "locally advanced" non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Lung Neoplasms, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Cisplatin
Estimate the median and three year survival rate of locally advanced NSCLC using the platinum doublet cisplatin and irinotecan, Three years after the last patient has completed treatement|Estimate the progression-free survival, Three years after the last patient has completed treatement.
Compare the survival of patients treated with cisplatin/irinotecan with historical controls using cisplatin/etoposide., Three years after the last patient has completed treatment.|Measure toxicities and compliance of patients on this regimen, Thirty days after completing treatment, averaging 100 days.
Patients with histological documented non-small cell lung cancer, that are considered to be inoperable, meet all the eligibility criteria, and sign informed consent will be treated with one cycle of irinotecan and cisplatin, followed by three additional cycles of chemotherapy with 60 - 70 Gy of concurrent radiation therapy.
