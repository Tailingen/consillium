Hypomethylating Agent and Venetoclax After Allo-HSCT in Patients With High-risk Myeloid Malignancies.
The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with hypomethylating agent and Venetoclax to improve leukemia free survival for high-risk myeloid malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .
Hypomethylating Agent|Venetoclax|Myeloid Malignancy
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine or decitabine
Leukemia-free survival (LFS) time, Summary statistics for LFS time will be computed for all patients., From the date of transplantation, assessed up to 1 year after transplantation.
Cumulative incidence of relapse, Use the method of Gooley et al to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse., From the date of transplantation, assessed up to 1 year after transplantation.|Overall survival, The method of Kaplan and Meier will be used to estimate the distribution of overall survival. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be used to model the association between overall survival and covariates of interest., From the date of transplantation, assessed up to 1 year after transplantation.|Incidence of toxicity of the regimen, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events., From the date of transplantation, assessed up to 1 year after transplantation.
This is a prospective single-arm study. Patients with high-risk AML or MDS aged between 18-70 years old will enroll in the study. They will be given hypomethylating agents (azacytidine 32mg/m2 or decitabine 5mg/m2) for 5 days and venetoclax 400mg/d for 7 days after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The maintenance therapy will start from 60th days posttransplant, repeated every 28 days until up to 1-year posttransplant. The 1-year leukemia-free survival rateï¼Œ1-year cumulative recurrence rate, and 1-year overall survival will be analyzed.
