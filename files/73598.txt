Fluid Therapy During Brain Tumor Resection in Children
Fluid management of children during neurosurgery is not well established. Hypotonic solutions, commonly still used in pediatric patients, may enhance cerebral edema and worse operative conditions. This study compares two different isotonic solutions administered perioperatively regarding acid base and fluid electrolyte disturbances.
Brain Neoplasms
DRUG: balanced crystalloid solution (components: sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride)|DRUG: 0.9% sodium chloride
serum chloride difference (mmol/L), Serum chloride will be collected in two different moments: right before the beginning of the surgery and right after de end of the procedure. We will calculate the difference between the two values., from the admission of the patient in the operating room until the end of the surgery.
serum chloride difference (mmol/L), Serum chloride will be collected right after the end of the surgery as well as 24 hours after the admission in ICU. We will calculate the difference between the two values., from the end of the surgery until exactly 24 hours after the admission in intensive care unit (ICU)|brain relaxation score, immediately after dura-mater opening|serum sodium difference (mmol/L), Serum sodium will be collected in two different moments: right before the beginning of the surgery and right after de end of the procedure. We will calculate the difference between the two values., from the admission of the patient in the operating room until the end of the surgery.
