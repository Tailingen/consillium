Effect of Chemoradiotherapy on Nutritional Status in Advanced NPC Patients
This is an prospective，open-label, none-interventional, observational， multicenter phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to observe the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy(CCRT) on nutritional status in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC) patients, analyse the changes of patients' nutrition status during the treatment and the connection between nutrition changes and curative effects, evaluate nutritional risks under the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CCRT and provide data and basis for further study。
