Arsenic Trioxide and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether the combination of arsenic trioxide with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is safe, and what effects it has on chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Arsenic trioxide
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Toxicity, To assess the safety and toxicity of arsenic in combination with TKI therapy for chronic phase CML patients, 1, 2, 6, 12 months
Disease Response, To assess disease response after combined therapy arsenic trioxide and imatinib (cohort 1), dasatinib (cohort 2) or nilotinib (cohort 3) by bone marrow cytogenetic assessment and serial BCR-ABL QPCR from peripheral blood and bone marrow measurements. Rates of major and complete cytogenetic and molecular responses will be determined., 1, 2, 6, 12 months|PML Expression, To assess whether combined therapy with arsenic and imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib results in decreased PML expression on the CML stem cell compartment, and decreased capacity of CML stem cells to maintain long term proliferative capacity., 1, 6, 12 months
