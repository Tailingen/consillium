cMet CAR RNA T Cells Targeting Breast Cancer
An open-label, clinical trial of autologous cMet redirected T cells administered intratumorally (IT) in patients with breast cancer. Fifteen evaluable patients will be enrolled in stepwise fashion. Step 1 will enroll patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to at least 1 standard therapy, step 2 will include newly diagnosed patients with operable triple negative breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: cMet RNA CAR T cells
Number of Serious Adverse Event, Two years
This study is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of intratumoral administration of autologous T cells that have had genetic material transferred into the cell to redirect them to target breast cancer cells rather than their usual target. Eligible subjects will have metastatic breast cancer refractory to at least one standard therapy or to newly diagnosed with operable triple negative breast cancer.
