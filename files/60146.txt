Phase IB Study to Evaluate RAD1901 on the Availability of Estrogen Receptor Binding Sites in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to visualize and quantify ER-binding sites during treatment with Elacestrant (RAD1901)
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: RAD1901
Effect of ER Binding after RAD1901 treatment, To determine the effect of RAD1901 treatment on the estrogen receptor (ER) expression and estradiol binding to the ER in lesions from patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC), 14 Days after the first dose
Correlation of FES uptake after RAD1901 treatment to clinical response, To determine if any changes in ER binding, as observed through FES uptake, correlate with clinical response, Every 8 weeks for to up 12 months of treatment|Tumor response will be evaluated in patients with measurable or evaluable disease, using RECISTv1.1 guidelines, To determine if there is a tumor response to RAD1901 treatment, Every 8 weeks for to up 12 months of treatment|Safety and Tolerability assessed in terms of adverse events, serious adverse events, ECG, physical examination, ECOG performance status, vital signs, and laboratory values, Characterization of the safety of RAD1901 in this patient population, Up to 30 days after the end of treatment|Plasma concentrations of RAD1901 will be assessed at predefined intervals, Pharmacokinetic data will be collected., Every 28 days for up to 3 cycles
The purpose of this study is to visualize and quantify ER-binding sites during treatment with Elacestrant (RAD1901) using 16α-18F-Fluoro-17β-estradiol (FES) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
