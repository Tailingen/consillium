A Trial on Different Dosages of Vitamin D in Preterm Infants With Late-onset Sepsis
This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the influence of different doses of vitamin D3 (800 IU/d versus 400 IU/d), on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha and C- reactive (CRP) in premature infants with clinical evidence of late-onset sepsis and to assess its influence on clinical outcomes of these infants.
Prematurity|Late-onset Sepsis
DRUG: High-dose vitamin D 3|DRUG: Conventional-Dose Vitamin D 3
Serum interleukin-6, Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) will be evaluated at enrollment and 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy. IL-6 concentrations will be determined by Endogenous Interleukin-ELISA, At trial entry and 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy|Serum tumor necrosis-alpha, Serum levels of tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) will be evaluated at enrollment and 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy, At trial entry and 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy
Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), Serum CRP will be evaluated at enrollment and 7 days, At trial entery and 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy|Serum 25(OH)D levels, Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured by ELISA at trial entry, at day 7 and at 40 weeks postmenstrual age, at trial entry, 7 days after daily vitamin D supplementation therapy and at 40 weeks postmenstrual age|Serum calcium, phosphorus and urinary calcium, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, serum calcium, phosphorus and urinary calcium well be assessed every week for an expected average of 5 weeks, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, serum calcium, phosphorus and urinary calcium well be assessed every week for an expected average of 5 weeks|Abdominal ultrasonography, Abdominal ultrasonography to detect any nephrocalcinosis will be done at 40 weeks postmenstrual age, 40 weeks postmenstrual age|Mortality, In-hospital mortality during NICU admission for an expected average of 5 weeks, Baseline|Neonatal morbidities, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, for an expected average of 5 weeks and the incidence of neonatal morbidities e.g. NEC, retinopathy of prematurity, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and renal dysfunction will be assessed, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, for an expected average of 4 weeks
Vitamin D has an important role in the regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. There are very few studies of such roles in the neonatal population. It is potentially an attractive therapeutic agent for sepsis given its low cost and low risk of toxicity and side effects. There is no consensus regarding to the dose of vitamin D supplementation required for preterm infants given the paucity of evidence. AAP and ESPGHAN have recommended different dosages of vitamin D ranging from 400 IU to 1000 IU per day. The influence of different doses of vitamin D on immunological status and clinical outcomes of preterm infants with late-onset sepsis has not been evaluated before. This RCT will evaluate the influence of different doses of vitamin D3 (800 IU/d versus 400 IU/d), on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha and C- reactive (CRP) in premature infants with clinical evidence of late-onset sepsis we will also evaluate their safety and influence on clinical outcomes of these infants
