Chemoradiation Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer
This is a Phase II study of cetuximab, carboplatin and radiotherapy (RT) in patients with Locally Advanced Head and Neck Carcinomas (LAHNC) who are unfit for cisplatin.

The aim of this study is to show the feasibility and safety profile of the combination of cetuximab, carboplatin and RT in treatment of patients with LAHNC.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Safety and Feasibility, An initial 6 patients will be treated. Once all these patients have a 2 week post RT review there will be analysis. If <= 1 patient has a DLT than the treatment is deemed safe.
Failure free survival (FFS), All patients will be followed until the last patient enrolled has a minimum follow up of 2 years post treatment.|Time to local and/or regional failure, All patients will be followed until the last patient enrolled has a minimum follow up of 2 years post treatment.|Overall survival, All patients will be followed until the last patient enrolled has a minimum follow up of 2 years post treatment.|Site of first failure, All patients will be followed until the last patient enrolled has a minimum follow up of 2 years post treatment.|Acute and late treatment toxicities, All patients will be followed until the last patient enrolled has a minimum follow up of 2 years post treatment.
Secondary objectives are to estimate failure free survival (FFS) and overall survival, to evaluate the time to local and regional failure and to determine the site of first failure (characterised as local, regional, distant or combinations). Acute and late treatment toxicities will also be evaluated.
