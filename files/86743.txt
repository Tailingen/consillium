Endoscopic Placement of Metal Stent in Patients With Cancer-Related Bowel Obstruction
RATIONALE: The use of endoscopy to place a metal stent in the large intestine is less invasive than surgery for treating cancer-related bowel obstruction and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of endoscopic placement of a metal stent in treating patients who have cancer-related bowel obstruction.

PROCEDURE: bowel obstruction management|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the objective response and clinical outcome in patients with colonic obstruction secondary to malignancy treated with enteral Wallstents.
* Evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment in these patients.
* Evaluate the quality of life of these patients after enteral Wallstent placement.

OUTLINE: All patient undergo a colonoscopy, followed by placement of an enteral Wallstent through an endoscope under fluoroscopic guidance into the large intestine.

Quality of life is assessed at 48 hours and 6 months after the procedure.

Patients are followed at 48 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and then yearly thereafter until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
