Are Sporadic Colorectal Cancers in Young Distinct From Elderly?
In this study, the investigators compared and evaluated the clinicopathological and oncological characteristics of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) in young adults without genetic mutations associated with hereditary CRC syndrome and sporadic CRC in elderly individuals.
Colorectal Neoplasms
Overall survival outcome in young colorectal cancer (yCRC) and elderly colorectal cancer (eCRC), The 3-year overall survival (OS) in yCRC and eCRC, The OS was defined as the time period from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up up to 3 years
Cancer-specific survival outcome in young colorectal cancer (yCRC) and elderly colorectal cancer (eCRC), The 3-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) in yCRC and eCRC, CSS was defined as the time period from the date of surgery to the date of death from CRC up to 3years
The ambiguity in the findings among several previous studies might be because of the difference in the age of the study population, yCRC and eCRC. The family history of CRC and cancer due to Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were also not excluded in such previous studies. Most importantly, those studies did not rule out the risk of hereditary cancer through the genetic testing in yCRC. Since hereditary CRC accounts for approximately 34% of those under the age of 35 years, it is necessary to exclude it to accurately compare the clinicopathological characteristics of sporadic cancer developed in yCRC and eCRC.
