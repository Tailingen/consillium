A Study to Evaluate Apatinib (Also Known as Rivoceranib) Plus Nivolumab in Participants With Unresectable or Metastatic Cancer
This is an open-labeled, single-center, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of apatinib with nivolumab treatment in participants with unresectable or metastatic cancer. Total study duration will be approximately 50 months: 12 months of recruitment plus 6 months of treatment and subsequent survival follow up.
Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants who Achieve Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), ORR per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and/or iRECIST criteria., Up to approximately 5 years|Best Overall Response Rate (BOR), BOR is the best response, according to RECIST v1.1 and/or RECIST criteria, recorded over the duration of the study until disease progression, or recurrence., Up to approximately 5 years|Time To Response (TTR), TTR is the time lapsed from enrollment until documented response according to RECIST v1.1 and/or iRECIST criteria., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is the time from documented tumor response (PR or CR) until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of participants with radiologically documented stable or decreased tumor burden per RECIST v1.1 and/or iRECIST criteria., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Disease Control (DDC), DDC is the time from enrollment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression will be evaluated by RECIST v1.1 and/or iRECIST criteria., Up to approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from participant enrollment until death from any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as time from enrollment to a \> 20% increase tumor size from baseline by RECIST v1.1, development of distant metastatic disease, or death., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from start of apatinib treatment to either radiological progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years
Primary objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apatinib with nivolumab in participants with unresectable or metastatic cancer.
* To assess efficacy by objective response rate (ORR), best overall response (BOR), time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DoR) per response evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and/or response evaluation criteria for solid tumors for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST).
* To assess disease control rate (DCR), and duration of disease control (DDC) by RECIST v1.1, and/or iRECIST.

Secondary objectives:

* To evaluate the efficacy of apatinib with nivolumab in participants with unresectable or metastatic cancer as measured by:
* Overall survival (OS)
* Progression-free survival (PFS)
* Event-free survival (EFS)
