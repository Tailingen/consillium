Laparoscopy-Assisted Transanal Endoscopy Rectosigmoid Resection for Rectal Cancer
Transanal Endoscopic Rectosigmoid Resection with Laparoscopic Assistance was developed at Massachusetts General Hospital and performed successfully to remove cancer of the lower rectum. Based on the outcomes, the research doctors believe that this investigational surgery may be as safe and effective as standard laparoscopic or open surgery performed to remove rectal cancer, may facilitate the operation and reduce the size of the abdominal incisions. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if this investigational procedure is a safe and effective approach to remove rectal cancer of the mid and lower rectum.
Adenocarcinoma of the Rectum
PROCEDURE: Transanal endoscopic surgery
Adequacy of the total mesorectal excision based on standard guidelines on pathologic evaluation of TME specimens., 1-5 years
Incidence of 30-day perioperative complications including intraoperative, surgical postoperative, and medical postoperative complications., 1-5 years|Incidence of long-term complications, 1-5 years|Oncologic outcomes in subjects receiving transanal endoscopic rectosigmoid resection, 1-5 years
Subjects will have their rectal cancer removed using a technique combining surgery through the anus and standard laparoscopy. At the end of the procedure, the rectum will be removed though the anus, the bowel will be re-connected to the anus, and a temporary diverting stoma will be created, which is standard of care following surgery for this type of cancer.
