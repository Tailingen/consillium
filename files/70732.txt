Scoring System for Thyroid Gland Pathologies
Although anamnesis and physical examination remain the place in the evaluation of patients today; laboratory values, imaging methods and pathology results have come to the fore in the decision-making of surgery for patients. As a result of all other criteria, a follow-up decision can be changed in a patient with a single fine needle aspiration biopsy result, or despite all the examinations the investigators have, a clear result cannot be achieved, and patient management may be disrupted. A holistic approach to thyroid gland pathologies is planned thanks to the scoring system that will be created in this study.
Thyroid Nodule|Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Thyroidectomy|PROCEDURE: Lobectomy
Age, Years, Before Surgery|Gender, Male - Female, Before Surgery|Smoking Status, Yes or No, Before Surgery|Radiation to the Neck Area, Yes or No, Before Surgery|History of Thyroiditis, Yes or No, Before Surgery|Family History, Presence of family members with any thyroid pathologies especially thyroid cancer, Before Surgery|Complaint, Months, Before Surgery|Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System ( TIRADS ) score, Radiological features of throid nodule ( minimum value is 1 maximum value is 5 ); thyroid nodule which has a higher value means a worse outcome, Before surgery|Bethesda classification system for thyroid fine needle aspirates, Histopathological features of thyroid nodule ( minimum value is 1 maximum value is 6 ) thyroid nodule which has higher value means a worse outcome, Before surgery|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) levels, it is a hormone secreted from the pituitary gland and triggers the functioning of the thyroid gland ( cut of values are 0.5 - 5.0 mIU / L ), Before surgery|Pathology results, The result of the throid gland part sent to the pathology unit after surgery ( the results can be benign or malign ), Immediately after the surgery
In routine clinical practice, the criteria the investigators consider during the pre - op period in patients evaluated due to thyroid pathologies include anamnesis, physical examination, laboratory values, especially thyroid function, thyroid-neck ultrasonographies, fine needle aspiration biopsies, according to which decisions about operation or nonoperative follow-up are made with the patient. The investigators aim to create a common scoring system by taking into account the pathology results of patients who have undergone thyroidectomy and comparing these results with the results of pre-op examination and thus to address patient management in a more objective and comprehensive way.
