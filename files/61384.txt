Alpelisib (BYL719) in Combination With Continued Endocrine Therapy Following Progression on Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative, PIK3CA Mutant Metastatic Breast Cancer
Patients who have histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable (not amenable to curative therapy) breast cancer may be screened for eligibility. All patients must have HER2 negative breast cancer with the identified PIK3CA mutation and received at least one line of endocrine therapy. The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post-treatment phase which includes safety, efficacy, and follow-up. The treatment phase will include taking alpelisib daily in combination with continued use of either Fulvestrant or Aromatase Inhibitor per standard of care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Carcinoma|HER2-negative Breast Cancer|PIK3CA Mutant Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Aromatase inhibitor
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. PFS defined as time from D1 of treatment with alpelisib with endocrine therapy., From enrollment until the time of disease progression, up to 60 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. ORR will include confirmed complete response (CR) and confirmed partial response (PR) as determined by RECIST 1.1, From enrollment until the time of disease progression, up to 60 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), To estimate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. CBR will include the sum of CR + PR + stable disease (SD) on treatment with alpelisib with endocrine therapy., From enrollment until the time of disease progression, up to 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR), To estimate the duration of response (DoR) of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. DOR is defined as the time that measurement criteria are met CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease PD) is objectively documented., From enrollment until the time of disease progression, up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), To estimate the overall survival (OS) of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation with alpelisib with endocrine therapy following progression until death as a result of any cause., From enrollment until the time of death, up to 60 months|Safety Profile of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy(aromatse inhibitor or fulvestrant), To estimate grade 3-4 adverse events or events of any grade leading to dose adjustments of alpelisib with continued endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) following progression in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, PIK3CA mutant metastatic breast cancer. Grade 3-4 toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5 or events of any grade leading to dose adjustments., From enrollment until 30 days after completion of study therapy or subject withdrawal, up to seven months
