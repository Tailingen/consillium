PERIOPERATIVE TREATMENT WITH COI-B (CAPECITABINE, OXALIPLATIN, IRINOTECAN AND BEVACIZUMAB) OF HIGH RISK OR BORDERLINE RESECTABLE COLORECTAL CANCER LIVER METASTASES
Capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab as perioperative strategy of borderline and/or high risk resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases
Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
DRUG: capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab
Pathological response rate, Primary:

- To evaluate the activity of the regimen with regards to major/complete pathological response. Major/complete pathological response is measured by pathologist in terms of tumor regression grade (TRG) as described by Rubbia-Brandt L, Annals of Oncology 2007 (percentage of vial residual cells 0-10%)., Assessed at the time of surgery of liver metastases (between weeks 17-20 from enrollment)
RECIST Response rate, - Response rate according to RECIST vers. 1.1 criteria, Available at week 9 after enrollment
Previous studies demonstrated a significant association between tumor regression grade of hepatic colorectal metastases (TRG1: complete pathological response; TRG2: major pathological response; TRG3: partial pathological response; versus TRG4-5 no pathological response) and outcome in terms of survival after neoadjuvant treatment. In particular, retrospective data showed an association between oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and improvement of grade and percentage of tumor regression; moreover, the addition of Bevacizumab seems to improve TRG over chemotherapy alone, conferring also a protection against liver damage due to chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

This is the rationale that induced us to carry out an evaluation and feasibility assessment of a perioperative approach with COI-B regimen in patients affected by high risk or borderline resectable colorectal liver metastases, with or without previous resection of primary tumor.
