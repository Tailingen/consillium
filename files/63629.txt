International Multicentric Study ARON-1
The ARON-1 Study is designed as an International Multicentric Retrospective Study to collect global experiences with the use of immuno-combinations in patients with metastatic RCC.

Two Supplementary Studies (ARON-1α and ARON-1β) have been designed. The ARON-1α Supplementary Study has been designed to investigate for the presence of genomic signatures from tumor samples of patients treated with first-line immuno-combinations for advanced RCC. The ARON-1β Supplementary Study has been designed to charaterize the immune cell populations and assess their relationship with the clinical outcome of mRCC patients treated with first-line immuno-combinations
