Capecitabine Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer After Chemo-immunotherapy and Surgery
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacity and safety of pembrolizumab and capecitabine on the invasive disease-free survival, in participants who have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy associated with pembrolizumab.
Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Pembrolizumab injection|DRUG: Capecitabine tablets|RADIATION: Local radiotherapy
2-year Invasive Disease-free survival (iDFS), Invasive disease free survival (iDFS) defined as time from randomization to the first of the following events: local, regional or distant recurrence, or second primary cancer (including contralateral) or death due to any cause., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From inclusion to death of any cause, up to 3.5 years.|Distant disease-free survival (DDFS), Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) is defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of distant relapse or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout study completion, up to 3.5 years.|Efficacy (iDFS, OS and DDFS), iDFS, OS and DDFS will also be compared to the external cohort of TNBC patients without pCR after NAC and treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab as part of standard of care after surgery ., Throughout study completion, up to 3.5 years.|Acute and late toxicity during the study, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 3.5 years.
We propose to evaluate the benefit in 2-year iDFS and safety of adding capecitabine to pembrolizumab in post-operative phase of pembrolizumab-containing treatment, in the subgroup of localized TNBC patients with residual disease.

An external cohort with patients treated with pembrolizumab as part of standard care after surgery, for localized TNBC without pCR after NAC, and with similar eligibility criteria, will be registered in an ambispective way, allowing comparisons between the experimental arm and this external cohort. All the centers involved in the study will participate in the registration of the needed information concerning this cohort.
