Two-cycle and Three-cycle Induction Therapy with Modified TPF Regimen Combined and Camrelizumab for LANPC
This prospective, phase II, multicenter, randomized controlled study aims to compare the complete response rate and long-term survival outcomes of two-cycle and three-cycle induction therapy with modified TPF regimens combined with camrelizumab in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Complete response, Complete Remission after induction therapy means that all detectable signs of the tumor have disappeared, including all measurable and assessable diseases. This includes the absence of any tumor lesions in imaging studies., At the end of Cycle 2 or Cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was measured from the day of the NPC diagnosis until disease recurrence and death from any cause., 3 years|Overall survival, Overall survival was measured from the day of the NPC diagnosis until death due to any cause., 3 years
Currently, the recommended number of cycles for induction chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma primarily suggests two-three cycles of induction therapy. However, several studies have found that three cycles of induction therapy did not improve patient survival and may further increase hematological toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to those treated with two cycles of induction therapy. Based on research from our center, three cycles of induction therapy also did not improve patient survival. The latest 2024 CSCO guidelines have recommended that immunotherapy can be incorporated into the induction therapy stage for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, based on these research findings, the investigators hypothesize that two cycles of induction chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy will not be inferior to three cycles in terms of tumor response rates and may have lower adverse reactions. The investigators aim to compare the complete response rates and long-term survival outcomes of two-cycle and three-cycle modified TPF regimens combined with camrelizumab in patients with locally advanced (T1-4N2-3M0) nasopharyngeal carcinoma, providing new options for toxicity-reduced treatment in nasopharyngeal cancer.
