68Ga-RM2 for PET/CT of Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPr) Expression in Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named 68Ga-RM2 can show prostate cancer on a PET/CT scan. 68Ga-RM2 stands for Galium-68 labeled DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethylpiperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2. This study is being done because there are unmet medical needs to improve the current ways of detecting prostate cancers before surgery.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: 68Ga-RM2 (RM2)|DEVICE: PET/CT Scan
Localizing Tumors, Localization will be defined using a total of 12 regions within the prostate: right and left base, midgland and apex in both peripheral and transition zones. The uptake on each region will be assessed by a radiologist blinded to standard of care imaging and clinical characteristics. Histopathological confirmation will be used as the gold standard., within two weeks prior to the planned prostatectomy
