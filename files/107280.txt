Safety and Efficacy of 21 Gy, 23 Gy and 25 Gy for High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate Brachytherapy
The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the outcomes and early and late side effects of treating early stage prostate cancer with high dose rate brachytherapy.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Neoplasm
RADIATION: HDR brachytherapy
Biochemical control experienced by patients with prostate cancer treated with an HDR implant, -Response will be determined by PSA. The Phoenix definition will be used for determining biochemical failure: a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the PSA nadir, Through 3 years after implant
Rate of acute toxicity experienced by patients with prostate cancer treated with an HDR implant, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., From start of treatment through 90 days|Rate of late toxicity experienced by patients with prostate cancer treated with an HDR implant, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., From day 91 through 3 years after implant
Optimal dose of radiation, -The optimal dose is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity within the DLT assessment period (3 months after implant) OR the maximally administered dose if fewer than 2 patients in that cohort experience DLT., Through 3 months after completion of implant for all patients enrolled (estimated to be 5 years and 3 months)
