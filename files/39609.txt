Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Transurethral Prostate Resection (TURP) and Transurethral Bladder Tumour Resection (TURB)
To investigate the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing TURP and TURB. The investigators set up a prospective, randomized controlled trial in which (after exclusion of risk factors) patients will be randomized in receiving levofloxacin (Tavanic) orally or no antibiotics. The exclusion criteria for TURP are a pre-operative transurethral catheter or \> 100 urinary white blood cells in the pre-operative urine sample. The exclusion criteria for TURB are a pre-op catheter or clinical signs of infection.

DRUG: Levofloxacin
% of patients with a post-operative infection., Urosepsis, fever (tÂ°\> 38.5) or epididymitis., From immediately post-op until at the control consultation 4 weeks after surgery.
Incidence of post-operative bacteriuria., \> 100.000 bacteria/mL urine, From immediately post-op until at the control consultation 4 weeks after surgery.
Main objective:

To investigate the safety of omitting antibiotic prophylaxis in TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) and TURB (transurethral bladder tumour resection) in patients without a pre-operative catheter or \> 100 WBC in the pre-operative urinary sample (TURP) or clinical signs of urinary infection (TURB).

Secondary objective:

To investigate post-operative bacteriuria after TURB and TURP in our population.

Principal inclusion criterium:

Patients undergoing TURP or TURB.

Primary exclusion criterium:

TURP: pre-operative catheter or \> 100 white blood cells in the pre- operative urinary sample.

TURB: pre-operative catheter or clinical signs of infection (fever, nyctalgia).

Primary endpoint:

Post-operative infection.

Secondary endpoint:

Post-operative bacteriuria.
