Duration of Response, for PIT-treated lesions, Duration of Response (DoR; Duration of Response is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to the time of disease progression (PD) of PIT-treated lesions per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by central reviewer., 24 months|Assess effects on tumor response, for PIT-treated lesions, Disease Control Rate (complete response, CR + partial response, PR + stable disease, SD) for PIT-treated lesions per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by central reviewer., 24 months|Assess effects on tumor response, Confirmed ORR for all lesions, For all lesions per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by central reviewer:

• Confirmed ORR (CR or PR), 24 months|Assess effects on tumor response, Disease control rate for all lesions, For all lesions per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by central reviewer:

It has four-point scales for the first 28 items. The minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 4. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. Overall health was evaluated as a 7-point response scale as the other two questions in that scale. The minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 7. Higher scores mean a better outcome., 12 months|Assess effects on quality of life, EORTC head and neck specific module (EORTC QLQ H&N 35), Change from baseline in EORTC head and neck specific module (EORTC QLQ H\&N 35). It has 4-point scales for the first 30 items. The minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 4. It has 2-point scales for the last 5 items. The minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 2. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems., 12 months|Assess effects on quality of life, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head & Neck Cancer Symptom Index - 10 Item (FHNSI-10), Proportion of patients who achieve a clinically meaningful benefit in symptoms, as measured by a 5-point improvement in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head \& Neck Cancer Symptom Index - 10 Item (FHNSI-10) from baseline to measured best assessment. The minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 4. Higher scores mean a worse outcome., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, AUC₀-ₜ (AUC, area under the concentration-time curve), Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 through the last measurable time point., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, AUC₀-₂₆, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 until 26 hours after infusion initiation (just prior to light treatment)., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, AUC₀-∞, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 through the last measurable time point and extrapolated to infinity., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, AUCₐₗₗ, Area under the concentration-time curve using all available data from 0 through 2 weeks post dose., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, Cₘₐₓ (maximum observed drug concentration), Maximum observed concentration., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, tₘₐₓ (time to maximal concentration), Time of maximum observed concentration., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, t₁/₂ (mean terminal elimination half-life), The observed terminal elimination half-life., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, CL (volume of serum cleared of drug per unit time), The volume of serum cleared of drug per unit time following IV dosing (ASP-1929 only)., 12 months|Characterize population pharmacokinetics of ASP-1929, Vₛₛ (volume of distribution at steady state following intravenous administration), Volume of distribution following IV dosing (ASP-1929 only)., 12 months|Characterize presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Proportion of patients with anti-ASP-1929 antibodies., 24 months
A Single-arm Study of ASP-1929 Photoimmunotherapy Combined With Pembrolizumab.

Patients will receive the approved label dose of pembrolizumab, which is administered every 3 weeks on days 1 and 22 of each treatment cycle.

On Day 8 of each cycle, patients will receive ASP-1929 followed by illumination at accessible tumor sites using the investigational PIT690 Laser System on Day 9.

Each treatment cycle, which is driven by ASP-1929 PIT frequency of administration, will last 42 days. Patients will be treated with ASP-1929 PIT and pembrolizumab for up to 12 months with a maximum of 8 treatment cycles.
