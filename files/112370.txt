Developing and Evaluating a Novel Approach to Improve HPV Vaccination Coverage Among High-risk, Under-immunized Adults Via the Emergency Department
To determine if the emergency department (ED) setting offers a viable space for improving HPV vaccination coverage among 18 to 45-year-old adults who have not yet received human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination or who did not complete the vaccine series. This study will develop, pilot and evaluate an ED-based HPV vaccination protocol and program for ED patients aged 18-26 (for whom catch-up HPV vaccination is routinely recommended by the CDC) and separately for patients aged 27-45 (for whom it may be recommended under shared decision making, SDM).
