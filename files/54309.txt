A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of TT-01488 in Patients With B-Cell Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the TT-01488 tablet, a non-covalent reversible BTK inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with B-cell malignancies.

The study will consist of two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. A modified 3+3 design will be used to guide the dose escalation and the determination of the dose recommended for dose expansion (DRDE). A sentinel cohort comprising of one subject will be enrolled at a starting dose of 50 mg q.d. Subsequently, patients will be enrolled according to the standard 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the DRDE. Once the DRDE has been selected, TT-01488 of DRDE will be further tested in the dose expansion cohort to verify the safety and preliminary efficacy as observed in the dose escalation cohorts. A recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) may be determined based on the totality of safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy data from the dose escalation cohorts and dose expansion cohort.
