CD19-targeting 3rd Generation CAR T Cells for Refractory B Cell Malignancy - a Phase I/IIa Trial.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with B cell lymphoma or leukemia. The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with three intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
B Cell Lymphoma|B Cell Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous 3rd generation CD19-targeting CAR T cells
CAR T cell persistence, Presence of circulating CAR T cells will be evaluated with flow cytometry and real time PCR in patient blood., At week 1 and 5, there after every 3 months post treatment up to 24 months
Tumor load, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis., Every 3 months post treatment up to 24 months
B cell number and immunoglobulins, Number of blood B cells and immunoglobulins will be evaluated by routine diagnostics, Weekly for 5 weeks, then every 3 months post treatment up to 24 months
