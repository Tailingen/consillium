Risk Factors of Relapse in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancers Who Achieve PCR to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
It has been reported that patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who achieved pathological complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy have better survival than those with non-PCR. Howeve, there is still recurrent diseases developed in PCR patients after esophagectomy. Herein, we aimed to investgate the risk factors of recurrence in PCR patients.
Esophageal Cancer
OTHER: follow up
recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the date of esophagectomy to the date of first detected recurrent disease, 2008-2018
Between January 2008 and December 2018, a total of 96 patients with pathological complete response were enrolled in this study. Sterilized lymph nodes (SLN) were defined as those lymph nodes without residual tumor but with the presence of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses.
