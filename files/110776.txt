Proteomic Profiling in Predicting Response in Patients Receiving Erlotinib for Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue, blood, and urine in the laboratory from patients receiving erlotinib may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: The phase II trial is studying proteomic profiling to see how well it predicts response in patients receiving erlotinib for stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To define a pre-treatment tumor proteomic profile that predicts response, stable disease, or progressive disease in patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride.

Secondary

* To test and refine a pre-treatment serum proteomic expression pattern that predicts response to erlotinib hydrochloride and/or carboplatin and paclitaxel after failing treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride.
* To test and refine tumor proteomic profiles that predict response to carboplatin and paclitaxel after failing treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride.
* To analyze individual and pattern(s) of erlotinib hydrochloride-induced genomic and proteomic biomarker changes in relation to response or non-response to treatment.
* To correlate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib hydrochloride with expression of EGFR, EGFR pathway, ErbB family, and other related biomarkers.
* To determine a set of biomarkers to be evaluated in tumor tissue or surrogate tissues prior to treatment with erlotinib hydrochloride to enable patient selection for therapy.
* To estimate response rate and progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with erlotinib hydrochloride as initial therapy.
* To characterize the safety profile of erlotinib hydrochloride in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily until disease progression.

At the time of disease progression, patients receive standard chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Patients with non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses.

Tumor tissue, plasma, serum, and urine samples are collected at baseline for proteomics analysis.

After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.
