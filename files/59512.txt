For this study losartan, an angiotensin-II inhibitor, is defined as the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The focus of the study is to assess the dose-response relationship of losartan on imaging-based measures of tissue perfusion and mechanical forces in patients with brain tumors. We hypothesize that losartan improves the effect of traditional cancer treatment by alleviating mechanical forces (solid stress) of the tumor microenvironment to improve tissue perfusion, while administration of losartan alone has little effect on cancer patients.

This is an open-label study and no active comparator or placebo will be used. Study participants include adult patients with newly diagnosed- and recurrent glioblastoma, as well as adult patients with metastatic brain tumors from non-small cell lung cancer. The study will assess the safety of losartan treatment and its dose-response relationship on conventional and experimental radiographic characteristics when used alone or as an add-on to standard cancer treatment.
