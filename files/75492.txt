The results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that the combination of oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-Fu introduced by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for advanced stage HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control study to determine the recommended dose as well as the safety and efficacy.
