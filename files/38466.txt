Follicular Fluid Raman Shifts and IVF Outcomes
This study intends to collect about 150 cases of follicular fluid samples from PCOS and non-PCOS infertility patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles (in clinical routines).We tend to detect Raman metabolic profile of the follicular fluid of the PCOS and non-PCOS groups, and find the correlation between the metabolic profile of the follicular fluid of PCOS patients and the oocyte quality, IVF outcome and subsequent embryo development are also under investigation. Metabolomics analysis was applied to look for markers of follicular fluid in PCOS patients, and further exploring data and strategies to improve the embryonic development potential and IVF outcome of PCOS patients.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|IVF
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Raman spectrum
Difference between polycystic ovary syndrome and normal follicular fluids, Raman spectrum was applied and the Raman spectrum characteristic absorption peak can be revealed. PCA analysis was used to measure the degree of differential shifts., 24 months
