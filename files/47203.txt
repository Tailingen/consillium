A Study of ABC294640 (Yeliva ®) Alone and in Combination With Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate in Treatment of Patients With Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma
ABC-108 is a single-arm Phase IIA clinical study of ABC294640 (Yeliva ®, opaganib) alone and in combination with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In Part 1 of this clinical study, all participants will be receiving ABC294640 and in Part 2 all participants will be receiving ABC294640 and HCQ to explore the drugs activity signal in CCA. The study drug, ABC294640 is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2). SK2 is an innovative target for anti-cancer therapy because of its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to regulate tumor cell death and proliferation. ABC294640 also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, in a recent Phase I trial, ABC294640 demonstrated clinical activity in CCA patients. HCQ, is an orally available, FDA approved therapy for the treatment of malaria as well as discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also known as an inhibitor of autophagy, a pro-survival mechanism utilized by many cancers. Evidence indicates that inhibition of autophagy can increase the therapeutic activity of ABC294640 in CCA. In Part 1 of this study, ABC294640 will be continuously administrated orally, twice a day, in 28 day cycles. In Part 2, ABC294640 and HCQ will be continuously administrated orally (the safe and tolerable will be determined in the study) in 28 day cycles. Administration of drug/s in both parts of the study will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or voluntary withdrawal initiated by the participants or physician.

Patient diaries will be filled on a daily basis during treatment.|MMSE score to measure safety and tolerability of ABC294640 alone and in combination with HCQ, MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) questionnaire will be utilized for evaluating the mental state of the participants., From screening, during each cycle of treatment, till the end of treatment (an estimated median of 4 months). Patient diaries will be filled on a daily basis during treatment.|Daily diary entries to aid in asessing safety and tolerability of ABC294640 alone and in combination with HCQ, Participants will be asked to fill a daily diary to record the drug administration and any side effects that they may experience., From screening, during each cycle of treatment, till the end of treatment (an estimated median of 4 months). Patient diaries will be filled on a daily basis during treatment.|Number of treatment-related Adverse Events alone and in combination with HCQ, Adverse events will be graded according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 4.03) to measure the safety and tolerability of treatment with ABC294640 alone and in combination with HCQ in patients with unresectable CCA., From screening till the 30 days after the end of treatment (an estimated median of 5 months)|The Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABC294640 and of HCQ, To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 (Part 1) and of ABC294640 and HCQ (Part 2) in the first 12 patients by measuring Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABC294640 and HCQ, From the first day of treatment until the beginning of second cycle of treatment (on day 1, 15, 28 approximately)|The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ABC294640 (Part 1) and of ABC294640 and HCQ (Part 2), To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 (Part 1) and of ABC294640 and HCQ (Part 2) in the first 12 patients by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ABC294640 and of HCQ which reflects the body exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug., From the first day of treatment until the beginning of second cycle of treatment (on day 1, 15, 28 approximately)|Determine the progression free survival (PFS), Every 2 months for a maximum of 24 months after the last participant has been entered to the study|Determine Disease Control Rate (DCR=CR+PR+SD), Determine Disease Control Rate (DCR) = complete response (CR)+ partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD), Every 2 months for a maximum of 24 months after the last participant has been entered to the study|Determine the overall survival (OS), Every 2 months for a maximum of 24 months after the last participant has been entered to the study
Determine the effect of treatment with ABC294640 alone or in combination with HCQ on pharmacodynamic markers that are associated with the mechanism of action of the drug., Tumor biopsies, when accessible, will be obtained and will be assessed for tumor signaling proteins (c-Myc, pAKT, SK2). Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) for c-Myc will be collected within 1 hour prior to the pre- and posttreatment biopsies (or at the scheduled time of biopsy if not performed)., Within 21 days prior to treatment and on the beginning of the second cycle of treatment (approximately a month)|Serial measurement of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), Serum ctDNA be assessed for mutational status and development of new mutations., Prior to treatment till the end of study (assessed at screening, beginning of cycle three of treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter, up to 24 months)
This is an open-label clinical study to explore the activity signal of ABC294640 and of ABC294640 and HCQ in adult subjects who have been diagnosed with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma either intra- perhilar or extra-hepatic. The study will be conducted at 5 sites in the USA.

For Part 1, a maximum of 39 participants evaluable for efficacy will be enrolled in the study. Eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg twice a day, continuously administered in 28 day cycles.

Part 2 will be a single-arm Phase IIA study identical to Part 1 but treatment will consist of both ABC294640 together with HCQ. Additionally, Part 2, will consist of two phases: Phase I: accelerate HCQ dose-escalation run-in starting with a HCQ dose of 200 mg QD (once a day). Based on safety results, patient cohorts will be expanded, and dosing will continue to 200 mg BID (twice a day), 400 mg BID and 600 BID. At the end of Part2, Phase I, it will be determined what is the safe and tolerable HCQ dose for Phase II.

For Part 2, up to 15 patients evaluable for safety and tolerability will be enrolled in Phase I component of Part 2; and 20 patients evaluable for efficacy in the Phase II component of Part 2. All eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg BID in addition to the determined HCQ dose, continuously administered in 28 day cycles.

In addition to physical, neurological and eye exams (eye exams only for participants receiving HCQ), blood and urine samples will be routinely collected for safety and to determine response to the study drugs. Participants will be radiographically assessed for disease status every 2 cycles of treatment.

Tumor biopsies, when accessible, will be obtained within 21 days prior to the beginning of treatment and again on the beginning of the second treatment cycle.

All participants will be followed every 2 months for progression and survival for a maximum of 24 months after the last patient has been entered to the study. Follow up procedures may include physical examination, laboratory work and radiographic tumor assessment.
