A Proof of Principle Study of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) - Induced Fluorescence Detection in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to measure ALA-induced fluorescence in both normal and malignant tissue.
Lung Cancer in Normal and Malignant Tumors
DRUG: ALA-induced Fluorescence
ALA-induced fluorescence- lung cancer, Determine the relationship between ALA induced protoporphyrin IX (PplX) flourescence and histology in both normal and malignant tumors., Participants will be followed for duration of the hospital stay, and up to 3 weeks after
Determine Feasibility of fluorescence, Determine feasibility of integrating fluorescence detection into surgical pratice of resection for lung cancer., Participants will be followed for the duration of their hospital study and up to 3 weeks after
The purpose of this trial is to measure ALA-induced fluorescence in both normal and malignant tissue.
