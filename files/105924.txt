Endostar for Locally Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether endostar and IMRT is effective in the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients compared with IMRT alone.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Endostatins|RADIATION: IMRT
Number of participants with grade 4-5 late adverse events as assessed by RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema, From 3 months after the end of IMRT to 1 year after the end of IMRT
Number of participants with severe acute toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v3.0, From the beginning of IMRT to 3 months after the end of IMRT|Overall survival, From the beginning the IMRT to 3 year after the end of IMRT
Locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be salvaged by intensity modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT), but severe late toxicities become the most common reason of death in IMRT salvaged NPC patients.

The aim of this phase II randomized controlled study is to address the efficacy of concurrent Endostar (Endostatins) with IMRT to reduce the occurrence of severe late toxicities compared with IMRT alone for locally recurrent NPC patients.
