The aim of the study is to develop a prognostic index for elderly patients with newly diagnosed cHL starting from a prospective observational study of consecutive cases registered after the completion of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) Prospective data collection study of a consecutive series of newly diagnosed elderly cHL patients undergoing CGA before any therapy with the use of ADL, IADL and CIRS-G. Patients who will be considered not eligible to receive treatment or to be given only palliative therapy after CGA assessment are eligible for the study. Patients will be screened and restaged according to clinical practice instrumental and laboratory assessments timing and type of examinations.
