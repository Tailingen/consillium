Phase II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed +/- OGX-427 in Untreated Stage IV Non-Squamous-Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
This randomized phase II study will compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed with and without OGX-427 in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: OGX-427|DRUG: Placebo
Median Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization to the date of first observation of progression based on radiological assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, or date of death from any cause, in the absence of progressive disease (PD) or censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Progressive Disease is defined by RECIST v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Every 6 weeks for up to 24 months
Number of OGX-427 Versus Placebo Participants With an Objective Response, Defined as the number of patients with objective evidence of complete or partial response (CR or PR) using RECIST v 1.1. A CR is the complete disappearance of all target lesions. A PR is a decrease in baseline of 30% or more of the diameter(s) of all target lesions., Every 6 weeks for up to 24 months|Median Overall Survival, Defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization to date of death from any cause, or censored at the date last known alive., Every 6 weeks for up to 41 months|Number of Patients With a Treatment-Related Adverse Event as a Measure of Safety., A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which was considered to have a relationship with the study drug (suspected to be possibly or probably related to the study drug per the Investigator's assessment). Adverse events were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03., Weekly during each 21 days cycle and for 30 days after last dose for up to 29 Months
Modern doublet chemotherapy improves survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with supportive care alone, with non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with platinum/pemetrexed living longer than patients treated with platinum/gemcitabine. Despite these advances, poor outcomes with advanced disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence in lung cancer models shows promising antitumor activity with OGX-427 in combination with platinum based therapy or pemetrexed. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study, pemetrexed and carboplatin plus OGX-427 followed by maintenance pemetrexed and OGX-427 will be compared with pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by maintenance pemetrexed and placebo in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
