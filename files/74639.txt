A Clinical Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Chidamide in Combination With Camrelizumab and Carboplatin or Capecitabine in the Second and Third Line Treatment of Relapsed/Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide in combination with camrelizumab and carboplatin or capecitabine in the second and third line treatment of relapsed/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: chidamide|DRUG: camrelizumab|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: capecitabine
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1. CR = Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Up to approximately 12 weeks
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time was censored at the date of randomization, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date., Up to approximately 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, Up to approximately 30 months]|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR is defined as cases where objective remission(assessed as complete remission or partial remission according RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study., Up to approximately 12 weeks|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) lasting 24 weeks or longer as defined in RECIST 1.1.CR = Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters; SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease: PD = At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20% the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, Up to approximately 12 weeks
This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label clinical study. Successfully screened patients with relapsed/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer will receive chidamide and camrelizumab at the prescribed doses Combined with carboplatin or capecitabine therapy, Chidamide single drug should be taken for lead-in therapy before combined therapy.
