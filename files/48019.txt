The favourable results of a number of phase III-trials with gefitinib in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR-mutations, have resulted in the licensing of gefitinib in this indication. This offers the prospect of a true personalized treatment of patients with NSCLC. Implementation of such a personalized treatment strategy is dependent both on the availability of adequate tumor samples for the EGFR-mutation analysis and on the timely reporting of the mutation analysis results. Ideally the results should be available in all patients within 2 weeks of the analysis request.
