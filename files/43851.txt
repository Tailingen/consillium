Evaluation of ENPP1 Expression and Immune Response in Bladder Cancer Patients
This study aims to investigate the role of ENPP1 in bladder cancer (BC), specifically focusing on its impact on immune evasion, chemoresistance, and prognosis. The study will analyze gene expression data from clinical samples and use various laboratory techniques, including RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry, to assess ENPP1's expression levels. In addition, the research will explore the relationship between ENPP1 and immune cell infiltration, along with its correlation with patient survival outcomes. By identifying ENPP1's contribution to cancer progression and treatment resistance, the study aims to discover potential therapeutic targets for improving bladder cancer treatment strategies.

ENPP1 Expression Levels in Bladder Cancer Patients, The primary outcome will measure the expression levels of ENPP1 in bladder cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its correlation with clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)., 2024.1-2024.6
This study is designed to comprehensively explore the role of ENPP1 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1) in bladder cancer (BC) development and progression. ENPP1 has been implicated in various cancers, with evidence suggesting its involvement in immune evasion, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis. However, its specific function in bladder cancer remains unclear. This research will analyze clinical samples, including tumor tissues and normal adjacent tissues, to evaluate ENPP1 expression through a combination of advanced laboratory techniques such as RNA sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence.

Furthermore, the study will investigate the association between ENPP1 expression and key clinical parameters, including tumor stage, grade, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and patient survival outcomes. Through bioinformatics tools, immune infiltration analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of ENPP1 on immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and M2 macrophages, which are crucial in the tumor microenvironment.

The research will also explore the correlation between ENPP1 expression and resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents, particularly gemcitabine and cytarabine, using drug sensitivity data from public databases. By identifying the molecular mechanisms by which ENPP1 influences immune responses and chemoresistance, the study aims to provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for bladder cancer treatment. Ultimately, this research may contribute to the development of personalized therapies for bladder cancer patients based on ENPP1 expression.
