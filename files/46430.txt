A Phase II Trial of Sutent (Sunitinib; SU011248) for Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma
We are asked patients to take part in this study because they had recurrent (returned) (1st or 2nd) anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

The purposes of this study are:

* To see if Sutent has any change on the patient and their cancer.
* To see if Sutent will slow or stop the growth of their tumor.
* To measure the safety of Sutent. Sutent is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat patients with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor after the disease worsened while taking another medicine called imatinib mesylate or when imatinib mesylate cannot be taken. Sutent is also FDA approved to treat patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. At this time, it is not known whether Sutent will improve symptoms, or help patients with this disease live longer.
Anaplastic Astrocytoma|Glioblastoma
DRUG: Sunitinib Malate
Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months Utilizing McDonald Criteria for Response, Progression and Relapse, Complete Response: Disappearance of all lesions, disease signs and symptoms related to the tumor. Partial Response (PR): When compared with pretreatment measurements, a reduction of 50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all target enhancing lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment started. Objective Progression or Relapse: Relative to pretreatment measurements, an increase in the sum of the diameters of any measured enhancing lesion by at least 25% increase in the sum of the longest diameters since the treatment started or the appearance of new enhancing lesions., 6 Months
Best Overall Response, To estimate best response rates (proportion of patients who ever had a radiographic response equal to or better than stable disease during course assessment)., 12 Months|Number of Participants With Related Grade 3 and Greater Adverse Events, To evaluate toxicities associated with sunitinib treatment (grade 3 and greater toxicities)., 12 Months
Trial patients received sunitinib 50 mg daily for 4 weeks without regard to meals, followed by a 2-week rest period. This 6-week regimen constituted 1 cycle. Patients were treated for up to 9 cycles \[\~ year) or until disease progression or death or if persistent toxicities occurred. Complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic profile, neurologic exam, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast were obtained after each cycle. Toxicity assessments were obtained after each cycle. Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 3.0.
