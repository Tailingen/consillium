Correlation Research of Thioredoxin Reductase in Lung Cancer
In pre-clinical study the investigators found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of serum harbours huge difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme activity elevated remarkably among cancer patients, so the investigators hypothesis that this is due to tumor cells loading of the patients, the enzyme activity may harbours huge difference between carcinoma tissues and para-carcinoma tissues in early staged non-small cell lung cancers, and after surgery, the enzyme activity may fall down to a normal level because of removing of tumor.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Benign Neoplasm of Lung
measure the thioredoxin reductase activity in blood, tumor and pericarcinomatous tissue, 3-4 ml blood should be taken and centrifuged in 30 mins, then the serum should be stored at -20 degree, then serum thioredoxin reductase activity should be measured in one month. Tumor and pericarcinomatous tissues should be stored at -180 degree and enzyme activity should be measured within one month, blood should be taken in 2 days before surgery, tumor and pericarcinomatous tissues should be stored and tested in one month
Measure the difference of thioredoxin reductase activity between lung cancer tissue and lung benign mass, Tumor tissue or lung benign mass obtained during surgery should be stored at -180 degree within 5 mins and enzyme activity should be measured within one month., Tumor tissue or lung benign mass obtained during surgery should be stored at -180 degree within 5 mins and enzyme activity should be measured within one month|Measure the thioredoxin reductase mRNA and protein expression in tumor and pericarcimomatous tissue, Tumor tissue or pericarcimomatous tissue should be stored at -180 degree, then qRT-PCR should be done within 3 months, Tumor tissue or pericarcimomatous tissue should be stored at -180 degree, then qRT-PCR should be done within 3 months
This is a cooperative research project in Thoracic Surgery Department and Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood and lung cancer tissue and measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression using lung cancer and pericarcinomatous tissue in early staged(Ⅰ\~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the correlations of thioredoxin reductase between blood and tissue. The secondary objectives are to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity between non small lung cancers and lung benign lesion patients to identify the difference between tumor and lung benign mass.
