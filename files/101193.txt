A Biomarker Study in Patients With HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Treated With Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel
To explore molecular biomarkers and/or gene expression signatures that predict response to bevacizumab given in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy in HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Identification of molecular biomarkers, To explore molecular biomarkers and/or gene expression signatures that predict response to bevacizumab given in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy in HER2 negative MBC., After the study completion,After completion of the study, which will take up to 3 years
Safety of metastatic biopsies during bevacizumab therapy, The safety objective of the study is to assess whether carrying out metastatic tissue biopsies during treatment with bevacizumab is safe. For this reason, the study will be initiated with a feasibility phase of 10 patients and will be continued to the randomized phase only if the study specific procedures prove to be safe., continuous assessment and after inclusion of 10 patients, After completion of the study which will take up to 1 year
Molecular changes by bevacizumab, To identify molecular changes in the tumor induced by the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy., After completion of the study which will take up to 3 years|Efficacy of bevacizumab, To measure the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel in HER2 negative MBC., After completion of the study, After completion of the study, which will take up to 3 years
This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, single-center, phase II trial. A total of 30 patients will be included during a period of 2 years.

The study will be initiated with a non-randomized, feasibility stage including ten patients who will be treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel, in order to determine the safety of metastatic tumor biopsies during therapy with bevacizumab.

In the second phase, patients will be randomized (1:1) between two treatment arms: A. Bevacizumab + paclitaxel and B. Paclitaxel
