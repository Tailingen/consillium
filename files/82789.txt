Value of Biological Age, in Addition to Individual Frailty, for Personalising the Management of Cancer Treated with Targeted Therapy
French prospective multicenter, open-label study involving newly diagnosed CML patients. Two assessments will be performed during the follow-up of these patients: individual frailty using geriatric tools and individual biological aging determined by DNA methylation analysis.
