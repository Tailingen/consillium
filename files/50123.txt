A Study of Revumenib in Combination With Chemotherapy in Participants With R/R Acute Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of revumenib when given in combination with 2 different chemotherapy regimens in participants with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias harboring KMT2A rearrangement, KMT2A amplification, NPM1c, or NUP98r.
