SC-004 Alone or With ABBV-181 in Subjects With Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Primary Peritoneal and Endometrial Cancers
This is a two-part study consisting of Part A (dose regimen finding) followed by Part B (dose expansion). Part A (dose regimen finding) will allow definition of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through dose escalation and possible dose interval modification. In Part B (dose expansion), potential therapeutic doses may be studied with SC-004 as monotherapy and SC-004 in combination with ABBV-181 in disease-specific cohorts.
Cancer
DRUG: SC-004|DRUG: ABBV-181
Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLTs graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03., Minimum first cycle of dosing (21-day cycles)
Observed plasma concentrations at trough (Ctrough), Observed plasma concentrations at trough., Approximately 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the subject's first dose date to death due to any cause., Approximately 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response or partial response (CR+PR)., Approximately 2 years|Terminal half life (T1/2), Terminal half life (T1/2)., Approximately 1 year|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed serum concentration., Approximately 1 year|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Time to Cmax., Approximately 1 year|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of subjects with an objective response or stable disease (CR+PR+SD)., Approximately 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the subject's first dose of study drug (Day 1) to either the subject's disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Under the situation that neither event occurs, the PFS time will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. Subjects lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose of study treatment will have their event time censored at Day 1., Approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the subject's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If the dates of disease progression or death are not available, the DOR will be censored at the date of last valid tumor assessment., Approximately 2 years|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve within a dosing interval (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve within a dosing interval., Approximately 1 year|QTcF Change from Baseline, QT interval measurement corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)., Up to 9 weeks based on 3 cycles of dosing (21-day cycles)|Duration of Clinical Benefit (DOCB), DOCB is defined as the time from a subject's objective response (CR or PR) or stable disease (SD) to study drug therapy to disease progression or death due to any cause whichever occurs first., Approximately 2 years
