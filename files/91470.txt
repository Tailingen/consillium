TIL for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
Background:

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy is a type of adoptive cellular therapy by harvesting infiltrated lymphocytes from tumors, culturing and amplifying them in vitro and then infusing back to patients.

TIL therapy has shown strong efficacy for the treatment of solid tumors and has achieved high objective response rates in multiple cancers, such as melanoma, NSCLC, and cervical cancer.

Objective:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of TIL for the patients with advanced solid tumor.

Eligibility:

Adults aging 18-75 with advanced solid tumor.

Design:

1. Patients will undergo screening tests, including imaging procedures, heart and lung tests, and lab tests.
2. Freshly resected patient tumors were dissected by the surgeon.
3. TIL cells were isolated from the patient's tumor tissue, then cultured in vitro, activated and expanded.
4. At last TIL cells will be re-infused into the patients.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cells
Safety of TIL, The safety of TIL will be assessed based on the totality of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse event (AE) data collected during this phase., Day 0 - Day 730
Overall Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the proportion of participants who have a confirmed partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by the investigator., Day 0 - Day 730|Duration of Response (DOR), To evaluate the duration from the time that criteria are met for CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by the investigator until disease progression or death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To evaluate the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR at any time plus stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by the investigator., Day 0 - Day 730|Progression free survival (PFS), To evaluate the time from the date of TIL infusion until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730|Overall survival (OS), To evaluate the time from the date of TIL infusion to death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730
