A Single-arm Exploratory Study of Neoadjuvant Therapy
Neoadjuvant EGFR TKI therapy targeting EGFR mutation has some problems failure to fulfill clinical requirements such as low MPR rate, tissue fibrosis and other major surgical impacts and unmet clinical needs.This study hypothesized that Tisleizumab combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of stage II-IIIA non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR-mutant PD-L1 expression ≥1% could significantly improve the pathological response rate after neoadjuvant therapy, improve the surgical complete resection rate, reduce perioperative complications and do not increase the surgical difficulty.In this study, biomarker analysis is going to explore the possible direction of neoadjuvant therapy population screening, and to explore a possible method for the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in clinical stage II-IIIA non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation and expression of PD-L1.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cis-platemum|DRUG: or carboplatin
Major pathologic response rate (MPR) （proportion of patients with no more than 10% remaining live tumor cells in the resected primary tumor and in all resected lymph nodes）, MPR of surgical specimens from patients who were operable after neoadjuvant therapy was evaluated, 15-18 weeks after enrollment
ORR: Proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among all randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline assessed according to RECIST version 1.1, To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) in neoadjuvant treatment, 6-12weeks after enrollment|pCR: proportion of patients with no residual tumor in resected primary tumor and lymph nodes, pCR of surgical specimens from patients who were operable after neoadjuvant therapy was evaluated, 15-18 weeks after enrollment|Descending rate of lymph nodes, Proportion of patients whose pathologic lymph node stage was reduced to N1/N0 by baseline radiographic assessment of N2 or N1, 15-18 weeks after enrollment|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, To evaluate the safety profile(Number of Participants with Adverse Events), through study completion, an average of 35weeks|The time of surgery delay, evaluate the interval time from the completation of last neoadjuvant therapy to surgery, 4-6weeks after completation of the last neoadjuvant therapy|minimally invasive surgery rate, explore different surgery manner rate after neoadjuvant, 4-6weeks after completation of the last neoadjuvant therapy
