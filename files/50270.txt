Safety, Efficacy, and Side Effects Study of Interventional Cryotherapy in the Pleural Space("ICE PLS")
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and side effects of the CryoSpray Ablation(TM) System (CSA(TM) System) to treat neoplastic lesions on the parietal pleural surface.
Cancer|Pleural Neoplasms
DEVICE: CryoSpray Ablation (TM) System
To Reduce Tumor Burden in the Pleural Space, as Determined by Visual Inspection and Biopsy of the Treatment Sites 2-5 Days Post Treatment. Safety Endpoint Clinical and Radiographic Status at 30 Days Post CryoSpray Treatment and Adverse Events., 1 year
To Determine if CryoSpray Causes a Pleurodesis Effect. To Determine if CryoSpray Affects Production of Malignant Effusion Within the Treated Pleural Cavity. To Determine if Pleural Cavity Treatment With CryoSpray is Dosimetry Dependent., 1 year
The proposed study is a pilot study consisting of an estimated 10 subjects with biopsy-proven metastatic cancer in the parietal pleural surface treated with CryoSpray at dye marked metastatic foci.

Initial treatment dosimetry will be up to 3 cycles of 10-40 second sprays. If necessary, dosimetry changes may occur after 3 subjects are treated and observed. It is unknown if dosimetry will need to be increased to enhance effectiveness. The PI may increase dosimetry by 1 cycle after each subject is treated and observed as a conservative approach to efficacy determination. If disease exists bilaterally, only one side will be sprayed.
