CX3CR1+T Cell Predict Immunotherapy Efficacy
This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the proportion of flow-sorted CX3CR1+T cells in peripheral blood and the CX3CR1+T-specific gene signature and the efficacy of immunotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor based immunotherapy
objective response rate（ORR）, Imaging findings of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) in all subjects evaluated according to RECIST V1.1 after completing 4 cycles of immunotherapy. best overall response (BoR) was evaluated in participants achieving complete and partial response., 4 weeks
progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time from surgery until disease progression or death from any cause, 1 year|overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery until death from any cause, 1 year
The status and abundance of T cells vary across tumor microenvironments (TMEs) may fundamentally influence response to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells showed high migration in and were enriched in the blood, whose amplification is strongly associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better survival. However, the prediction performance of CX3CR1+ T features and characteristics has not been fully validated. This study intends to conduct a clinical trial based on CX3CR1+ CD8+T Cell in peripheral blood to verify the association of proportion and specific transcriptome signature of CX3CR1+T Cell in immunotherapy efficacy prediction. With the help of RECIST 1.1 criteria, the investigators evaluate the clinical response after prescribed cycles of treatment to explore the correlation between peripheral blood markers and immunotherapy efficacy. To develop a low cost, robust and accurate prototype prediction model for NSCLC patients who take anti-PD-1 drugs is investigators final translational purpose.
