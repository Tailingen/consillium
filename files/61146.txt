Erythropoietin in the Treatment of Anemia After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
This is an randomized trial to evaluate the potential benefit of erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia in patients with lymphoma after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Anemia|Lymphoma|Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
DRUG: erythropoietin|DRUG: iron supplementation
complete hemoglobin response rate, proportion of complete correctors (reaching hemoglobin 120 g/L in male patients, 110 g/L in female patients) before day +60 post-transplant, from day +15 to day +60 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
proportion of participants with red blood cell transfusions, proportion of participants with red blood cell transfusions from day +15 to day +60 post-transplant, from day +15 to day +60 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|proportion of participants with deep vein thrombosis, proportion of participants with deep vein thrombosis from day +15 to day +60 post-transplant, from day +15 to day +60 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Lymphoma patients with anemia on day +15 post-transplant will be randomized to erythropoietin group or control group. Potential benefit of erythropoietin will be evaluatedon day +60 post-transplant.
