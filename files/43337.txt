Study of BTK Inhibitor LOXO-305 Versus Approved BTK Inhibitor Drugs in Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
This is a study for participants with a type of blood cancer called mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The main purpose is to compare pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305) to other drugs that work in a similar way that have already been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). Participation could last up to two years, and possibly longer, if the disease does not progress.
Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib|DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Zanubrutinib
To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Assessed per Lugano criteria, Up to approximately 24 months
To compare Event Free Survival (EFS) as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) treatment arms, Defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or start of new treatment for MCL or withdrawal from trial due to toxicity or death, Up to approximately 24 months|To compare Time to Treatment Failure (TTTF) as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) treatment arms, Time from randomization to time when discontinuation criteria met, Up to approximately 24 months|Time to worsening (TTW) of MCL-related symptoms, Using symptom questions identified from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) item library. The range of raw scores for these items could be from 0 to 52 with highest score being worse symptoms., Up to approximately 24 months|Comparative Tolerability as measured by proportion of time with high side effect burden, Using 18 items covering 10 Patient Reported Outcome- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) concepts for frequency (0-5 with 5 as most frequent), and/or presence (0-1 with 1 being present), or Severity (0-5 with 5 as most severe) and/or presence (0-1 with 1 being present); these selective adverse events will be framed and then overall side effect burden will be ascertained with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) - Item GP5. The range of this item is 0 -4 with 4 as most bothersome., Up to approximately 24 months|To compare Overall Response Rate (ORR) of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) treatment arms, Assessed per Lugano criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|To compare Duration of Response (DOR) of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) treatment arms, Assessed per Lugano criteria, Up to approximately 24 months|To compare Overall Survival of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy (Arm A) to investigator choice of covalent BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Arm B) treatment arms, Assessed by survival, Up to approximately 24 months
This is a Phase 3 global, randomized, open-label study comparing pirtobrutinib (Arm A) to investigator's choice of ibrutinib, acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib (Arm B) in MCL patients who have received 1 or more lines of therapy and are BTK inhibitor na√Øve.
