Fat Emulsion in Preventing Hypersensitivity Reactions in Patients With Cancer Receiving Carboplatin or Oxaliplatin
This randomized pilot trial studies how well fat emulsion works in preventing hypersensitivity reactions in patients with cancer receiving carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Giving lipids before chemotherapy may prevent some drug reactions from carboplatin or oxaliplatin.
Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Fat Emulsion|OTHER: Placebo
Time-to-carboplatin or Oxaliplatin Acute Hypersensitivity Reaction, The primary endpoint is the time to healthcare provider reported hypersensitivity reactions from either carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Kaplan Meier curves will be constructed and a log-rank test will be used to compare time-to-hypersensitivity reaction between treatment arms. Data will be censored based on last infusion with no hypersensitivity reaction with a maximum study treatment duration of 2 years per patient., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if the infusion of a lipid emulsion before each dose of chemotherapy appears to prevent carboplatin and oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reactions in high-risk patients.

II. To explore if lipid infusions modulate a well-established panel of mediators of hypersensitivity reactions and if these mediators appear to predict reactions.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Patients receive fat emulsion intravenously (IV) immediately before each dose of either carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

GROUP II: Patients receive placebo IV immediately before each dose of either carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
