Alternative Dosing Of Niraparib To Decrease Dose Interruption In First Line Maintenance Treatment For Ovarian Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test alternative dosing of niraparib in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade, advanced stage ovarian cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

What is the incidence of hematologic and other adverse events? What is the incidence of dose interruption, dose reduction and discontinuation? What is the length of time of progression-free survival at 24 months?

This is a single arm phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade, advanced stage ovarian cancer. Patients must have received a minimum of 4 cycles of front-line platinum-based chemotherapy with a complete response or partial response (no measurable lesion \>1 cm and normal cancer antigen (CA -25) after completion of chemotherapy) and primary or interval debulking surgery. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of hematologic and other adverse events and the incidence of dose interruption, dose reduction and discontinuation, and progression-free survival at 24 months with a niraparib dose escalation design. Study enrollment is planned to include 40 patients at one site.
