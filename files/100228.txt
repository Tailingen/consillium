Repeatability and Reproducibility of the ADC Map in Head and Neck Cancer. Prospective Multicenter Study
Evaluation of the repeatability and reproducibility of ADC maps in both primary and non-primary lesions lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer, using an acquisition protocol Standardized DWI
Head and Neck Carcinoma
Evaluation of the short-term repeatability of ADC maps in both primary and nodal lesions in patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck, A standardized and shared DWI acquisition protocol will be used at a multicenter level. DWI imaging consists of a spin-echo echo-planar (SE-EPI) sequence that will be acquired with 1.5 T or 3 T tomographs, setting the acquisition parameters, after the administration of the contrast medium (if any) (in order to ensure that the second DWI acquisition is performed under the same conditions as the first). The MRI study must include at least one T2-weighted axial sequence, whose images will be used to support the delineation of the lesions., 18 months
DWI imaging consists of a spin-echo echo-planar sequence (SE-EPI) that will be acquired with 1.5 T or 3 T tomographs according to the equipment of the individual centers involved, setting the acquisition parameters after the administration of any contrast medium.
