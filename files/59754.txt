A Study of OMP-336B11 in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of OMP-336B11. OMP-336B11 is an engineered human protein that was designed to bind to the GITR receptor on T cells and activate the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.
Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: OMP-336B11
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) will be determined in patients treated with OMP-336B11, Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Subjects will be assessed for DLTs through the end of the first cycle (Days 1-29)
Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (CL), Clearance (CL) will be evaluated, Screening through 12 weeks post treatment termination|Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (Vd), Volume of distribution (Vd) will be evaluated, Screening through 12 weeks post treatment termination|Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (T1/2), The half life (T1/2) of OMP-336B11 will be assessed, Screening through 12 weeks post treatment termination|Immunogenicity of OMP-336B11 (Percentage of patients with anti-336B11 antibodies), Percentage of patients with anti-336B11 antibodies assessed, up to approximately 2 years|Objective Response, Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), up to approximately 2 years|Progression-Free Survival, Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), up to approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, Phase 1a dose escalation study of OMP-336B11 administered as a single agent to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed for survival for up to approximately 2 years. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.
