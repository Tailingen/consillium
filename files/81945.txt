FLNA in HCC Patients
The risk of recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very high. Having a predictive marker of early recurrence (ER) would be desirable to personalize the follow-up and possibly develop new targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to test the expression of Filamin A (FLNA) in a cohort of patients operated for HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Rate of expression of Filamin A (FLNA) in HCC specimens from patients resected for HCC., The rate of expression of FLNA in HCC specimens will be measured using standard immunohistochemistry methodology on surgical specimens. Such expression rate will be correlated to several different clinical and pathological parameters., 2 years after surgery as a minimum follow-up
A consecutive cohort of resected HCC patients will be analyzed. Several different prognostic factors, including FLNA expression, will be tested against the risk of ER. FLNA expression will be analyzed with immunohistochemistry in the intra-tumoral and extra-tumoral tissue compartments using a dedicated tissue microarray.
