Vincristine-induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Adult Survivors of Childhood and Adolescent Leukemia
Vincristine is a major anticancer agent in the management of hematological malignancies. One of the main side effects is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is a characteristic side effect of neurotoxic anticancer drugs. CIPN associated with vincristine is typically characterized by distal and symmetrical sensory symptoms (dysesthesia and paresthesia). Motor and vegetative symptoms can also be found. The prevalence of CIPN associated with vincristine during treatment ranges from 12 to 100% in children (depending on the endpoint).

The aim of this cross-sectionnal study will be to explore the CIPN prevalence and severity in adult survivors of childhood leukemia and having been treated by vincristine.

Adult survivors of chidlhood leukemia and having been treated by vincristine will be contacted from the French childhood cancer survivor study for leukaemia (LEA Cohort) in order to seek their participation agreement.

Thereafter patients will received a self-administered questionnaire exploring the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and related comorbidities (pain, neuropathic pain, anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, substance use, physical activity, deprivation). Oncological and sociodemographic characteristics of participants will be recorded.
