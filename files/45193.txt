The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of plerixafor in combination with cemiplimab in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Plerixafor
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Using Immune RECIST (iRECIST) Criteria, ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 10 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions. Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity or clinical progression prior to post-baseline tumor assessments will be considered as non-responders., 10 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Grade 3 or Above Drug-related Toxicities, Defined using NCI CTCAE v5.0, 13 months
