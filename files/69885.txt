Role of Esophagectomy in Complete Responders to CCRT
To investigate the role of esophagectomy in complete responders to preoperative chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, patients will be randomized to either observation or esophagectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: esophagectomy
2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, 2 years from the enrollment of last patient
Overall survival (OS), 5 years from the enrollment of last patient|progression-free survival, 5 years from the enrollment of last patient|failure pattern, 5 years from the enrollment of last patient|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, up to 60 days after treatment|Comparison of clinical complete response (cCR) vs. pathologic complete response rate (pCR) in patients who underwent esophagectomy, 5 years|Comparison of OS according to clinical response (CR vs PR vs SD/PD) after preoperative chemoradiotherapy among those who underwent preplanned esophagectomy;, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Comparison of OS according to metabolic response after induction chemotherapy, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Quality of life, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Comparison of PFS according to clinical response (CR vs PR vs SD/PD) after preoperative chemoradiotherapy among those who underwent preplanned esophagectomy;, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Comparison of TTF according to clinical response (CR vs PR vs SD/PD) after preoperative chemoradiotherapy among those who underwent preplanned esophagectomy;, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Comparison of PFS according to metabolic response after induction chemotherapy, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|Comparison of TTF according to metabolic response after induction chemotherapy, 5 years from the enrollment of the last patient|treatment-related mortality, up to 60 days after completion of treatment
After completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, patients will be reassed and visited to multidisciplinary clinic, then, randomized to either observation or esophagectomy.
