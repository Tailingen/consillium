Evaluating the Impact of a 12-month Multi-Modal Lifestyle Management Intervention on Disease Relevant Biomarkers
A prospective, pilot study to assess the impact of a 12-month multi-focal lifestyle intervention on myeloma-relevant biomarkers in patients with MGUS or SM. The multimodal lifestyle intervention has six foci that patients will participate in over the course of one-year.
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance|Smoldering Myeloma
OTHER: The Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention
Efficacy of multi-modal lifestyle intervention based on any of the 3 specified myeloma tumor burden biomarker surrogates, Efficacy of the multi-modal lifestyle intervention will be based on measurements of 3 myeloma-relevant biomarkers: M-Spike Protein, Free kappa light chains, and Free lambda-light chains. We will first determine which monoclonal protein is dominant for a given patient based on his/her/their individual lab values. These labs will be taken at baseline and compared to levels at 4-, 8-, and 12-month intervals to assess for changes in protein levels., At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months
Patient Acceptability (engagement) of the Lifestyle Intervention, Patient acceptability will be measured by a patient acceptability questionnaire, At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months|Patient Adherence (compliance) to the Lifestyle Intervention, Patient adherence will be measured based on attendance at clinic visits, the various scheduled individual and group meetings across all intervention components, and via the use of wearable technology, At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months
Correlation between specified inflammation biomarkers and any of the 3 specified myeloma tumor burden biomarker surrogates, Inflammation will be measured using 3 surrogate markers: IL-6, TNF-alpha, and VEGF. These labs will be taken at baseline and compared to levels at 4-, 8-, and 12-month intervals to assess for a reduction in these levels and any observed correlation with myeloma markers, At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months|Correlation between patient glucose levels/changes and any of the 3 specified myeloma tumor burden biomarker surrogates, Fasting insulin levels and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements will be taken at baseline and compared to levels at 4-, 8-, and 12-month intervals to assess for improvements and any observed correlation with designated myeloma markers. Average of In-Range Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) recordings will be calculated at baseline and compared to levels at 4-, 8-, and 12-month intervals to assess for improvements and correlation with select myeloma biomarkers., At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months|Correlation between lipid-related biomarkers/changes and any of the 3 specified myeloma tumor burden biomarker surrogates, Body mass index (BMI), Abdominal Visceral Fat; High Density Lipoprotein - Cholesterol (HDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-1(APO A1), and Adiponectin will be measured at baseline and compared to levels at 4-, 8-, and 12-month intervals to assess for improvements and any correlation with the identified myeloma biomarkers, At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months|Validation of the PESSEN questionnaire, The PESSEN Questionnaire (Positive cognition, Emotional wellbeing, Social connection, Stress reduction, Exercise, Nutrition) is designed to assess a patient's overall lifestyle wellness as measured across six areas, assess the degree to which a patient believes that these six areas of lifestyle interventions can improve their cancer outcome, and to assign them a lifestyle wellness score., At study entry, 4 months, 8 months, and up to 12 months
Patients with a diagnosis of MGUS or SM who are willing and able to participate in this 12-month multimodal lifestyle approach. Eligible patients include those 18 years of age and older diagnosed with MGUS/SM, ECOG PS 0-2, absence of significant comorbidities, and ability to speak/read/understand English.

The multimodal lifestyle intervention has six foci: Positive cognition \[mindset\], Exercise/movement, Stress Reduction, Social Connection, Emotional Wellbeing, and Nutrition. All programming will take place online to maximize convenience/sustained participation.
