Complete Mesogastric Excision With D2 Lympadenectomy for Gastric Cancer:
Objective: To define complete mesogastric excision and compare our short term results for the first time in a different population.

Study design:Randomised-controlled study

Place and duration of the study: Gastroenterological Surgery Clinic,Health Sciences University,Basaksehir City Hospital,Istanbul,Turkey,from April to December 2023.

Methodology: We compared short term results of open total gastrectomy+ mesogastrectomy with standard total gastrectomy + D2 lymph node dissection at a tertiary center in terms of peroperative results, histopathological findings and postoperative short- term outcomes with review of the literature.

Conclusion: Our aim is to show that mesogastric excision is safe and has advantages over conventional D2 gastrectomy in means of not only peroperative and short-term outcomes, but also disease free survival.Our work is the first study from a different population of the world and our initial results can contribute to the literature for universalization.

PROCEDURE: Total mesogastrectomy
Postoperative outcome, Complications, Postoperative 1 week
The curative treatment of gastrointestinal tumors is surgery referring to an en block resection of the primary tumor along with its lymphovascular drainage.Unfortunately, despite of these radical resections, published literature shows that recurrences occur in up to 38% of patients in 5 years. Morover, these rates may reach to 60% in patients with locally advanced tumor following radical surgery. However, this mesentery-based surgery is harder to apply in gastric cancer due to differences in embriyological development. In our prospective study and a review of the literature, following the descripiton of mesogastrium concept, we aimed to search and analyse former techniques and viewpoints about mesogastric excision by different surgical approaches from various countries. Later, we aimed to show our technique of mesogastrectomy, compared our short term results with limited publications from the literature.
