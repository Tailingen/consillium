SDH of HPV Vaccine Completion
The purpose of this research study is to find out which factors influence parents' ability to complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series for their child. The information learned from this study may help the investigators develop programs to improve HPV vaccine completion rates among adolescents and reduce barriers to receiving the second shot of the vaccine series.
