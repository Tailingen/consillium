COffee and Metabolites Modulating the Gut MicrobiomE in Colorectal caNCER
This is research study is assessing the effects of 6-g daily use of freeze-dried instant coffee on liver fat and fibrosis and the gut microbiome and metabolome in patients who have completed routine treatment (including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) for stage I-III colorectal cancer.

Change in hepatic fat fraction., This will be assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at randomization and the end of the intervention: The investigators will assess the treatment effect using linear mixed effects model that includes time, group assignment, and the group-by-time interaction as the primary independent variables., 2 years after study completion
Change in liver fibrosis assessment and plasma levels of liver enzymes, This will be analyzed including the score assessed by the FibroScan® system, plasma liver enzymes, and fibrosis-4 index, at randomization and the end of the intervention: The investigators will assess the treatment effect using linear mixed effects model that includes time, group assignment, and the group-by-time interaction as the primary independent variables., 2 years after study completion
Change in the stool microbiome, Stool microbiome will be assessed by shotgun metagenome sequencing at randomization and the end of the intervention. The investigators will use the established computational tools developed by Dr. Huttenhower (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/biobakery) for the analysis, including LEfSe (Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size) and MaAsLin2 (Multivariate Analysis by Linear models)., 2 years after study completion|ctDNA analysis, ctDNA (binary; positive vs. negative) will be assessed after intervention according to methods appropriate for this exploratory analysis. The investigators will conduct an exploratory analysis with ctDNA to understand if effects are mediated through reducing circulating tumor cells. Tissue and post-treatment blood specimens will be prepared and sent to Natera Inc® for ctDNA assessment., 2 years after study completion|Change in stool metabolomics, Stool metabolomics will be assessed at randomization and the end of the intervention: The treatment effect on metabolites (log-transformed whenever needed) will be assessed by linear mixed effects model that includes time, group assignment, and the group-by-time interaction as the primary predictors., 2 years after study completion
This research study is a chemoprevention clinical trial, designed to test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The investigators plan to recruit 80 participants.

* Coffee is a complex mixture of hundreds of bioactive compounds, including caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and other polyphenols. Increasing data suggest the anti-cancer benefit of coffee. Observational data have linked coffee drinking to better survival among patients with colorectal cancer. However, there remains uncertainty surrounding the mode of action.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved coffee as a treatment for any disease.
* The research study procedures include:
* Screening for eligibility.
* Two study visits
* Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
* Magnetic resonance imaging
* Ultrasound elastography.
* Urine, blood, and stool samples collected.
* Diet and lifestyle questionnaires
* Collection of archival tumor biopsy tissue.
* Treatment: Coffee or placebo administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks.
