Sentinel Node With Ultrasound Contrast in Melanoma
The purpose is to evaluate,in 20 patients, if the sentinel node(s) in melanoma can be detected by lymph contrast ultrasound. In comparing the patients will also get lymph-scintigraphy and sentinel node detection wiht blue dye.

The goal is to improve the method for detecting sentinel node(s) in melanoma.
