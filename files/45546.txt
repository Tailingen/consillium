Characteristics of Intestinal Microbiome Following Pancreatic Surgery
The goal of this observational study is to learn about intestinal microbiome structure and function in individuals who have undergone a pancreatoduodenectomy and compare to healthy matched controls.

The primary objectives of the study are:

1. To explore and describe any differences in the gut microbiota especially Shannon diversity index
2. To conduct functional profiling by exploring and describing any differences in functional metabolites produced in the gut in people having had pancreatoduodenectomy greater than 6 months ago compared to healthy matched controls.

Participants will be asked to complete the following:

* Three-day food, bowel and medication diary (see Protocol appendix 5)
* Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (see Protocol appendix 6)
* Quality of life questionnaire (see Protocol appendix 7)
* Stool sample test using Microba Insight TradeMark (a small swab is taken from soiled toilet paper, sealed in a room-temperature storage capsule and mailed to the testing laboratory)

Comparison of microbiota profile between post-surgical participants and healthy controls., Stool samples will be analysed to compare the Shannon diversity index (calculated by taking the number of each microbial species, the proportion each species is of the total number of individuals, summed by the proportion times the natural log of the proportion for each species) between participant groups., During data collection, 3 days
Compliance with 3-day food dairies, Compliance with 3-day food dairies (completion rate of food diaries), From enrollment to the collection of data from participants, 3 days|Pre-paid return rates, Pre-paid return rates (proportion (number) of envelopes returned), From enrollment to the collection of data from participants, 3 days|Ease of matching, Ease of matching (ability to match surgical patients to controls based on age, gender, body mass index, smoking status), Enrollment period, up to 12 months|Shannon diversity index, Shannon diversity index (calculated by taking the number of each microbial species, the proportion each species is of the total number of individuals, summed by the proportion times the natural log of the proportion for each species), During data collection period, 3 days|Gastrointestinal symptoms, Gastrointestinal symptoms (total number of bowel motions), During data collection period, 3 days|Protein:fibre ratio of diet, Protein:fibre ratio of diet (average grams of protein consumed divided by grams of fibre consumed), During data collection period, 3 days
