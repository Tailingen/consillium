Subharmonic Imaging and Pressure Estimation for Monitoring Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a diagnostic accuracy study to evaluate if two novel ultrasound (US) techniques, quantitative 3D subharmonic imaging (SHI) and Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE), used with an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA), can track changes in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) angiogenesis and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), respectively, by studying women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before as well as with around 10% and 60% (in part 1) or 30% (in part 2) of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment delivered and after completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Results will be compared to MRI and pathology.

Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) After Treatment for Complete Responders, To evaluate the ability of SHAPE, used with Definity, to track changes in interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) by studying women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before as well as with around 10% and 30% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment delivered and comparing results to MRI and pathology., from baseline to completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, average of 6 months|Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) After Treatment for Partial Responders, To evaluate the ability of SHAPE, used with Definity, to track changes in interstititial fluid (IFP) by studying women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before as well as with around 10% 30% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment delivered and after completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment and comparing results to MRI and pathology., from baseline to completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Subharmonic Imaging (SHI) Depiction of Breast Cancer Angiogenesis for Complete Responders, To compare the 3D Subharmonic imaging (SHI) depiction of breast cancer angiogenesis in humans to CD31, an immunohistochemical predictor of angiogenesis., From baseline to after surgery|SHI Depiction of Breast Cancer Angiogenesis for Partial Responders, To compare the 3D SHI depiction of breast cancer angiogenesis in humans to CD31, an immunohistochemical predictor of angiogenesis., After surgery; on average 6 months
