a New Treatment of Newly Diagnosed IDH1 Mutation Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a single arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivosidenib+venetoclax+ azacitidine in adult Chinese subjects with newly diagnosed IDH1m AML.A total of approximately 42 China Nationwide subjects with newly diagnosed IDH1m AML will participate in the study.The primary endpoint of the study is the complete remission(CR) + CR with partial hematologic recovery(CRh) rate, and the key secondary endpoints are CR rate,event-free survival (EFS),overall survival (OS),the objective response rate (ORR).

CR + CRh rate, CR is defined as Bone marrow blasts \<5% and no Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count ≥100 × 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red blood cell transfusions.

CRh is defined as a CR with partial recovery of peripheral blood counts where absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \> 0.5 × 109/L \[500/µL\], and platelet count is \> 50 × 109/L \[50,000/µL\]., 1 year
CR rate, CR is defined as bone marrow blasts \< 5% and no Auer rods, absence of extramedullary disease, ANC ≥ 1.0 × 109/L \[1000/µL\], platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L \[100,000/µL\], and independence of RBC transfusions)., 1 year|EFS, Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) until treatment failure, relapse from remission, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Treatment failure is defined as failure to achieve CR by Week 24., 1 year|OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of C1D1 to the date of death due to any cause., 1 year|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the rate of CR, CRi (including complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery \[CRp\], PR, and MLFS., 1 year
CR + CRi (including CRp) rate, CR is defined as Bone marrow blasts \<5% and no Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count ≥100 × 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red blood cell transfusions.

CRi (including CRp) is defined as all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (ANC \<1.0 × 109/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts \<100 × 109/L \[100,000/µL\]; without platelet transfusion for at least 1 week prior to disease assessment)., 1 year|DOCR，DOCRh，DOR，DOCRi, DOCR, among subjects who achieved CR; DOCRh, among subjects who achieved CR or CRh; DOR, among subjects who achieved CR, CRi (including CRp), PR, and/or MLFS; and DOCRi, among subjects who achieved CR or CRi (including CRp).

MLFS is defined as bone marrow blasts \<5% and no Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required.

PR is defined as all hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5%-25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 1 year|TTCR，TTCRh，TTR，TTCRi, TTCR, among subjects who achieved CR; TTCRh, among subjects who achieved CR or CRh; TTR, among subjects who achieved CR, CRi (including CRp), PR, and/or MLFS; and TTCRi, among subjects who achieved CR or CRi (including CRp).

MLFS is defined as bone marrow blasts \<5% and no Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required.

PR is defined as all hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5%-25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 1 year|MRD negativity rate., To evaluate the measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity rate., 1 year
