Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of PLB1004 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a phase I, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1004, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: PLB1004
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., 2 years|DLTs of Orally Administered PLB1004, Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.00. DLT will be defined as any of the events specified in the protocol that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to therapy with study medications., 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Orally Administered PLB1004, The MTD is the highest dose level at which the participant tolerates treatment without dose-limiting toxicities., 28 days|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Orally Administered PLB1004, The RP2D is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or less. An RP2D less than the MTD may be chosen if aspects of tolerability or efficacy not encompassed by the MTD determination suggest utilizing a lower dose., 2 years
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of PLB1004, The AUC values are based on the plasma concentration-time profile of PLB1004. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of PLB1004., Up to approximately 28 days; Pre-dose and multiple time points post-dose|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of PLB1004, The Cmax values are based on the plasma concentration-time profile of PLB1004. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of PLB1004., Up to approximately 28 days; Pre-dose and multiple time points post-dose|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of PLB1004, The Tmax values are based on the plasma concentration-time profile of PLB1004. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of PLB1004., Up to approximately 28 days; Pre-dose and multiple time points post-dose|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1., 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of starting treatment until the first date at which the criteria for progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST 1.1 are met or death, whichever occurs first., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of starting treatment to date of death due to any cause., 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or SD after the initiation of study drug., 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented response of CR or PR to date of first documented progression or death according to RECIST 1.1., 3 years
The study includes a Dose-escalation Part and a Dose Expansion Part. The aim of the Dose-escalation Part is to estimate the MTD (if possible), identify the DLT (if possible) and the RP2D for PLB1004. The Dose Expansion Part is to further assess the clinical efficacy and safety of PLB1004.
