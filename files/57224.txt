Availability & Effect of Post-OP Ketorolac on Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-cancer effect of a pain medication called ketorolac (Toradol) on ovarian cancer cells in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity after surgery for ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.
Fallopian Tube Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
DRUG: Ketorolac
Measure levels of Ketorolac in peritoneal cavity, To determine the concentration of measurable levels of R and S- Ketorolac (and the percent racemic mixture) in the peritoneal cavity after intravenous (IV) administration in the post-operative patient after cytoreductive surgery., 24 hours
Measure effect of IV Ketorolac on ovarian cancer cell adhesion and migration, The secondary endpoint of this study is to determine the effect of IV ketorolac on cell adhesion and migration of ovarian cancer cells retrieved from the peritoneal cavity after cytoreductive surgery, Up to 48 hours
Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the seventh most common cause of cancer deaths in women across the globe. The majority of women, nearly 70%, will present with advanced stage disease that heralds a poor prognosis.

Despite aggressive treatment that still favors initial debulking surgery followed by a platinum and taxane based chemotherapy regimen, most patients relapse after achieving a complete clinical response.

Our group has shown that the ketorolac can inhibit gene activity which inhibits cell proliferation and migration.Ketorolac will be used in this study with the goal of producing specific inhibition of cell adhesion and migration in ovarian cancer cells retrieved within the peritoneal cavity after cytoreductive surgery.
