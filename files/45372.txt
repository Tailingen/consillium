Immunotherapy in Combination With Chemoradiation in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab Â± tremelimumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with advanced solid tumors

Number of subjects with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), From first dose of durvalumab until 28 days after completion of radiation therapy|Number of subjects with Adverse Events (AEs), From first dose of durvalumab up to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment
Progression-free survival (PFS), From first dose until the date of objective disease progression or death, in the absence of progression at 12, 18 and 24 months, up to 4 years.|Overall Survival (OS), From first dose until death due to any cause through study completion, up to 4 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Number (%) of patients with an overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., From first dose until disease progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, assessed up to 4 years.|Best objective response (BoR), The best response based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST 1.1 assessment or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST 1.1 progression., From first dose until disease progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, assessed up to 4 years.|Duration of response (DoR), Time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., From first dose until disease progression, or death, in the absence of progression, assessed up to 4 years.|Disease control rate (DCR), From first dose until disease progression, at 18 weeks and 48 weeks.|Disease-free survival (DFS), From first dose until disease progression or death, in the absence of progression at 12, 18 and 24 months, assessed up to 4 years.
This study will initially treat up to approximately 300 patients with advanced solid tumors at approximately 30 sites, worldwide. The study will be composed of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment phase (Part A) and an expansion phase (Part B).
