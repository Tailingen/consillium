A Real-world Study to Explore Recurrence/Metastases of the NSCLC Patients and the Impact Factors of Patient Survivals
The real-world study was designed to explore recurrence/metastases of the patients with non-small cell lung cancer as measured by patient survivals and the impact factors of patient survivals.

The trial was designed as a real-world observational study to recruit those patients with pathologically diagnosed early-phase non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were enrolled in the clinical form 2009 to 2017 and explore recurrence/metastases of the NSCLC patients as measured by patient survivals and the impact factors of patient survivals. The study data on patient demographic characteristics, tumor biological characteristics, and clinicla treatments were collected via a retrospectively review method for evaluation of patient survivals and the relevance of clinical characteristics of the patients and patient survivals.
