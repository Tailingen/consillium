Application of Single-Port Robot-Assisted Breast-Conserving Surgery Via Axillary Approach for Breast Cancer.
Evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-port robotic surgery in breast-conserving surgery, compare and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of single-port robotic surgery and open surgery in terms of complications, postoperative complications, perioperative recovery effects, and safety in breast cancer breast-conserving surgery, in order to select a more effective and safe surgical method. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will enter the research process, with surgery including SPr-breast-conserving surgery or open-breast-conserving surgery, and the choice of the two surgical methods is based on the patient's financial situation and the availability of equipment;
Invasive Breast Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: robot-surgery|PROCEDURE: traditional open surgry
The successful rate of breast-conserving surgery, Whether intraoperative frozen section biopsy of the surgical margins detects cancer cells; if it is negative after two or fewer attempts, then the breast-conserving surgery is considered successful., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 weeks

Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will enter the research process, with surgery including SPr-breast-conserving surgery or open-breast-conserving surgery, and the choice of the two surgical methods is based on the patient's financial situation and the availability of equipment; - Preoperative hospitalization period: Collect patient disease information (including mammography, breast ultrasound, breast enhanced MRI, etc.) - On the day of surgery: Record operating time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative complications, intraoperative adverse events, etc.; - Postoperative hospitalization period: Record postoperative complications (postoperative bleeding, necrosis of the flap or nipple-areola complex, subcutaneous emphysema, infection, capsule spasm, postoperative shoulder pain and discomfort, etc.), postoperative pain scores, postoperative pathological biopsy; - Postoperative hospital stay: Calculated from the day of surgery to the day of discharge; - 28 days postoperatively: Understand the complication rate and mortality rate within 28 days postoperatively; - 90 days postoperatively: Understand the complication rate and mortality rate within 90 days postoperatively; - 3-year disease-free survival period (calculated from the time of surgery to the last follow-up or recurrence and metastasis date, recurrence is defined as recurrence in the surgical area and distant metastasis); - 3-year overall survival rate (calculated from the time of surgery to the last follow-up or death).
