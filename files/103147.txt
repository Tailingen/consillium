Study of Sipuleucel-T With or Without Continuing New Hormonal Agents in Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This study is designed to test the hypothesis that using Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) in combination with new hormonal agents (NHA) (abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide) for the treatment of participants with asymptomatic metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and no visceral metastases would enhance the activation of antigen presenting cells (APC) by sipuleucel-T.

DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Sipuleucel-T
Cumulative APC Activation, Cumulative APC activation is calculated as the sum of APC activation across 0, 2, and 4 weeks, At Week 4
Time to PSA progression, PSA progression will be defined as the time from randomization to the first date of documented PSA progression based on the prostate cancer working group (PCWG) 3 criteria., Up to week 44|Radiographic Progression Free Survival, Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS) as assessed by conventional CT and bone scan, Up to week 44|IgG Responses, To evaluate increases in IgG levels after treatment, pre- and post treatment signal intensities from Luminex xMAP will be compared using a one-sided paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To evaluate whether the fold changes in IgG levels after treatment were higher in the NHA group than the without NHA group, the values from the two groups will be compared using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test., At week 14
