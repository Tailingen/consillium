High-Dose PEG-Intron Pharmacokinetic Study in Patients With Melanoma (Study P04831 AM2)
The purpose of this study is to establish the pharmacokinetics of PEG-Intron, administered at a dose of 6 μg/kg/week for 8 weeks (induction treatment), followed by a dose of 3 μg/kg/week for up to 252 weeks (maintenance treatment), in patients with high risk melanoma.
Melanoma
DRUG: PEG-Intron
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, AUC was defined as the actual body exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, Cmax was defined as observed maximum plasma concentration., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks|Average Concentration Within the Dosing Interval (Cavg) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, Cavg was defined as average plasma concentration., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, Cmin was defined as observed minimum plasma concentration., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks|Observed Time to Achieve Cmax (Tmax) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, Tmax was defined as time of maximum plasma concentration., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks|Apparent Clearance(CL/F) of PEG-Intron at 12 Weeks, CL/F was defined apparent clearance - the volume of plasma in the vascular compartment cleared of drug per unit of time and per kilogram of body weight by the processes of metabolism and excretion., Predose, and 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours postdose at 12 weeks
Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence or unfavorable and unintended sign in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product, biologic (at any dose), or medical device, whether or not considered related to the use of that product., Entire study duration (up to 5 years)
