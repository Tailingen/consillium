Relmacabtagene Autoleucel as First-Line Therapy for High-Risk Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the efficacy of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel in participants with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma.
B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Relmacabtagene Autoleucel|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Complete Response (CR) Rate Per the Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, Complete Response Rate (CRR): percentage of participants with CR \[complete metabolic response (CMR); complete radiological response (CRR)\]. CMR: positron emission tomography (PET) 5-point scale (5-PS) scores of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake ≤ mediastinum), 3 (uptake \> mediastinum but ≤ liver) with/without a residual mass); no new lesions; and no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow (BM). CRR: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter of lesion (LDi); no extralymphatic sites of disease; absent non-measured lesion (NMLs); organ enlargement regress to normal; no new sites; and bone marrow normal by morphology., up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per the Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, ORR: percentage of participants with CR \[CMR;CRR\] or PR \[partial metabolic response (PMR); partial radiologic response (PRR)\].CMR: PET 5PS scores of 1 (no uptake above background, 2 (uptake ≤ mediastinum), 3 (uptake \> mediastinum but ≤ liver) with/without a residual mass; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in BM. CRR:target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi;no extralymphatic sites of disease;absent NMLs;organ enlargement regress to normal;no new sites;bone marrow morphology normal. PMR:scores 4 (uptake moderately \> liver),5 (uptake markedly \> liver, new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass;no new lesions;responding disease at interim/residual disease at end of treatment (EOT).PRR: ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extra-nodal sites;absent/normal, regressed, but no increase of NMLs;spleen regressed by \> 50% in length beyond normal;no new sites., up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Duration of Response (DOR) Per the Lugano Classification, DOR is defined only for participants who experience an objective response after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion and is the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death from any cause. Objective response is defined in outcome measure (OM) 2., up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Event-Free Survival (EFS), First infusion date of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel to data cut off, up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per Lugano classification or death from any cause., up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion to the date of death from any cause., up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Types, frequency, and severity of adverse events and laboratory anomalies, Physiological parameter, up to 2 years after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Pharmacokinetic (PK)- Cmax of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel, Maximum observed concentration of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel in peripheral blood, up to 1 year after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Pharmacokinetic (PK)- Tmax of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel, Time to maximum concentration of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel in peripheral blood, up to 1 year after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|Pharmacokinetic (PK)- AUC of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel, Area under the concentration vs time curve of Relmacabtagene Autoleucel, up to 1 year after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|The concentration of Car-T cell, The concentration of Car-T cell in peripheral blood, up to 1 year after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion|The change of serum cytokines concentration, The change of serum cytokines(IL-2、IL-4、IL-6、IL-8、IL-10、IL-17A、IFN-γ、TNF-α、IFN-α) concentration after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion, up to 1 year after Relmacabtagene Autoleucel infusion
This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial, assessed the efficacy and safety of JWCAR029(relma-cel) as part of first-line therapy after an incomplete first-line treatment regimen of two cycles of chemoimmunotherapy. High-risk LBCL was defined by the dynamic risk assessment of interim PET2+, together with either double- or triple-hit lymphomas or high-intermediate- and high-risk IPI scores (≥3). All sujects will be followed for 2 years following JWCAR029 infusion.
