A Phase Ib/II Clinical Trial of LBL-007 Combined With Tislelizumab in the Treatment of Malignant Tumors
This trial is an open and multicenter phase Ib/II clinical study, which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity, and effectiveness.
Malignant Tumors
DRUG: LBL-007 Injection|DRUG: Tislelizumab Injection|DRUG: Cisplatin Injection|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride for Injection|DRUG: Docetaxel injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), refers to the percentage of study subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response, All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT is defined as toxicity during the DLT observation period (3 weeks after the first dose)., DLT is defined as toxicity during the DLT observation period. The duration of DLT observation period is from the first dose to 3 weeks after the first dose|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21days)
Cmax, Maximum serum concentration, All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects, All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR per RECIST 1.1 is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD)., All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Duration of Response(DOR), To measure duration of response, All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Tmax, After taking a single dose, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration, All subjects signed the informed consent form to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)
This is an open, multicenter Phase Ib/II clinical trial of LBL-007 combined with Tislelizumab in the treatment of malignant tumors，which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity, and effectiveness.

The study was divided into two phases: Phase Ib (Part A): Dose escalation and PK expansion; Phase II includes: Part B, Part C, Part D, Part E, Part F, Part G, Part H. Part B \~ Part H will be designed and conducted based on the safety , tolerability and PK analysis of the Part A Study Part, after RP2D is determined, will be used for Part B \~ Part H cohort. Approximately 250-490 subjects will be enrolled (Specific sample size shall be subject to actual occurrence)
