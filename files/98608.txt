A Phase 1 First-in-Human Study Evaluating AMG 900 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This first-in-human study of AMG 900 will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The dose escalation part of the study is aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability and PK of oral AMG 900 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Up to 50 subjects may be enrolled in dose escalation. The dose expansion part of the study will consist of 42 subjects in three taxane-resistant tumor types. The dose of AMG 900 will be dependent upon data from the dose escalation part of the study

Safety: subject incidence of adverse events, first-cycle DLTs and clinically significant changes in vital signs, weight, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests, 1 year|PK profile: AMG 900 PK parameters including, but not limited to, maximum observed concentration (Cmax), minimum observed concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve and, if feasible, half-life, 1 year|Change in levels of p-Histone H3 from baseline (part 1 - dose escalation only), 1 year|Response rate in each taxane-resistant tumor type assessed per RECIST guidelines (part 2 - dose expansion only), 1 year
Change in tumor volume from baseline measured by volumetric CT or MRI, 1 year|Tumor response measured by CT or MRI and assessed per RECIST guidelines, 1 year|Change from baseline in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) using 18FLT-PET/CT (part 2 - dose expansion only), 1 year
that G-CSF must be started at day 5, 1 day after the last day of AMG 900 and be continued until neutrophiles are \> 1000 or until day 12, meaning 2 days before the reinduction.
