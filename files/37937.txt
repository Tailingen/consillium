Study on the Anti-tumor Activity, Safety and Pharmacology of IPH2101 in Patients With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety and pharmacology of two dose regimens (0.2 and 2 mg/kg)of IPH2101 in patients with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.
Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: IPH2101
Rate of Patients Achieving an Objective Response, The primary end point is the rate of patients achieving an objective response (defined according to the International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria), including minimal response, (as derived from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria), achieved at any time until end of study and confirmed on two consecutive assessments at 4 weeks interval., from start to end of study (14 months)
Safety Assessment, adverse events, physical examination and biological changes during the whole clinical trial., Adverse events collected from screening visit (date of signature of Inform Consent Form) up to the End of Study, up to 14 months|Pharmacodynamics of IPH2101, biological activity of IPH2101 on KIR occupancy at End of Treatment, from start to end of study (14 months)|Secondary Anti-tumor Activity, * any change of M-protein in serum occurring during the study (\>25 percentage increase in level of serum M-protein)
* progression to active Multiple Myeloma

Definition of active Multiple Myeloma: Evidence of progression based on the IMWG criteria for progressive disease in myeloma and any one or more of the following felt related to the underlying clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder :

* Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions
* Hypercalcemia (\> 11mg/100ml)
* Decrease in hemoglobin of \> 2g/100ml
* Rise in serum creatinine by 2 mg/100ml or more, from start to end of study (14 months)
This is a randomized Phase II, open label, multi-centre study, with two independent arms.

Patients receive 6 injections of IPH2101, at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg (according to their randomization) administered over one hour infusion at four weeks intervals.

A patient whose disease achieves at least a minimal response to study treatment at any time during the initial period of 6 cycles can be treated with an additional period of treatment of 6 cycles.

Patients are followed 6 months after treatment completion or until a KIR occupancy level \< 30% (i.e if the time required for KIR desaturation was \> 6 months), whichever is longer.
