Diagnostic Performance of Breast Cancer Screening Second Reading Process Assisted by AI
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare, for the second reading of screening mammograms, the standard of care with an AI assisted scenario.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* will the experimental pathway be non-inferior to the standard pathway?
* will the experimental pathway be economically superior to the standard pathway?

Participants will receive screening mammograms, as part of the breast cancer screening program. Researchers will compare the interpretation made by the second reader in the standard pathway with the AI assisted interpretation made by a different reader in the experimental pathway.

All mammograms eligible for a second reading, and included in the study, go through 2 arms:

* Conventional second reading by a radiologist accredited to do second reading in France (L2 control arm),
* Second reading assisted by the AI (L2-AI experimental arm): mammograms will be read by the AI first and only if deemed suspicious, a radiologist accredited to do second reading in France will review them.

The most pejorative assessment among the two arms is used as the final decision: if both arms consider the mammogram as negative, the participant won't be recalled, if one arm consider the mammogram as positive, the participant will be called back for further examinations.

Clinical performances and economical impacts of both scenarii will be compared.
