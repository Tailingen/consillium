Plasma Vitamin and Homocysteine Levels and Thrombosis in Patients With Ph-negative MPNs
Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk for thrombosis. Thrombosis is more frequent in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) than the normal population. In this study, we investigated the thrombosis incidence, the effects of plasma homocysteine levels on thrombosis, and the correlations between folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine and homocysteine levels in MPNs, and to compare these results with the healthy controls.
Thrombosis
Thrombosis, at least 1 year
High Hcy level, 1 year
Death, 1 year
Thirty-one new or formerly diagnosed MPN patients who consecutively visitted our outpatient clinic, as well as 40 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study.
