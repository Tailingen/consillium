A Phase 1 Study of ARQ 197 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open label, single arm, dose escalation study of ARQ 197 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Cancer, Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: ARQ 197
Safety, tolerability, ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met
To evaluate pharmacodynamics of phosphorylated c-Met, total c-Met, apoptosis marker (TUNEL) and phosphorylated FAK in tumor tissue correlated with administration of ARQ 197., ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met|To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of ARQ 197., ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met|To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ARQ 197 with continuously twice daily oral dosing schedule., ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met
Patients will take ARQ 197 orally twice daily continuously at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. The ARQ 197 starting dose will be a total daily dose of 200 mg (100 mg bid). ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment is permitted. A treatment cycle is designed as four weeks (28 days) and will be repeated without therapy interruption.
