Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled on ECOG-2993 clinical trial.

GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: cytogenetic analysis|GENETIC: microarray analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Comprehensive view of microRNA expression by cytogenetic subgroup, 1 year|MicroRNA expression in relation to clinical outcome, 1 year|Differential microRNA expression between normal B-cells and progenitors compared to B-ALL, 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify microRNAs that behave as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vitro and in vivo.
* To examine if single microRNA or signatures of microRNA correspond to different clinical outcomes in cytogenetically distinct B-ALL groups.

OUTLINE: RNA from archived samples are analyzed for microRNA expression profile in vitro and in vivo.
