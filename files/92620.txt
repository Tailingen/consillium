Interleukin-12 Gene in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases Secondary to Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Inserting the interleukin-12 gene into a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-12 gene when injected into the tumors of patients with liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: adenovirus vector|BIOLOGICAL: interleukin-12 gene
safety measure, adverse event reporting, up to day 57|toxicity grading, toxicity will assessed from grades 0 to 4 as per common toxicity criteria, up to day 57
tumor response compared at four weeks to baseline, tumor masses enumerated and measured pre-treatment and 4 weeks after treatment and changes in the tumor calculated., baseline and four weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral adenoviral vector-delivered interleukin-12 gene in patients with liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer .
* Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.
