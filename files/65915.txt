Longitudinal Assessment of Genomic Alterations and Clonal Evolution in ALK-positive NSCLC (Galileo Project)
The scope of GALILEO project (Genomic ALteratIons and cLonal EvOlution in ALK+ NSCLC) is to explore the feasibility of genomic longitudinal evaluation for ALK+ NSCLC patients in Italian routine practice and provide a detailed overview of resistance mechanisms and clinical outcomes according to current standard treatments.
ALK Gene Mutation|NSCLC Stage IV|ALK Sensitizing Mutation
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Biopsy (tissue or liquid)
Percentage of patients with available NGS testing at diagnosis, Percentage of ALK+ patients with adeguate tissue for NGS after diagnosisc biopsy, 5 years|Percentage of patients with available NGS re-testing after progession (either tissue or ctDNA) to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-Inhibitor, Percentage of patients who obtenied successfull NGS post-progression testing after re-biopsy or liquid biopsy, 5 years
PFS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, Time from treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years, 5 years|PFS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, Time from treatment start to death for any cause, assesed up to 5 years, 5 years
PFS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, PFS to first-line, stratified according to ALK-rearrangement variants, Time from treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years|PFS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, PFS to first-line, stratified according to NGS-based mutational profiling, Time from treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years|OS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, OS to first-line, stratified according to ALK-rearrangement variants, Time from treatment start until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|OS to first-line treatment with II-III generation ALK-inhibitor, OS to first-line, stratified according to NGS-based mutation profiling, Time from treatment start until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Incidence of secondary resistance mutations (SNVs) after first line treatment, Percentage of patients with SNV-based resistance diagnosed by tissue or liquid biopsy, 5 years|PFS to lorlatinib according to secondary resistance mechanism, PFS to second-line lorlatinib, stratified according to type of resistance (SNV vs off-target), Time from treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
