Effects of Increased Physical Activity Before Thoracoabdominal Esophageal Surgery
Thoracoabdominal oesophageal resection for cancer is a procedure with high risks for complications, and patients' preoperative status is a crucial factor for outcome. There are only a few studies that evaluate the effect of preoperative intervention, including physical exercises and breathing exercises, after this type of surgery.

The aim of the study is therefore to evaluate the effect of a training intervention before resection of the oesophagus.

One hundred patients scheduled for oesophagus resection according to Ivor-Lewis from five different hospitals in Sweden will be included. The patients will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The training intervention starts directly after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are given and lasts until three months postoperatively.

Intervention includes increased physical activity, strength training and respiratory muscle training.

At inclusion and three months after discharge, the patients will undergo tests of physical function and lung function. In addition, they will fill in questionnaires concerning level of physical function, level of physical activity and quality of life. These questionnaires will also be answered one year after surgery.
