Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ONC1-0013B in Patients With Progressive Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a PhaseI, open-label study, Dose-Escalation Study, where tolerated doses will be escalated to the next doses with the safety, tolerability, and PK being evaluated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Tumor assessment and PSA values will be evaluated during the study as an additional point.
