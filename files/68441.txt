Safety and Efficacy of Doses of LEO 43204 Once Daily for Two Consecutive Days on Full Balding Scalp in Subjects With Actinic Keratosis
To identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose levels of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for two consecutive days and to evaluate efficacy of LEO 43204 in two doses after once daily treatment for two consecutive days compared to vehicle
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: LEO 43204|DRUG: Placebo
Part 1: Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), The number participants experiencing a DLT was used to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for 2 consecutive days.The MTD was defined as the highest dose level with less than 4 out of 12 participants experiencing a DLT.

A DLT was defined as:

* Erosion/ulceration Grade 4 on the Local Skin Response (LSR) scale
* Other clinically relevant signs or symptoms observed, which the International Co-ordinating Investigator judges to be counted as a DLT.

The Local Skin Responses consists of the following 6 categories: Erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration. Each individual LSR category are given a numeric grade of severity from 0-4. Grade 0 being no presence and Grade 4 being the highest grade of severity., From Day 1 up to and including Day 8|Part 2: Percent Reduction From Baseline in Actinic Keratosis (AK) Lesion Count, Percent reduction from baseline in clinically visible actinic keratosis lesions (AKs) in the selected treatment area., From baseline to Week 8
Part 2: Participants With Complete Clearance of AKs, Complete clearance of AKs at Week 8 was defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in AK count., From baseline to Week 8|Part 2: Participants With Partial Clearance of AKs, Partial clearance of AKs at Week 8 was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in AK count., From baseline to Week 8
