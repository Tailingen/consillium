Risk Factors for Residual Neoplasia After Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
Laterally Spreading Tumors (LST) are important precursosrs of invasive colorectal cancer. Endoscopic treatment has replaced surgery in most of the cases. Nevertheless, after conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (CER), Local Residual Neoplasia (LRN) is an issue. Therefore, endoscopic follow-up and treatment are necessary. To decrease its occurrence, the risk factors of LRN shoudl be identified. Thereafter, in high-risk patients, other modalities of initial treatment including Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) and surgical treatment, could be considered. The purpose of this prospective study is to identify risk factors associated with the presence of LRN after CER of LSTs.
Colorectal Cancer
Occurence of Local Residual Neoplasia (LRN), LRN was defined as a histologically confirmed neoplastic tissue in the biopsy samples obtained from post-resection scar during follow-up colonoscopy 3 months after endoscopic resection, 3 months
Evaluation of Selected Risk Factors for Local Residual Neoplasia (LRN), Evaluation of selected patient- and lesion-related risk factors associated with LRN (gender, age, lesion size, location, morphology, pit pattern, histology, type of resection, and others), 3 months
