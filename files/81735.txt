Safety and Efficacy Study of BCD-020 in Therapy of Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This international multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label study investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of BCD-020 (INN: rituximab, CJSC Biocad) versus MabThera® (INN: rituximab, F. Hoffmann La Roche, Ltd.) both administered as a monotherapy of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Patients were randomized to receive 375 mg/m² BCD-020 as intravenous infusion once a week for 4 weeks or MabThera® at the same regimen.
