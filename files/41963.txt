To compare overall survival of subjects with advanced HCC who have progressed on/after or are intolerant to Sorafenib and receive Brivanib plus best supportive care (BSC) to those receiving placebo plus BSC, computerized tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every six weeks until progression or death
To compare time to progression (TTP) (Investigator assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) for HCC criteria), 35 months|To compare the Independent Radiological Review Committee (IRRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) using modified RECIST for HCC criteria, 35 months|To assess duration of response, duration of disease control and time to response, 6 weeks|To assess safety profile of brivanib. Safety will be assessed by the number of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), periodic data monitoring committee (DMC) review, 35 months
