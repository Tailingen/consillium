Comparison of the Coughing Frequency of Remimazolam Total Intravenous Anesthesia Versus Inhalational Anesthesia
This study is a randomized controlled trial. Adult patients undergoing thyroidectomy under general anesthesia at Severance Hospital and Yonsei Cancer Center are included in tis study. For intervention group, patients receive anesthesia with total intravenous remimazolam, while for control group, patients receive anesthesia with inhalation anesthetic.

The primary end point of the study is to determine whether coughing during endotracheal tube extubation is less when anesthesia is maintained with intravenous remimazolam compared to inhalation anesthetics. The secondary end points are cough score (graded into 4 levels), frequency of reoperation due to postoperative bleeding, These include the frequency of hypertension during the extubation process and whether additional painkillers are used in the recovery room.
