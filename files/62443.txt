Ultrasound-Guided Erector Spinae Plan Block for Colorectal Surgery
Colorectal cancer is a common and lethal disease. It still remains the third most common cause of cancer death in women and the second leading cause of death in men. Pain control is an important direction of postoperative management in malignancy surgery. Inadequate pain control increases cardiac and respiratory complications in these critical patients. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a recently described regional anesthesia technique that blocks the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves and the sympathetic nerve fibers. While the ESP block has been shown to provide effective postoperative analgesia after thoracic, and abdominal surgeries.

Our aim in this study was to investigate bilateral thoracic ESP block for providing successful postoperative pain management following colorectal surgery.
