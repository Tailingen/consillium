WB-EMS and Individualized Nutritional Support in Gynecological Cancer Patients
This study evaluates the effects of a 12-week whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) training combined with individualized nutritional support on body composition, muscle strength and function, quality of life, fatigue and Inflammatory status on patients with gynecological cancer undergoing palliative anti-cancer Treatment. Furthermore, this study assesses the effect of this combined therapeutic approach within a 3 to 4-week pre-operative study Intervention on the period of hospitalization in gynecological patients undergoing curative anti-cancer Treatment.
