A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound)in Different Dose Regimens in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The aim of this study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of docetaxel for injection (albumin-bound) in different dose regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study will be conducted in two stages. The first stage (Stage I) is a dose-escalation study. A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients will receive the docetaxel for injection (albumin-bound) until disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, or other reasons for termination of the study. All dose-escalation decisions will be based on the safety data generated from the current highest dose group.

In the cohort-expansion study (Stage Ⅱ), patients with a potential to have better response to the study drug will be recruited. Patients will receive the docetaxel for injection (albumin-bound) at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and follow the treatment regimen established in Stage I.
