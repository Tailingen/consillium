genetic risk screening tool (GRST) questionnaire, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

* To identify 300 Black families, at least one individual per family, eligible for genetic testing using our validated simple genetic risk screening tool (GRST) 1, via collaboration with trusted community organizations. For individuals eligible for genetic testing, we will counsel them about genetic testing, including reviewing GRST results, explaining why they are eligible for genetic testing as part of standard-of-care, explaining what this entails, offering on-site or remote genetic testing, and explaining that they will be connected to a genetic counselor if they have a pathogenic mutation (PV) of a variant of unknown significance (VUS), including resources for family cascade genetic testing.
* To provide genetic testing to 150 Black individuals and families and provide genetic counseling and risk reduction resources to individuals with a PV or VUS, including cascade genetic testing for their family members.
