An Extension Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Ranibizumab in Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (Cohort 2)
This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in two cohorts. The first cohort (reported separately under FVF3426g, NCT00379795) enrolled subjects with primary or recurrent Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) who completed the treatment phase of a Genentech sponsored study (FVF2598g (NCT00056836), FVF2587g (NCT00061594), or FVF2428g (NCT00056823)). The second cohort (reported here) enrolled subjects with macular edema secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) who completed the 6-month treatment and 6-month observation phases (12 months total) of a Genentech sponsored study (FVF4165g (NCT00486018) or FVF4166g (NCT00485836)). Patients were enrolled within 14 days of completion of the previous study.
Macular Edema|Retinal Vein Occlusion
DRUG: Ranibizumab 0.5 mg
Number of Participants With Ocular Adverse Events in the Study Eye, Number of participants with: any ocular adverse events, ocular adverse events causing treatment discontinuation, ocular serious adverse events, intraocular inflammation and cataracts that occurred in the study eye.

Only adverse events that occurred during this extension study are reported. For subjects in the crossover groups who started their first ranibizumab injection in this extension study, adverse events that occurred prior to any ranibizumab injection were also excluded., Up to 24 months|Number of Participants With Non-ocular Adverse Events, Number of participants with non-ocular adverse events (not occurring in the eye) in the following categories: any adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation and death.

Only adverse events that occurred during this extension study are reported. For subjects in the crossover groups who started their first ranibizumab injection in this extension study, adverse events that occurred prior to any ranibizumab injection were also excluded.

Additional information about adverse events can be found in the adverse events section., Up to 24 months
Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Change from baseline in then BCVA was assessed by the number of letters a patient could read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Eye Chart at a Starting Test Distance of 4 Meters. An increase in the number of letters read indicates improvement in visual acuity., Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 6, 12, 18, and 24|Change From Baseline in Central Foveal Thickness at Month 6 and Month 12, Change from baseline in Central foveal (retinal) thickness was assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT was conducted at the study sites by personnel who were certified by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center., Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 6 and 12|Change From Baseline in Visual Function Composite Score, as Measured by the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25), NEI VFQ-25 is a 25 item questionnaire that assesses visual function and quality of life for a total possible score of 0 to 100. A higher score represents better functioning. The change from baseline is calculated at Month 12 and Month 24.

Participants are grouped according to the treatment they received in initial studies FVF4165g BRAVO (NCT00486018) and FVF4166g CRUISE (NCT00485836)., Baseline (Day 0 of extension study), Months 12 and 24
