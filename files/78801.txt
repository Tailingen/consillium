ABC-lung: Atezolizumab, Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy in EGFR-mutant Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
ETOP 15-19 ABC-lung is an international, multi-centre open-label, randomized phase II trial with two non-comparative parallel arms of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with carboplatin-paclitaxel (Arm A) or atezolizumab, bevacizumab and pemetrexed (Arm B) in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring EGFR mutations after failure of standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
EGFRmutant Stage IIIB/C or IV Non-squamous NSCLC
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months according to RECIST v1.1, The primary objective of this study is to explore the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC after failure of standard EGFR TKIs., 12 months from randomisation
Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0, To assess the safety and tolerability of the treatment., from the date of randomisation until 90 days after the last dose of protocol treatment|Overall survival, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause. Censoring will occur at the last follow-up date., through study completion, from the date of randomisation until death, including OS rate at 12 months.|Objective response, Objective response is defined as best overall response (CR or PR) across all assessment time-points according to RECIST v1.1, from randomisation until either the end of protocol treatment or the end of follow-up., From date of randomisation until date of treatment completion (until documented disease progression, death or any other causes), assessed up to 2 years.|Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Quality of life will be assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The key QoL outcome is the time to deterioration (TTD) in the QLQ-C30 global health status/global QoL., from baseline up to 12 months or until disease progression, whatever is first.|Quality of Life lung cancer-specific module (QLQ-LC13), Lung cancer associated symptoms will be measured by the lung cancer-specific module (QLQ-LC13)., from baseline up to 12 months or until disease progression, whatever is first.|Extra-cranial PFS, Extra-cranial progression-free-survival is the time from randomisation to documentation of disease progression outside the central nervous system (CNS) as per RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurred first., through study completion, from date of randomisation to documentation of PD outside the CNS, assessed up to 2 years|Intracranial PFS, Intracranial progression-free-survival is defined as the time from randomisation to first documented radiographic evidence of CNS progression. CNS progression is defined as progression due to newly developed CNS lesions and/or progression of pre-existing baseline CNS lesions., through study completion, from date of randomisation to first documented radiographic evidence of CNS progression, assessed up to 2 years.
