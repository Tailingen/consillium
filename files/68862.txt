Evaluation of Impact of Sandostatin® Injection Before Axillary Clearance on Lymphocele Formation
The lymphocele is the main early postoperative complication of axillary clearance for breast cancer patients with rates up to 85%.

The usual treatment consists of external drainage. However, this method increases the duration of hospitalization.

As a result, some practitioners have abandoned drainage, allowing for ambulatory surgery.

If this solution makes it possible to reduce the duration of the hospitalizations, it involves iterative punctures of the axillary hollow in case of lymphocele These punctures may be responsible for pain, hematoma or infection of the operative site.

To date, no method has proved superior in terms of decreasing the incidence of lymphocele postoperatively axillary clearance.

Octreotide (Sandostatin®) is a peptide, one of whose effects is to reduce the inflammation responsible for lymphoceles.

The aim of the study is to inject Sandostatin® before surgery, with the aim of reducing the incidence of seroma by 50% after axillary clearance
Breast Cancer|Lymphocele
PROCEDURE: Injection of sandostatine
A 50% decrease in the incidence of lymphocele (30% to 15% progression) following axillary clearance of patients operated for breast cancer (excluding mastectomy) pretreated with an injection of Sandostatin®., The frequency of occurrence of a lymphocele requiring at least one evacuation puncture., 6 months
Evaluation of the volume of the punctures, Determined by the volume of the punctures carried out, 6 months|Evaluation of the cost of this treatment, Determined by the data recovered from the Health Insurance, 6 months
