Safety of TKI258 in Advanced/Metastatic Melanoma Subjects
This study is an open-label, dose-escalating study to delineate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TKI258. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be performed on all subjects. The eligible subject population consists of subjects who have been diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no curative standard therapy exists.
Melanoma
DRUG: TKI258
Dose Expansion: Determine the maximum tolerated dose based on dose limiting toxicity of TKI258, end of dose escalation|Dose Expansion: Determine the plasma and whole blood pharmacokinetics of orally administered TKI258, PK run-in days 1 & 2, cycle 1 days 1, 8, 15, 16, 28, cycle 2 day 15, cycle 2+ day 28|Dose Escalation: Assess tumor response according to RECIST as measured by response rate and lack of early progressive disease (<=2 months), every 8 weeks
Assess the safety profile of TKI258 in this patient population, PK run in day 1 & 2, cycle 1 day 8, 15, 28, cycle 2+ day 15 & 28, end of study|Assess the effect of TKI258 on biomarkers in the blood, PK run day 1 & 2, cycle 1 day 2, 15, 28, cycle 2+ day 28, end of study|Assess biomarker changes in tumor/nevi biopsies and archival tumor tissues where accessible, pre- and post-treatment, baseline, cycle 1 day 15, end of study|Assess changes in tumor glucose metabolism/cell viability between pre- and post-treatment using [18F]-FDG-PET, baseline, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 2 day 28|Assess anti-angiogenic effects of TKI258 using DCE-MRI pre- and post-treatment, baseline, cycle 1 day 2 and cycle 2 day 28
