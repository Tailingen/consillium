Chemerin in Colorectal Cancer and Its Relationship With Diet Quality
To investigate the relationship between serum chemerin levels of individuals with colorectal cancer and systematic inflammatory response parameters such as C-reactive protein(CRP) and albumin, and to investigate the relationship of these biomarkers with dietary inflammatory index, phytochemical, anthropometric measurements, and dietary inflammatory index, which is calculated with the data obtained from the 24-hour food consumption record and food consumption frequency questionnaire. The aim of this study is to examine the relationships between the index and dietary antioxidant capacity and to compare them with those of healthy individuals.

Serum chemerin level, The blood obtained from individuals after 8-12 hours of fasting will be analyzed in duplicate with the enzyme-linked immunity test (ELISA) method from the serum obtained after centrifugation, in accordance with the manufacturer's kit protocols., 12 months|Body weight, The body weights of the individuals will be measured after 8-12 hours of fasting, using Omron BF511 brand bioelectrical impedance device, wearing light clothes without metal objects., 12 months|Body fat percentage, The body fat percentage of the individuals will be measured after 8-12 hours of fasting, using Omron BF511 brand bioelectrical impedance device, wearing light clothes without metal objects., 12 months|Body muscle percentage, The body muscle percentage of the individuals will be measured after 8-12 hours of fasting, using Omron BF511 brand bioelectrical impedance device, wearing light clothes without metal objects., 12 months|Visseral fat level, The visseral fat level of the individuals will be measured by using Omron BF511 brand bioelectrical impedance device while they are on an empty stomach and wearing light clothes without metal objects., 12 months|Serum albumin level, The blood obtained from individuals after 8-12 hours of fasting will be analyzed from the serum obtained after centrifugation, in duplicate using the Bromocresol Green-Dye binding method, in accordance with the manufacturer's kit protocols., 12 months|Serum C-reaktive protein (CRP), The blood obtained from individuals after 8-12 hours of fasting will be analyzed in duplicate with the immunoturbidimetric method from the serum obtained after centrifugation, in accordance with the manufacturer's kit protocols., 12 months|Body Mass Index (BMI), Body mass index (BMI) will be obtained by dividing the body weight (kg) by the square of the height in meters., 12 months|Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), The resting metabolic rate of the individuals will be measured by using Omron BF511 brand bioelectrical impedance device while they are on an empty stomach and wearing light clothes without metal objects., 12 months|Dietary Phytochemical Index (DPI), he "Phytochemical Index" method was used to calculate the total phytochemical intake from the diet. The ratio of the total amount of phytochemical rich foods in the diet in grams per day to the total food intake (g/day) will be calculated as follows. The amount of phytochemicals contained in each food will be obtained from the USDA database., 12 months|Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), The frequency of food consumption from the participants and the data to be obtained from the twenty-four hour retrospective food consumption record will be evaluated using the Computer Aided Nutrition Program Nutrition Information System (BeBIS 9.0). "Diet inflammatory index" will be calculated by multiplying the nutritional parameters obtained from the recordings with the "inflammatory effect score".The resulting values are summed to obtain the dietary inflammatory index (DII) score, which represents the inflammatory load of the individual's daily diet., 12 months|Dİetary Total Antioxidant Capacity (DTAC), Dietary total antioxidant capacity will be determined using the 'Antioxidant Food Database'. The FRAP value of that food will be calculated by multiplying the reported iron reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value for each food and the grams of the daily average consumed food. The total antioxidant capacity (TAK) of the diet will be calculated by summing the calculated FRAP values of all foods and expressed as mmol/100 g nutrient., 12 months
The research will be executed. with 52 adult individuals between the ages of 18-65 who applied to the Ankara City Hospital Oncology Hospital Medical Oncology outpatient clinic, newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer (except for Stage IV), and 52 healthy adult individuals without any chronic disease, matched for age, gender, and BMI. Individuals will be told about the study in detail and those who accept will be included in the study by signing an informed consent form. A data collection form containing health and demographic information will be applied to the participants; Then, after 8-12 hours of fasting, body composition analysis (body fat ratio, muscle ratio, visceral fat level, resting metabolic rate) will be performed with the Omron BF511, a body composition analysis scale that works with the bioelectrical impedance method, and within the scope of anthropometric measurements, body weight, height length, BMI measurements will be taken. Body mass index (BMI) will be obtained by dividing the body weight (kg) by the square of the height in meters. After 8-12 hours of fasting, 5 ml of venous blood will be taken from the participants by the nurses of the Medical Oncology Clinic, and the serum obtained after centrifugation will be analyzed in accordance with the manufacturer's kit protocols and in duplicate, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level will be analyzed by the immunoturbidimetric method and the albumin Bromocresol Green-Dye binding method, and chemerin level by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) method. Nutritional status of individuals will be evaluated with a 24-hour retrospective food consumption record and food consumption frequency questionnaire, and dietary inflammatory index, phytochemical index, and dietary antioxidant capacity will be calculated from the obtained records. In order to measure the inflammatory potential of the diet, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was developed based on the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of different dietary components on various inflammatory biomarkers. The "Phytochemical Index" method was used to calculate the total phytochemical intake from the diet. The total antioxidant capacity of the diet was calculated using data obtained from dietary intake records based on Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) methods.
