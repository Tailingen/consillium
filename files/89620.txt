Human Papillomavirus Infection and Related Anal Lesions in HIV-positive Men Who Have Sex With Men
Multicentric epidemiological non-comparative study in France characterising evolution of anal Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and related lesions and evaluating markers associated with the observed evolution.

Estimated enrolment: 500

Principal Outcomes

* Detection of high-grade cytological and histological anal lesions by high resolution anoscopy
* Spontaneous regression of high-grade anal lesions
* Detection of anal HPV infection

Intervention (procedure):

* Patient medical interview (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up visits and if applicable Month 6 and Month 18 control visits)
* Standard proctologic examination with digital rectal examination and 2 anal swabs (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up visits and if applicable Month 6 and Month 18 control visits)
* High resolution anoscopy (initial inclusion visit, Month 12 and Month 24 follow-up visits and if applicable Month 6 and Month 18 control visits)

Only if lesion suggestive of Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) detected during High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA):

- anal biopsy(ies) during HRA

Only if high-grade lesion:

- HRA biannually
