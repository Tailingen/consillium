RAD 1801: Pilot Study of Intra-Urethral Radiotransponder Beacon Guided Focal Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
This study offers focal therapy for prostate cancer by using an intra-urethral radiotransponder temporarily placed during radiotherapy. The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: 16 French Foley Catheter
Confirm the Feasibility of Focal Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) With Real Time Guidance by Intra-urethral Radiotransponder Beacons., Confirm the technical feasibility of using focal prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) instead of traditional treatment methods using a 16-french Foley catheter and real time guidance by intra-urethral radiotransponder beacons.Feasibility will be defined as the ability of the treatment to take place as planned., 2 years
Assess Early Efficacy, Clinically assess early efficacy for men receiving focal prostate SBRT for low and low-intermediate risk prostate cancer.Efficacy will be defined as the absence of biochemically detected (via PSA lab testing) prostate cancer or clinically detected prostate cancer, Within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy|Assess Late Toxicity, Clinically assess late toxicity for men receiving focal prostate SBRT for low and low-intermediate risk prostate cancer. Late toxicity (defined as toxicity occurring \>90 days after treatment) will be assessed with regular clinical exams and patient toxicity questionnaires., Within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy|Assess Quality of Life, Clinically assess quality of life for men receiving focal prostate SBRT for low and low-intermediate risk prostate cancer. Late quality of life will be assessed with regular clinical exams and patient quality of life questionnaires., Within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy
This study offers focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer by using an intra-urethral radiotransponder placed temporarily during each of the 5 radiotherapy treatments. The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time while also accessing early efficacy, late toxicity, and overall quality of life post-treatment. Patients will be followed for 24 months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
