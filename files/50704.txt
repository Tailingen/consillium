Study of the Risk of Pharyngocutaneous Fistula in a Population of Patients Undergoing Total Laryngectomy and Creation of a Score for Pre-operative Risk Stratification.
Multicenter retrospective study of a cohort of patients affected by laryngeal carcinoma and subjected to total laryngectomy surgery at the centers participating in the reference period and responding to inclusion criteria.
Laryngeal Cancer
Identification of risk factors, The primary objective of the project is the identification of pre-operative risk factors, 12 months
Stratify patients, The secondary objective is to construct a score to stratify patients according to the risk of developing PCF, 12 months
Evaluate the relative weight of each factor pre-operative risk, in order to build a score (fistula-score) to be able to stratify before surgery surgical total laryngectomy patients in low-risk and high-risk PCF pharyngocutaneous fistula.

Analyze and process data relating to a total of approximately 500 patients underwent, consecutively, total laryngectomy for malignant neoplasm of the larynx

The results obtained from the present study will allow patients to be stratified into low and high risk for PCF to undergo total laryngectomy, so as to reduce this surgical complication
