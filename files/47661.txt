Chemoradiotherapy HNSCC, Randomized Study, Docetaxel,Cisplatin, 5FU,Erbitux.
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that induction chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy plus Cetuximab will give better results than the validated treatment (chemoradiotherapy), for treatment of locoregional advanced head and neck cancers.
Squamous Cell Head and Neck Carcinoma
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: 5 fluorouracil|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Complete response rate of the treatment, measure of the tumor, by CT scan or MRI and endoscopy 2 years after the end of treatment
The second focus of this study is to compare Overall survival between the two arms . It is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Aftercare every six months, Date of death
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy+ carboplatin + 5FU) is a validated treatment for patients with locoregional advanced head and neck cancers.

This study evaluates the outcome of induction chemotherapy (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 FU) followed by radiation therapy + Erbitux for patients with head and neck carcinoma with almost one measurable lesion by RMI or CT scan.

We hope we can improve the progression free survival of 14% at two years .
