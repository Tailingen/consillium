A Study of AC676 for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC676 in participants with Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies. The main goals of the study are to:

* Identify the recommended dose of AC676 that can be given safely to participants
* Evaluate the safety profile of AC676
* Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AC676
* Evaluate the effectiveness of AC676
