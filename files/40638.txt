An Efficacy Study of Adjuvant Treatment With the Personalized Cancer Vaccine mRNA-4157 and Pembrolizumab in Participants With High-Risk Melanoma (KEYNOTE-942)
The purpose of this study is to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab improves recurrence free survival (RFS) compared to pembrolizumab alone in participants with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma and a high risk of recurrence.
Melanoma
DRUG: mRNA-4157|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Assessed Using Radiological Imaging, RFS is defined as the time between the date of first dose of pembrolizumab and the date of recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first., Up to 7 years
Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), Assessed Using Radiological Imaging, DMFS is defined as the time between the date of first dose of pembrolizumab and the date of the first distant metastasis or the date of death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first., Up to 7 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Baseline through 100 days after last mRNA-4157 dose or up to 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab, whichever is later (for mRNA-4157 and Pembrolizumab combination arm) and up to 90 days after last pembrolizumab dose (for Pembrolizumab only arm)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Due to AEs, Baseline through 100 days after last mRNA-4157 dose or up to 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab, whichever is later (for mRNA-4157 and Pembrolizumab combination arm) and up to 90 days after last pembrolizumab dose (for Pembrolizumab only arm)
The purpose of this study is to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab improves recurrence free survival (RFS) compared to pembrolizumab alone in participants with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma and a high risk of recurrence.
