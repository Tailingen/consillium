Clinical Evaluation of Opto-Acoustic Image Quality With the Gen 2 Imagio System
This study performs the first clinical evaluation of the Gen 2 Imagio System in a clinical setting to assess image quality with both the IUS ultrasound only probe and the OA/US (duplex probe).
Breast Cancer Stage
DEVICE: Imagio
Number of Participants With Imagio Image Sets Collected, Obtain ultrasound only probe images and OA/US (both gray scale and OA) probe images as measured by the receipt of image sets for each subject enrolled., Baseline|Number of Subjects With Completed Pathology Results, Provide breast pathology results per subject (except BI-RADS 1, 2 and 3 (as applicable)) if subject's study mass is biopsied, Baseline
1. Obtain ultrasound only probe images and duplex probe OA/US (both gray scale and OA) probe images. This includes doppler and elastography imaging with the gray scale only ultrasound probe and ultrasound mode of the duplex OA/US probe.
2. Provide breast and lymph node pathology results (except BI-RADS 1, 2 and 3 (as applicable))
