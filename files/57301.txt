Neoadjuvant Treatment With Nab-paclitaxel for Patients With Stage II and III Luminal Breast Cancer
Multicenter, open label, non-randomized phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant treatment of ER positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative patients amenable to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
The Residual Cancer Burden Grade III (RCB-III)., The RCB-III was reported, including a 95% confidence interval. The estimate of the RCB-III was calculated as follows:

Overall Response Rate = Number of patients with RCB-III / Intent to treat (ITT) population, After surgery, up to 4 months
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Objective Response was measured following the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria. For the purpose of this study a response is defined as the achievement of a complete or partial response measured by breast MRI.

Pathological complete response (pCR) was evaluated following the Symmans method at the time of the definitive surgery. For the purpose of this study RCB-0 was considered a pCR.

The pCR (RCB-0) rate (pCRR) was reported including a 95% confidence interval. The estimate of the pCR rate was calculated as follows by central laboratory:

pCR Rate = Number of patients with pCR / ITT population., After surgery, up to 4 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), The ORR was reported including a 95% confidence interval. The estimate of the ORR was determined according to RECIST 1.1 and measured by MRI and mammogram in patients treated with this regimen. ORR was calculated as follows:

Overall Response Rate = Number of Complete Responses (CRs), Partial Responses (PRs) / ITT population, After surgery, up to 4 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Mammogram, The ORR was reported including a 95% confidence interval. The estimate of the ORR was determined according to RECIST 1.1 and measured by MRI and mammogram in patients treated with this regimen. ORR was calculated as follows:

Overall Response Rate = Number of CRs, PRs / ITT population, After surgery, up to 4 months|Invasive Disease Free Survival (IDFS), IDFS was defined as the time (days) from the date of randomization until the date of objective recurrent disease (local, regional or distant), second primary invasive malignancy (breast or non-breast) or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have recurrent disease or second primary tumor, invasive disease-free survival will be censored at the last contact date. Ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) will not be considered an event for the purpose of this analysis., Up to 6 years|Rate of Conversion to Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS), The conversion from the initially planned mastectomy to BCS was reported including a 95% confidence interval. The estimate of the rate of conversion to BCS was calculated as follows:

BCS rate = Number of patients with BCS / Number of patients with initially planned mastectomy., After surgery, up to 4 months|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE), Incidence of adverse events by maximum CTCAE grade (v4.03; NCI 2010) that occur during the study treatment period or within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment, regardless of causality and according to the relationship to study drug as assessed by the investigator, were collected and evaluated., During treatment and until 30 days after the last dose of each patient study treatment|Ki67 in Pre-treatment Tumor Samples as Tumor Predictive Marker of Nab-paclitaxel Response, Ki67 was analysed by immunohistochemistry following the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists guidelines. The cut-off considered for Ki67 expression was 20% of positively stained tumor cells., Baseline visit|Caveolin-1 in Pre-treatment Tumor Samples as Tumor Predictive Marker of Nab-paclitaxel Response, Caveolin (Cav)-1 was evaluated in the stroma and its expression was categorized in low, moderate, or high (tertile). The high expression of Cav-1 was considered as positive., Baseline visit|Secreted Protein, Acidic, Cysteine-rich (SPARC) in Pre-treatment Tumor Samples as Tumor Predictive Marker of Nab-paclitaxel Response, SPARC was evaluated for both tumor and stroma. Its expression was categorized as negative when the intensity was absent-to-weak (1), or moderate (11)-to-strong (111) with a proportion of stained cells \<10%. Immunolabeling was positive if the intensity was moderate (11)-to-strong (111) and the extent of staining was 10%., Baseline visit|Molecular Tumor Subtypes According to St. Gallen Criteria 2013 in Pre-treatment Tumor Samples as Predictive Marker of Nab-paclitaxel Response, Molecular subtypes were classified according to St. Gallen criteria 2013 and Prat et al. into Luminal A (ER+, Progesterone Receptor (PgR) \>20%, Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 - (HER2), Ki67 \<14%), Luminal B1 (ER+, HER2-, PgR \>20% and/or Ki67 \<14%), Luminal B2 (ER+, HER2+, any PgR, any Ki67), TN (ER-, PgR-, HER2-), and HER2-enriched (ER-, PgR-, HER2+) subtypes., Baseline
The primary objective of the trial is to determine the percentage of patients with poor response \[residual cancer burden III (RCB-III) rate\] in contrast to good response \[residual cancer burden 0/I RCB-0/1\] measured by the Symmans criteria \[20\] at surgery, in patients with stage II-III luminal breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel.

The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the residual cancer burden grade III (RCB-III) after surgery.

The total number of patients to be included in this study is 78 patients.

The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be approximately 90 months (Including follow-ups)
