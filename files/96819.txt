Study of Activated Cytokine-induced Killer Armed With Bispecific Antibody for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase II Randomized comparison clinical trial of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced pancreatic cancer. And the aim of this research is to study the clinical efficacy and safety of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for pancreatic cancer.

Primary pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in China, immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising means of human against cancer. This is a phase II clinical trial of single- center, The investigators plan to recruit for 90 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer,and all patients are divided into three groups.one group will receive cryotherapy, one group will receive conventional therapyï¼Œand the rest one will receive mixed liquor of activated CIK and anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody together with cryotherapy.

The result of this study was statistic and analysed with the record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.
