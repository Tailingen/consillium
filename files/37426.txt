TF-antigen Targeting Molecular Probe for PET Imaging in Solid Tumors
The objective of the study is to construct a noninvasive approach using 124I-labeled monoclonal antibody radiotracer to detect the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF-antigen, CD176) expression of tumor lesions in patients with solid tumors and to identify patients benefiting from TF-antigen targeting treatment.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: 18-FDG
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, SUV is a semi-quantitative analysis index to describe the radioactive uptake of lesions, which has certain reference value for differentiating benign and malignant lesions. The uptake of the tracer （124I-hJAA-F11） in solid tumor lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 2 years
Analysis plan: 1. Recruit 3-5 participants to analyze preliminary pharmacokinetic/first-in-human dose (FIH), major organ distribution, and tumor uptake information via whole-body PET/CT imaging; 2. Recruit 20 participants to analyze in vivo safety and tumor targeting information; 3. Recruit all participants for a final summary.
