Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic HSCT From HLA Matched Related or Unrelated Donors for the Treatment of Low Grade B Cell Malignancies
A non-myeloablative treatment strategy and uniform selection criteria will enable patients with a variety of low grade B-Cell malignancies to attain long term disease control without unacceptably high treatment related mortality.

Non myeloablative transplant aims to achieve the immunological advantage of graft versus tumor effect as conventional myeloablative therapy without causing high treatment related toxicities. Non myeloablative transplant has been gaining wider acceptance as a way to achieve longer disease free and over all survival in patients with low grade B-cell malignancies, which otherwise is an incurable disease. Recent studies of non-myeloablative HSCT have demonstrated the powerful effect of graft versus leukemia alone against myeloma and other malignant B-cell malignancies if the transplant is performed for low grade, low volume disease.
