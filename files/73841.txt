A Prospective Study to Evaluate Peginterferon in Reducing the Incidence of HCC in CHB Patients
China's new cases and deaths of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rank first in the world. hepatocellular carcinoma is the third most morbid, second-most mortal malignancy in China. Up to 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients caused by HBV infection. Antiviral therapy can significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), hinder the progression of liver disease, and effectively control the disease. However, studies in recent years have found that long-term therapy with Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NAs) cannot completely eliminate the risk of liver cancer in patients with chronic hepatitis B. In addition, a number of retrospective studies at home and abroad have shown that compared with long-term oral NAs, peginterferon can significantly reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, there is limit prospective studies.

This multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial study is aim to evaluate the pegylated interferon alfa-2b injection in comparing to NAs in reducing the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, to provide evidences for new management and treatment strategy options for improving clinical outcomes for the chronic hepatitis B patients. About 267 chronic hepatitis patients with intermediate to high risk of liver cancer who are now receiving nucleoside therapy will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized into the peginterferon combined NAs group and the NAs monotherapy group at a ratio of 2:1. Level of HBsAg, proportion of patients with HBsAg clearance and seroconversion, incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma will be assessed.
