Study of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients in the US Receiving Standard-of-Care and Initiating an Approved Therapy With Risk of Pneumonitis/ILD
This is an observational, prospective, multicenter study conducted in the US to gather evidence in the context of lung cancer to complement the development of a digital solution.

Patients initiating treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be prospectively followed to characterize risk factors, signs, and symptoms leading to onset, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumonitis/ILD should it occur.

This is an observational, prospective, multicenter study conducted in the US to gather evidence in the context of lung cancer to complement the development of a digital solution.

Data will be collected prospectively from study sites using eCRFs and remotely from patients using a digital health tool.
