DepoCyt Therapy in Patients With Neoplastic Meningitis From Lymphoma or a Solid Tumor
The purpose of this study is to find out how well an experimental drug called DepoCyt works for neoplastic meningitis (cancer that has spread to the tissues around the brain and spinal cord). DepoCyt is a new slow-release form of the cancer drug called ara-C (cytarabine). Cytarabine has been used for many years to treat cancer.
