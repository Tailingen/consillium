ACTEMRA® for the Treatment of Pediatric Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma
ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) is an IL-6 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of adult Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as Polyarticular (PJIA) and Systemic (SJIA) Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. In this Phase II, the drug will be used to treat pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma including patients who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy.

Sustained objective response rate of patients with recurrent/progressive previously irradiated ACP to treatment with systemic tocilizumab, To calculate the number of patients who experience sustained objective response rate \[minor response (MR) + partial response (PR) + complete response (CR)\] of patients with recurrent/progressive previously irradiated Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma to treatment with systemic tocilizumab (Stratum 1)., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|Sustained objective response rate of patients with measurable ACP who have undergone surgery but have not been previously treated with radiation to treatment with systemic tocilizumab, To calculate the number of patients who experience sustained objective response rate (MR + PR + CR) of patients with measurable Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma who have undergone surgery but have not been previously treated with radiation to treatment with systemic tocilizumab (Stratum 2)., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment
Biological effects of tocilizumab on ACP tumor tissue and cyst fluid., To measure the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CXCL1, CXCR2, IDO-1 and IL-6R using a combination of ELISA, RNAseq, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in cyst fluid or tumor tissue or blood. Comparisons will be made with known levels in the literature and among patient samples from within the study., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|Toxicities associated with tocilizumab in children with ACP, To calculate the number of participants with, as well as frequency and severity of, tocilizumab-related Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 in children with recurrent or refractory ACP., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|PFS of ACP patients treated with tocilizumab after radiation, To assess one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for patients with ACP who are treated with tocilizumab following progression after radiation (Stratum 1)., 12 months|PFS of ACP patients treated with tocilizumab who have not received radiation, To assess one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for patients with ACP who are treated with tocilizumab who have not previously received radiation (Stratum 2)., 12 months
Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly debilitating pediatric brain tumor that lacks medical anti-tumor therapies. Current therapy, which depends largely on surgery and radiation, is associated with poor quality of life and becomes more challenging and risky in the setting of recurrent disease. Recent discoveries regarding the biological characteristics of ACP indicate that available agents, including IL-6 pathway blockers may have efficacy in the control of ACP. We hypothesize that the IL6- receptor antagonist ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) will be safe and effective at inducing tumor response in children with residual ACP.

In this study, up to 38 patients will receive tocilizumab at the dose approved for pediatric Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (\< 30 kg: 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; ≥30 kg: 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks). Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 cycles).

It will be a multi-center Phase 2 trial with two strata for patients aged \>1 year and \<25 years with unresectable ACP who may have been previously treated with radiation (Stratum 1, 18 patients) or without radiation (Stratum 2, 18 patients).
