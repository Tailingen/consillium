Molecular and Genetic Analysis of Lung Cancer
Investigators use a genome-wide approach within a case-control design to identify SNPs that show evidence of association with lung cancer risk and survival.
Lung Cancer
Survival among patients at different stages of lung cancer and treatment will be measured using questionnaires along with medical chart data to monitor treatment and disease progression, Study lung cancer development in a case control study. We will look at three separate outcome measures specified below, 20 years
Overall survival, Measurement from time of diagnosis to death will be obtained, 20 years|Progression-free survival, Time of diagnosis to disease progression (measured by metastasis), 20 years|Treatment toxicities, Effects on ECOG and physical sequelae from treatment (radiation, chemotherapy and other treatment modalities will be analyzed), 20 years
Investigators also investigate how genetic variants may affect cancer treatment, at various stages of disease development, in order to determine prognostic and predictive factors for survival.
