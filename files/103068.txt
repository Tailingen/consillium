Stereotactic Radiotherapy With Different Fractionation Modes for the Early Lung Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to study the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with different fractionation modes for early lung cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

How effective are different regimens of SBRT for early lung cancer? How safe are different regimens of SBRT of SBRT for early lung cancer?

The goal of this observational study is to study the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with different fractionation modes for early lung cancer.. This study intends to review the patients with early lung cancer receiving SBRT of 30Gy/1f or 36Gy/3f from 2018 to 2024 in our center.
