PRONTO Trial (PRophylactic Versus ON-demand Use of TOcilizumab)
Despite the consequent use of Tocilizumab together with conventional antipyretics at early/first signs of emerging CRS, CRS (and eventually the subsequent development of ICANS) remain a major concern for patients.

This study aims to identify safety and efficacy of prophylactic Tocilizumab treatment. In particular, to explore whether prophylactic Tocilizumab treatment can decrease the incidence and severity of CRS (and subsequent eventual neurotoxicity) following CAR-T-treatment.

Adoptive immunotherapy with CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19) targeting chimeric antigen-receptor (CAR-)T cells is an effective therapeutic strategy against relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas, B-ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and myeloma. Currently, up to 50 commercial CAR-T-cell treatments are performed annually at the Inselspital in Bern, making it by far the largest center for CAR-T cell treatment in Switzerland.

CAR-T treatment is associated with well-described acute adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, termed immune effector cell associated neurologic syndrome (ICANS). CRS (at all grades) occurs in between 42 to 93% of all patients with variations among available products, and ICANS can occur (at all grades) in 21% up to 64%.

Acute complications of CAR-T cell therapy are the result of rapid CAR-T cell expansion and of a hyper-inflammatory state related to cell activation. Interleukin (IL-6) is a central mediator of cytokine-responses in CRS and ICANS together with other cytokines and chemokines involved. IL-6 interacts with its receptor (IL-6R) in either membrane-bound form, leading to "classic" IL-6 signaling after interacting with GP130, or soluble in plasma, where the IL-6 / IL-6R complex interacts with GP130 expressing cells in "trans" IL-6 signaling.

Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-6R in both its soluble and membrane-bound forms. Tocilizumab treatment has become the standard of care for patients presenting with CRS (at all grades), together with antipyretic treatment (grades 1 or 2 at the regular ward) or with vasoactive and/or ventilation support at the intensive care unit (grades 3 and 4).

The study aims to assess the incidence of CRS of all grades, as well as the incidence of ICANS of all grades, the duration of hospitalisation and the need of platelet and erythrocyte transfusion within the first three months after CAR-T treatment in patients receiving prophylactic Tocilizumab compared to patients receiving on-demand Tocilizumab.
