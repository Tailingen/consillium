Survivorship Study of Cancer Patients Who Received Cranial Radiation Therapy
This study represents a survivorship protocol that focuses on cognition and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in cancer patients that have received prior brain irradiation. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a digital symptom tracking application focused on HRQoL and cognition in cancer survivors who received brain irradiation.
Brain Metastases, Adult|Primary Brain Tumor|Lung Cancer
OTHER: Noona® application
Feasibility of using a digital symptom tracking application focused on HRQoL and cognition in cancer survivors who received brain irradiation, The percentage of patients returning for their Week 15 clinic appointment who initiate PROMIS and ESAS questionnaires via the mobile application at Week 14, Baseline, 15 weeks
Patients who may participate in the study are cancer survivors who received cranial irradiation for conditions including, but not limited to: primary brain tumors, brain metastases, patients with lung cancer receiving prophylactic brain irradiation, and long-term survivors of pediatric cancers. Patients will use the Noona® Healthcare Mobile PRO Application to identify real time select HRQoL and cognitive symptoms. Patients will be instructed to log symptoms as often as relevant using their own personal devices, as well as be prompted to fill out the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Screen (PROMIS Global Health-10 and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) during treatment (weeks 9 and 14). Patient engagement with the application will be tracked to determine feasibility.
