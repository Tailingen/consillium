DRUG: letrozole
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the time to progression of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer treated with letrozole (Femara) as first-line therapy. II. Determine the objective response rate, time to treatment failure, survival rate, and changes in symptom distress in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time to diagnosis of metastatic disease. Patients receive oral letrozole (Femara) daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients will be accrued for this study.
