Cognitive status, mood, quality of life, At recruitment and after 8 weeks
Patients (n = 60) will be randomized to an exercise or a control group. The randomization will be stratified for allogeneic or autologous blood stem cell transplantation. Patients in the exercise group will carry out an endurance training consisting of walking on a treadmill at a speed corresponding to 80% of the maximum heart rate. The exercise program will be carried out 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. Patients in the control group will receive counseling about exercise and behavioural techniques to reduce fatigue, but they will not participate at a structured exercise program. Physical performance (VO2max), cognitive function, mood and quality of life will be evaluated at recruitment and after 8 weeks.
