BIOLOGICAL: MYL-1401H|BIOLOGICAL: Neulasta
Mean Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN), defined as consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 Ã— 109/L, Cycle 1 of chemotherapy (approx 21 days)

Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs), Rate of FN listed by cycles and across cycles, Week 24|Presence of antibodies against MYL-1401H and Pegfilgrastim, Week 24
After successful screening, eligible patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms, either receiving MYL-1401H or Neulasta.

Randomization is 2:1 to MYL-1401H or Neulasta, respectively.

Subjects will receive first of six cycles of background therapy (Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide \[TAC\]) on day 1. Treatment with study drug (either MYL-1401H or Neulasta) is scheduled on Day 2 of each cycle, at least 24 hours after chemotherapy administration.

Duration of each cycle is 3 weeks.

Follow-up visit is scheduled 24 weeks after the first administration of study drug.
