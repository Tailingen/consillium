Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer
This study will evaluate the local control rate as well as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of organ confined prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: stereotactic body radiotherapy
Biochemical Control Rate, Serial blood tests for prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels will be obtained at regular intervals (every 3 months).The "Phoenix definition" for biochemical recurrence (nadir + 2 ng/ml) will be used. Biochemical control rate will be expressed based on subjects experiencing tumor control (complete, partial, or stable) vs. subjects experiencing disease progression., one year
Late Toxicity Rate, Toxicity will be recorded as a measure of patients who experienced adverse events within 1 year of study treatment., one year
This is a single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial of patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. Data collected will include patient demographics, pathology data, tumor stage, SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by adjacent critical normal tissues,tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities. Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated duration of this study is 5 years.
