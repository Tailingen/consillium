MB-CART20.1 Melanoma
This is a phase l multi-centric, single arm, prospective, open, dose-escalation study in patients with unresectable stage III oder IV melanoma. The trial will include 15 adult patients. The trial is a classic 3+3 design with 1 Log dose increments and maximum 3 dose levels of the intravenously administered MB-CART20.1.
Melanoma (Skin)
BIOLOGICAL: MB-CART20.1
Determination of MTD, MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which \< 33% of patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Week 4 after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Safety and Toxicity Assessment per Adverse Event reporting classified according to CTCAE V5.0, per Adverse Event reporting classified according to CTCAE V5.0, until day 28 after infusion of MB-CART20.1
Clinical Response, Number of patients with either Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease or Progressive Disease using RECIST 1.1, 1 year after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Frequency of B-cell aplasia, Circulating B cell numbers in the peripheral blood will be assessed by Flow cytometry, 1 year after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Phenotype and Persistence of infused MB-CART20.1, Blood samples for determination of persistence/phenotyping of infused MB-CART20.1 will be analysed., 1 year after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Presence and phenotype of MB-CART20.1 and B cells in biopsies, Tumor biopsies for determination of persistence/phenotyping of infused MB-CART20.1 will be analysed, Screening, 8 weeks after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Number of CD20+ tumor cells, Tumor biopsies for determination of number of CD20+ tumor cells, Screening, 8 weeks after infusion of MB-CART20.1|Persistence of T-cell expansion for each dose group, Blood samples for determination MB-CART20.1 levels (transgene copies / genomic DNA), Day 0 and week 12
This Phase I trial will be the first trial with CD20 CAR transduced T cells in Europe targeting melanoma. The rationale for the trial is based on the finding that melanoma cancer sustaining cells express CD20 and that targeting CD20+ cells in preclinical model has a strong antitumor effect.
