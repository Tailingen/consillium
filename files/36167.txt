PET-guided Radiotherapy for Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer.
There is a prospective risk-adapted evaluation of the optimal dose of radiotherapy for definitive radiotherapy of locally advanced small cell lung cancer within the corridor recommended as standard therapy according to the current interdisciplinary S3 guideline of the German Cancer Society/Cancer Aid/AWMF

The main objective of this study is to determine whether patients with SCLC who have a metabolically active residual tumor in the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scan after two to three cycles of induction chemotherapy have a similarly low local recurrence rate with higher dose. There is a prospective risk-adapted evaluation of the optimal dose of radiotherapy for definitive radiotherapy of locally advanced small cell lung cancer within the corridor recommended as standard therapy according to the current interdisciplinary S3 guideline of the German Cancer Society/Cancer Aid/AWMF. Allocation to PET boost, if confirmed vital tumor rest by PET CT and biopsy.
