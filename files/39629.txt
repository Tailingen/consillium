A Study of ERAS-0015 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The main purpose of the study is to assess whether the study drug, ERAS-0015, is safe and tolerable when administered to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with certain RAS mutations. ERAS-0015 will be given alone or in combination with other treatments.

This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter clinical study of ERAS-0015 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. The study will commence with dose optimization of ERAS-0015 monotherapy, followed by dose optimization of ERAS-0015 in combination with other cancer therapies.
