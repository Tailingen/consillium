Study of αPD1-MSLN-CAR T Cells to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Effectiveness for Patients With MSLN-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 nanobodies (αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells) in patients with solid tumors.
