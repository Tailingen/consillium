Interest of the Addition of Docetaxel to Standard Treatment in First-line Advanced HER2 Positive Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma in Selective Patients
The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of trastuzumab + chemotherapies with or without taxanes among HER2-positive advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients.

Progression free survival, PFS will be defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of first progression (local, regional, metastatic, second cancer) or death regardless of the cause. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the time of the latest news, up to 12 years
Overall survival, OS will be calculated between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. . Alive patients or lost to follow-up at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up., up to 12 years|Objective Response Rate, Evaluated by RECIST criteria version 1.1, up to 12 years|disease control rate, up to 12 years|secondary resectability of primary tumor or metastases in patients with DCR, up to 12 years|Tolerance, graded according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI-CTCAE\] criteria v4.03, up to 12 years
Studies have reported a beneficial role of trastuzumab combined to platin-5-FU based chemotherapy in first-line advanced HER2 positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the effect of taxanes combined with platin-5FU + trastuzumab (TPFT) is understudied.

In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of trastuzumab + chemotherapies with or without taxanes among HER2-positive advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients.
