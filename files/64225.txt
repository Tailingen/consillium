Prevention of Capsular Contracture Using Trental and Vitamin E
The main purpose of this research study is to determine if the use of Trental and Vitamin E will decrease the incidence and severity of contractures (shrinking and or hardening of tissue surrounding the implant) associated with breast implant reconstruction following radiation treatment. Another goal is to find out the impact that Trental and Vitamin E have on implant loss or need for surgical intervention in the setting of chest wall radiation after reconstruction. In addition, the investigators want to evaluate the patient's sense of well being and quality of life.
Capsular Contractures
DRUG: Trental
Measure number and grade of contractures occurring after implant reconstruction and radiation treatment in subjects receiving Trental and vitamin E combination compared to placebo using the Bakers grade assessment, 6 months
Number of implant revisions or loss of implants due to post radiation changes in subject receiving Trental and vitamin E compared to placebo through patient interview with research staff, 6 months
This is a single center, 18-month study in which 30 women will receive Trental (pentoxifylline) 400 milligrams three times a day in combination with vitamin E, 400 international units orally twice daily for six months. Subjects will begin the treatment regimen within four weeks after completion of radiation treatment and will remain on the study drugs for six months. Following completion of active treatment, all subjects will enter the twelve-month observational phase of the trial in which they will be evaluated for changes in breast tissue using the following objective tools: Bakers Grade Assessment, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), implant revision or loss, breast photographs, adverse event assessment and the Quality of Life tool (SF-12).
