Anlotinib Combined With PD-1 Inhibitors for Advanced/Metastatic Esophageal Cancer
Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors as 2 or more lines treatment for Heavily Pretreated Patients With Advanced, Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus.
Esophageal Cancer
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease progression or death from any cause, 6 months
Adverse Events, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 30 day safety follow-up visit|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1) and the percentage of patients who achieved CR, PR and SD was defined as disease control rate (DCR)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is calculated from diagnosis to death or last follow-up time, 12 months
The APEC study is a multi-center, retrospective ,real-world study of anlotinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors for patients with histologically confirmed advanced and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) that progressed after 1or more lines of therapy, conducted at 8 sites in China. Patients received anlotinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors , every 3 weeks for up to 2 years, until progression of disease, unacceptable toxic effects occurred, or withdrawal of consent. The primary end point was the progression-free survival (PFS)among all patients. Secondary end points included Adverse events (AEs),objective response rate (ORR) ,duration of response (DOR), , and overall survival (OS). Tumor response was assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.
