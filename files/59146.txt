Azacitidine in Patients Undergoing Matched Unrelated Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this phase I/II study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of 5-AzaC and the effect on grade II-IV GvHD when given after matched unrelated donor transplant (MUD).
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma
DRUG: Azacitidine
Phase I: to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Azacitidine in Patients Undergoing Matched (8 Out of 8) Unrelated Donor Transplant for Any Hematological Malignancy in Remission or With Stable Disease., The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity., 28 days|Phase II: Number of Participants With Grades II-IV Acute GvHD, GVHD rate and severity will be assessed based on modified Glucksberg criteria. Grade II-IV and III-IV aGVHD in first 180 days after transplant will be assessed., Day +180
Rate of Grades III-IV aGVHD at Day +180., GVHD rate and severity will be assessed based on modified Glucksberg criteria., Day +180|Overall Survival as Measured by Number of Participants Alive at 1 Year After Transplant, Date of transplant to the date of death from any cause., One year after transplant|Treatment-related Mortality, Death that results from a transplant procedure-related complication (e.g. infection, organ failure, hemorrhage, GVHD) rather than from relapse of the underlying disease or an unrelated cause., Day +140|Number of Participants Who Relapsed Within the First Year of Transplant, Recurrence of the original malignant disease after transplantation. The time to relapse is the time to the first observation of hematologic, radiographic, or cytogenetic changes, which result in characterization as relapse., Within the first year of transplant|Rate of Chronic GvHD, One year after transplant
The purpose of this phase I/II study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of 5-AzaC and the effect on grade II-IV GvHD when given after matched unrelated donor transplant (MUD).
