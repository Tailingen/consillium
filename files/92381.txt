Assessment of the Minimal Residual Disease in DLBCL From Cell-free Circulating DNA by NGS
This is a prospective descriptive monocentric study whose purpose is to describe the clonal evolution of the mutational pattern in cfDNA of a cohort of patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (DLBCL) before, during and after standard treatment
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
OTHER: next generation sequencing|DEVICE: Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)
Determine the clonal evolution during and after treatment by Next Generation Sequencing, DNA from tumor, DNA from peripheral blood and DNA from bone marrow will be sequencing by NGS for a panel of 34 genes., one year
Progression free survival, time between inclusion and progression or relapse or beginning of a new treatment, One year|Overall survival, time between inclusion and death, one year|Assess the clonal architecture in tumor DNA and bone marrow, one year|Compare the Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) procedure and the kinetic and pattern of somatic mutations identified in cfDNA, one year
To determinate and to describe the clonal evolution, 30 DLBCL cases with available matched tumor DNA and plasma will be collected and analyzed by routinely applicable next generation sequencing (NGS) at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and at 12 months after diagnosis.
