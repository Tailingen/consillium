Investigating Integrative Therapies for Symptom Management in Adults With Acute Leukemia
This pilot study will use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Integrative Therapies, a bedside service offering mindfulness-based interventions (still meditation, meditative movement, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy) as non-pharmacologic treatment for symptom management in newly diagnosed adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients undergoing induction chemotherapy
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BEHAVIORAL: Integrative Therapy
Feasibility of Integrative Therapy - proportion agreeing to participate, at least 50% electing to join the intervention, baseline through 3 weeks|Feasibility of Integrative Therapy - proportion of participants who complete at least 5 sessions, a 70% completion rate (indicated by the completion of 5 or more sessions), baseline through 3 weeks|Acceptability of Integrative Therapy, Distribution of responses to acceptability with an acceptability benchmark of at least 75% of Integrative Therapy group members "rating the program as acceptable" via the acceptability questionnaire. Likert scoring 1-5, wit h on as very low and 5 being very high., baseline through 3 weeks
UF Health Integrative Therapies inpatient program offers mindfulness-based interventions consisting of still meditation, meditative movement, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy to patients at the bedside. This mixed methods feasibility pilot aims to move toward optimal use of the Integrative Therapies service amongst AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy by: 1) examining the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention and describing the distribution of variables, 2) developing a greater understanding of patient experience, and 3) exploring facilitators and barriers to engagement with the service. The investigators intend to use the data collected from this study to inform a subsequent multi-site study with a larger sample size and adjustments depending on the results from this investigation.

The study team will also explore the acceptability to participation in Integrative Therapies bedside service by conducting a qualitative, phenomenological thematic analysis of patient interviews. The intent of a convergent design is to merge the analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data that are gathered during the implementation of Integrative Therapies bedside service.
