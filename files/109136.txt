Biology Guided Therapy for Breast Cancer for ER Positive
There are several approved and guideline-recommended treatments for metastatic, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer that has progressed on an aromatase inhibitor and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Right now, doctors do not have a good way of choosing between these treatments. Scientists we work with have come up with ways to use the biology of the tumor to try to predict which treatment is best. This study is being done to test if those predictions are right and to learn more about these tumors to design better treatments in the future.

This is an open-label phase II study of systems biology guided therapy for breast cancer patients positive for Oestrogen receptor after Aromatase inhibitor and CDK inhibition.

Based on the SOLAR-1 trial, 25% of tumors would have PIK3CA mutation, so 25% of people would be treated with fulvestrant plus alpelisib with a median PFS in that group of 11 months and 75% of people would be treated with fulvestrant with a median PFS in that group of 6 months.(3) The weighted average of these medians is 7.25 months, but since the actual distributions of the progression free survivals are not available, we will use a conservative estimate of the expected median PFS of the historical control group (fulvestrant +/- alpelisib as second line unguided therapy) of 8 months.
