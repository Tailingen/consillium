Immunological Repertoire in Patients With Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
RIPAL is a prospective cohort study, which main goal is to define T and B immune repertoire diversity and magnitude in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of high and low grade and chronic lymphocytic leukemia before and after treatment, and to evaluate the association of these parameters with clinical patient data and outcomes.
LYMPHOMA
BIOLOGICAL: blood samplings
change in variations of the T and B cell repertoire in patients with lymphoid blood disease under treatment, results given by the technical Immun'IgH® Human and Human ImmunTraCkeR® and score NDL®

The 2 criteria for obtaining the data are the diversity and intensity of the immune repertoire:

The intensity of the signal corresponds to the frequency of VJ rearrangements detected in the samples. It is expressed in Arbitrary Units.

The diversity corresponds to the number of different VJ rearrangements detected compared to all theoretical VJ rearrangement. It is expressed in percentage., from D0 to 18 months
performance of the mapping of the immune repertoire to predict treatment response, The response to initial treatment will be confronted with the results given by the technical Immun'IgH® Human and Human ImmunTraCkeR® and score NDL®

Response to treatment will be assessed by the local treating physician as complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), partial response (PR), stable disease, or progressive disease (PD) in accordance with the International Workshop Standardized Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and International Workshop Standardized Response Criteria for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia., from D0 to 18 months|performance of the mapping of the immune repertoire to predict progression free survival, the progression free survival will be confronted with the results given by the technical Immun'IgH® Human and Human ImmunTraCkeR® and score NDL®

For all groups except group 8 (LLC untreated): the progression free survival is defined as the number of months elapsed between the first day of treatment (D0) and progression For The group 8: the progression free survival is defined as the number of months elapsed between the first day of the consultation (D0) that led to the confirmation of diagnosis and the date of first treatment., from D0 to progression|performance of the mapping of the immune repertoire to predict the risk of infection, the number of patients with infection will be confronted with the results given by the technical Immun'IgH® Human and Human ImmunTraCkeR® and score NDL® All presumed or confirmed infections such as isolated febrile events associated or not with an identifiable site of infection and/or germ clearly identified, from D0 to 18 months|sensitivity of detection of the circulating clones, results given by the technical Immun'IgH® Human and Human ImmunTraCkeR® and score NDL® will be compared with data obtained from conventional immunophenotypic and molecular data.

The 3 conventional technics are : morphological examination, immunophenotyping, molecular biology by BIOMED2 primers, from D0 to 18 months
Constitution of a prospective cohort of 128 patients with 8 different groups of patients. This protocol is designed to evaluate a new tool for detecting the diversity of the repertoire T and B in patients with hematological disease. This in vitro diagnostic device is consisting of molecular biology kits Human ImmunTraCkeR® and Human Immun'IgH® and the analysis tool NDL®
