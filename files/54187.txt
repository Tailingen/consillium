Adjuvant Treatment of EC Followed by Taxane +/- Carboplatin in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
To compare disease-free survival (DFS) rate of adjuvant chemotherapy epirubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel (EC-T), or weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel-carboplatin (EC-TCb) in triple-negative breast cancer.

Disease-free survival, to compare the disease-free survival among two treatment arms, 3 years
Overall Survival, to compare the overall survival among two treatment arms, 3 years|Incidence of neutropenia fever, to compare the neutropenia fever among two treatment arms, up to 7 months|Incidence of grade 3-4 side effects, to compare the grade 3-4 side effects among two treatment arms, up to 7 months
This study plans to enroll triple-negative breast cancer patients who have complete tumor removal. Patients are randomized to receive either EC-wP/T or EC-wP/TCb adjuvant chemotherapy. For triple-negative breast cancer, a subgroup of triple-negative breast cancer has DNA repairement deficiency and adding carboplatin to paclitaxel may improve DFS on the basis of weekly paclitaxel adjuvant chemotherapy.
