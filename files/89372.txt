Implementation Strategies for Monitoring Adherence in Real Time
The objective of this project is to identify effective strategies to help patients with lung cancer manage side effects and achieve optimal adherence to oral targeted therapies. To achieve this objective, we will evaluate the effect of a novel, bidirectional conversational agent, compared to usual care, on adherence to oral targeted therapies using a two-arm randomized controlled trial, and explore how multilevel factors impact the acceptability and effectiveness of this strategy by collecting qualitative and quantitative data from clinicians and patients.
Lung Cancer|Medication Adherence|Symptoms and Signs
DEVICE: Conversational Agent/Chatbot|OTHER: Usual Care
Adherence, Defined as number of patients who have 95% or greater adherent days across the study period based on their prescribed dose. Adherence data will be assessed via MEMS caps, which capture a date and time stamp each time the pill bottle is opened., 12 weeks after study initiation or at therapy discontinuation, whichever is shorter
Persistence, Defined as the average number of total days on the regimen before discontinuation measured using MEMS caps across participants, 12 weeks after study initiation or at therapy discontinuation, whichever is shorter
Drawing from insights in behavioral economics and implementation science, the goal of our project is to identify effective strategies for improving lung cancer outcomes by helping patients to better manage symptoms and adhere to oral therapies. Given the rapid increase in FDA-approved targeted therapies, the need for such strategies will continue to grow. Our central hypothesis is that conversational agent will improve adherence to oral therapies by targeting patient-level determinants of behavior change. The specific aims are to: 1) Test the effects of a patient-directed intervention (conversational agent) to improve adherence to oral targeted therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.; and 2) Use mixed-methods approaches with clinicians and patients to explore multilevel factors shaping the acceptability, effectiveness, and future implementation of intervention into routine cancer care. Primary trial outcomes (adherence and persistence) will be measured using microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using longitudinal surveys and medical record data.
