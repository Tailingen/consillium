Circulating Tumor DNA Guided Boost Therapy in Early Triple Negative Breast Patients With Residual Disease After Neoadjuvant Therapy
Early triple negative breast cancer patients who do not achieve pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy have bad prognosis. ctDNA effectively identified patients with highest relapse risk.

This trial aims to explore whether the combination of anlotinib, immunotherapy and capecitabine could improve the outcome of this subgroup of high relapse risk patients compared with investigator's choice of therapy.
