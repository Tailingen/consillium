Endoscopic Resection for Small Rectal Neuroendocrine Tumors
In previous single center study, both modified cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (mEMR-C) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) were reported to be effective for the treatment of small rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and mEMR-C was inferior to ESD for the treatment of small rectal NETs (â‰¤10 mm), as it has shorter operation times and lower hospitalization costs. However, a multicenter randomized controlled trial is needed to prove the universality and generality of these findings.

Investigators aimed to conduct a muticenter randomized controlled trial to compare mEMR-C with ESD for the treatment of small rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in six tertiary hospitals in China.
