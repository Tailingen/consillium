Efficacy of Everolimus Combined With First-line Endocrine Therapy for HR+/HER2- SNF1-subtype Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, phase II study to explore the efficacy and safety of Everolimus in combination with standard first-line endocrine therapy for the HR+/ HER2-SNF1 subtype of advanced breast cancer. The study was used to explore the efficacy of Everolimus in combination with standard endocrine therapy.
Breast Cancer|Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus 10 mg|DRUG: CDK4/6 Inhibitor SHR6390|DRUG: Aromatase inhibitor and Fulvestrant combined with CDK4/6 inhibitors
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The interval from randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, which ever occurs first., Approximately 5 years
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is the total percentage of participants who achieved a complete response, partial response, or had stable disease for 6 months or more., Approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on BICR and investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1., Approximately 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., Approximately 5 years|Safety and tolerability, Number of adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0 per each treatment arm., Approximately 5 years
A total of 584 patients with luminal breast cancer who received surgery in the breast surgery Department of the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Fudan University were collected in the early stage. All patients could be divided into four categories, namely SNF1 (classical luminal type), SNF2 (immune-mediated type), SNF1 (proliferative type), and SNF4 (receptor tyrosine kinase-driven type), through clustering by the SNF algorithm. SNF1 (classical luminal type): The transcriptional component type is dominated by PAM50 LumA, with high PIK3CA mutation and low TP53 mutation. By combining artificial intelligence based on H\&E pathological sections with deep learning methodology, molecular typing can be effectively distinguished. Prior to enrollment, the patient's primary lesion or metastasis was classified by molecular classification based on the H\&E section combined with digital pathology, and SNF1 was confirmed to be considered for subsequent enrollment.

Receivers will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either Everolimus plus Standard Endocrine therapy (study group) or Standard Endocrine therapy (control group).

Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, informed withdrawal, or death from any cause.
