A Prospective Phase II Efficacy and Safety Study of Anlotinib in Metastatic or Locally Advanced Pheochromocytoma/ Paraganglioma : Open-label Single-arm, Exploratory Trial
This is an open-label phase II study of an investigational drug, anlotinib in participants with advanced malignant paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumors originating from the adrenal medulla or adrenal diplomatic sensory chain, respectively, which can synthesize and secrete large amounts of catecholamines. In this study, participants whose disease has advanced or spread despite prior standard therapy, will receive anlotinib for 2-weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, until disease progression (PD) or drug toxicity intolerance. Anlotinib is an investigational drug, which has been shown to shrink tumours in several tumour models. The study will evaluate the efficacy as well as the toxicity profile of anlotinib when used as an alternative treatment for participants with PPGL tumours.

This study will be a single arm, open-label, phase II trial of anlotinib in participants with metastatic or locally advanced malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Oral anlotinib (12 mg) will be administered to all participants daily for the first 2 weeks of a 3-week study cycle, followed by a 1 week rest. Participants will be assessed for response to study treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression.
