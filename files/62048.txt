Application of DCE-MRI Based on 4D FreeBreathing in Predicting the Efficacy of Immune and Targeted Therapy in Lung Cancer
This study aims to address the challenge of predicting the efficacy of targeted and immunotherapy in lung cancer patients. By utilizing two DCE-MRI images-one before treatment and one after one treatment cycle-along with the patients' clinical and pathological information, we aim to achieve accurate prediction of the therapeutic efficacy of targeted and immunotherapy in lung cancer patients.
