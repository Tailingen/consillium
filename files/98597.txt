Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network Study for Ontario (MOHCCN-O)
The Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network (MOHCCN) is a national network of cancer centres that pursue collaborative cancer research in precision medicine (an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that considers individual variability in DNA, environment and lifestyle) to accelerate the discovery of innovations and improve the health outcomes for cancer patients

Number of patients included in a pan-Canadian cohort with comprehensive clinical and genomic data, Consolidate and annotate data from patients included in a pan-Canadian cohort, 5 years
Development of standard practices to create a unique shareable dataset of molecular, imaging, clinical and health outcome information on Canadian cancer cases, Improve the cancer research paradigm by bringing teams or researchers together and leverage valuable information genomic and clinical data from Canadian cancer cases., 5 years|Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of precision cancer medicine to advance clinical implementation and reimbursement decisions, Health technology assessment tools will be used to evaluate the real-world value of precision medicine, 5 years|Development and collection of patient-reported outcomes to enhance patient-centeredness in precision cancer medicine, Health technology assessment tools will be used to evaluate the real-world value of precision medicine, 5 years
The purpose of this study is to use evolving technologies such as genomics and artificial intelligence to study cancer so that the right treatment can be given to the right patient, at the right time. Approximately 15,000 participants will take part in the greater MOHCCN study across Canada in the first 5 years, and ultimately the goal is to enroll up to 100,000 over next 10 years.
