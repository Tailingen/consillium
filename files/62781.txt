sFOLFOXIRI in Advanced Gastroesophageal Cancer, (SAGE)
The primary objective is to determine the clinical efficacy of treatment regimen in terms of objective response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives is to determine the clinical efficacy of the study treatment in terms of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Additionally, to characterize the safety and toxicity profile of the study treatment as measured by the adverse event rates.
Gastro-Intestinal Cancer
DRUG: Four week alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI (sFOLFOXIRI)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) criteria version 1.1, To determine the clinical efficacy of treatment regimen in terms of objective response rate., Three Years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To determine the clinical efficacy of the study treatment in terms of progressive free survival., Three Years|Overall Survival (OS), To determine the clinical efficacy of the study treatment in terms of overall survival., Three Years|Adverse Event Rates, Three Years
The overall purpose of this protocol is to serve as a Single Arm Phase II trial of a four week alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI (sFOLFOXIRI), with or without nivolumab, in advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor two (HER2) negative gastric and esophageal cancers (GEC). This study evaluates the hypothesis that the use of sFOLFOXIRI in gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) will increase response rates beyond that expected with FOLFOX, while maintaining acceptable tolerability. The primary endpoint of this study is the objective response rate (ORR) while the key secondary endpoints include the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse event (AE) rates. The goal of this study is to establish the activity level of sFOLFOXIRI, with the thought that this could be further developed in the metastatic and/or peri-operative space if a sufficiently interesting degree of efficacy is observed.
