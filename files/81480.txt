A Study to Measure Needle Bending and Changes in Prostate Shape During a Prostate Seed Implant
Prostate brachytherapy is an effective treatment option for men with localized prostate cancer, with excellent cure rates and a favorable toxicity profile. With the current needle insertion technique, seed placement inaccuracy is primarily caused by needle deflection and soft tissue deformation, which both occur during the brachytherapy operation. This study will accrue 20 patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy implants and acquire a series of ultrasound images, video clips and one CT scan.
