Study of Sotatercept for the Treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Anemia in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (MK-7962-012)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of participants in each sotatercept dose regimen who achieve a hematopoietic response during the treatment period including up to 2 months after the last dose of sotatercept treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) in participants with metastatic breast cancer. Hematopoietic response was defined as an increase in hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 1 g/dL relative to baseline for 28 consecutive days during the treatment period including up to 2 months after the last dose of sotatercept in the absence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion or treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA).
