Effects of Simvastatin and Micronized Trans-resveratrol Treatment on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Patients
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age. Hyperandrogenism is the central feature of PCOS. Studies on isolated ovarian theca-interstitial cells indicate that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reduces androgen production.

This study is designed to evaluate the endocrine and metabolic effects of simvastatin and resveratrol on PCOS.

Methods: A randomized (1:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the effects of administering 20 mg of simvastatin daily and 500 mg of resveratrol daily, or administering 20 mg simvastatin and the placebo to women with PCOS at an academic hospital. PCOS is defined according to the Rotterdam criteria. Evaluations are performed at baseline and repeated after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The main outcome is a change of the serum total testosterone and the fasting insulin level.
