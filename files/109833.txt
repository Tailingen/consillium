A Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Preliminary Efficacy of KD033 (SAR445710) in Subjects With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase1, open-label, sequential dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of KD033 (SAR445710) in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to test KD033 (SAR445710) at different dose levels to see if it is safe and well tolerated when given once every 2 weeks and when given weekly. Additional purposes of the study are to find out whether the study drug has anti-cancer effects and how the study drug is processed by the body.
