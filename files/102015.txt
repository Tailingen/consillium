Cirmtuzumab Consolidation for Treatment of Patients With Detectable CLL on Venetoclax
Single center, open-label, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of cirmtuzumab consolidation in patients with measurable disease on venetoclax.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Cirmtuzumab|DRUG: Venetoclax
Cancer response to treatment, Percentage of subjects with undetectable measurable residual disease after 6 months of cirmtuzumab + venetoclax treatment., 6-24 months
Frequency of adverse events, Number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 9-15 months|Time to next CLL treatment., Measurement of time of anti-cancer activity, 9-24 months
Change in gene expression in leukemic cells, The change in gene expression of leukemia cells by single cell PCR or RNA after treatment with cirmtuzumab, including analysis of archival pre-venetoclax sample, when available., 9-15 months
This is a phase 2 study to test whether cirmtuzumab in combination with venetoclax given as consolidation therapy can decrease the number of cancer cells that may be left in the bone marrow or in the blood in patients who have been treated with venetoclax for at least one year. Consolidation therapy is given after initial cancer treatment to further reduce the number of cancer cells that may be left in the body. Cirmtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor (ROR1) signaling and stemness, may be effective in reducing the risk of disease progression in patients with detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment with venetoclax.
