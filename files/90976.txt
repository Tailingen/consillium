Immersive Virtual Reality Based Exersice in Post-mastectomy Lymphedema Patients
To determine the effect of immersive virtual reality on shoulder proprioception and ROM of post-mastectomy lymphedema patients.
Lymphedema Arm
PROCEDURE: immersive virtual reality|PROCEDURE: traditional physicaltherapy
shoulder proprioception, digital goniometer, 4 weeks
shoulder ROM, all 6 motions will be measured by digital goniometer, 4 weeks
RESEARCH QUESTION:

Does Immersive virtual reality based exercise effective in improving shoulder proprioception and ROM for post-mastectomy patients?

Assessment:

The digital goniometer will be used in measuring shoulder extension, flexion, adduction, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation before the sessions and after one month of sessions. Also, shoulder proprioception will be assessed by the digital goniometer.The measurement will be taken for both the edematous side and the non-affected side.

Treatment:

Study group: the patients will receive eight sessions of Immersive virtual reality based exercise, 2 sessions per week for 4 weeks besides the traditional physical therapy.

Control group: the patients will receive eight sessions of the traditional physical therapy, 2 sessions per week for 4 weeks.
