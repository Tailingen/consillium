CAR2219 CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of R/R B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma
This is a single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR2219 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19/CD22 positive B cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.
Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma
GENETIC: CAR2219-T cells
According to the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) to evaluate the safetyof CAR2219 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+CD22+ B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma., Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) Description: Number and severity of adverse events graded according to CTCAE v5.0, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) graded by ASTCT criteria and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) graded by ASBMT criteria, up to 2 years|According to the determine the Maximal Tolerable Dose(MTD) to evaluate the safetyof CAR2219 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+CD22+ B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma., MTD will be determined based on DLTs observed during the first 28 days of study treatment.
According to the objective response rate (ORR) to evaluate the efficacy of CAR2219 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+CD22+ B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma., Overall response rate (ORR) Description: Proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Lugano 2014 criteria for lymphomas and NCCN guidelines for leukemias, assessed via bone marrow biopsy (for leukemia) and PET/CT imaging (for lymphoma), Within 3 months following infusion of CAR2219 CAR-T cells
CAR-T cell expansion kinetics, Peak CAR-T cell levels (Cmax) and persistence duration measured by flow cytometry and qPCR in peripheral blood, Up to 12 months after CAR-T treatment|CAR-T cell clonality dynamics, Single-cell sequencing was performed to track the clonal evolution of CAR-T cells in patients at 14 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-infusion., Up to 24 months after CAR-T treatment
This study is an exploratory clinical trial of a single-arm, open, single-center treatment of CAR2219 CAR-T cell. 20 subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19/ CD22 positive B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma will be enrolled and received CAR2219 CAR T cells injection therapy, and related data such as adverse reactions and therapeutic effects after medication were followed up. To evaluate its safety and efficacy.
