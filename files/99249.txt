Cyclosporine in Combination With Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Refractory to Carfilzomib and High Expression of PPIA Gene in Myeloma Cells
This phase 1, open-label, single-arm, prospective, single center study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cyclosporine in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

This phase 1, open-label, single-arm, prospective, single center study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cyclosporine in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The patients will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of RRMM, who have received at least two prior lines of therapy including carfilzomib, and were non responsive or refractory to carfilzomib as specified below, and who were found to have elevated expression of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A (PPIA) in scRNA sequencing of their myeloma cells, and who meet other protocol outlined eligibility criteria.

The patients will be treated with cyclosporine with dose titration based on repeated determinations of whole blood concentrations to achieve a target trough concentration of 250 ng/mL, in combination with carfilzomib plus dexamethasone.

Patients may continue to receive treatment for 4 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, the earliest of them.

Subjects will be followed for Adverse Events (AEs), clinical status-Overall response rate (ORR) as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DOR), Time to Progression (TTP), stringent Complete Response (sCR 0, Complete Response (CR), Very Goog Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), Depth of Best Response (DpR), Time To Response (TTR), Progressive Disease (PD), Overall Survival (OS) and laboratory parameters for up to 4 months, unless they terminate early due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or due to meeting one of the withdrawal criteria
