A Multi-Center Trial of Androgen Suppression With Abiraterone Acetate, Leuprolide, PARP Inhibition and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerable dose of niraparib when combined with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), abiraterone, leuprolide, and prednisone (the phase 1 portion of the study) and determine 3-year biochemical PSA recurrence free-survival with this treatment approach (the phase 2 portion of the study).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib|DRUG: Leuprolide|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
Dose-limiting toxicities (Phase 1), The proportion of patients at each dose level with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as any treatment related grade 3-5 adverse event experienced within the first 4 treatment cycles (112 days), assessed per NCI's CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 112 days after initial dose of niraparib|Proportion of patients experiencing biochemical failure, Change in PSA level from the beginning of study treatment for up to 3 years later will determine the biochemical failure rate. Biochemical failure will be defined using the Phoenix definition of the PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL., Up to 3 years after first dose of niraparib
Change in health related quality of life, Assessed via EPIC-26 questionnaire, From baseline up to 3 years after last dose of niraparib|Proportion of patients with undetectable post-treatment PSA, Undetectable PSA will be defined as a PSA â‰¤0.1 ng/mL., Measured during the end of the 6th cycle of therapy (during week 24 +/- 7 days)|Proportion of patients with distant metastases, Distant metastases will be defined as any clinical or radiographic evidence of lymph node, bone, or visceral involvement of prostate cancer., Up to 5 years after first dose of niraparib|Prostate cancer specific survival, Prostate cancer specific survival will be defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to death attributable to prostate cancer. Patients who have not died or die of non-prostate cancer related causes will be censored at the last known follow-up or date of death, respectively. Summarized using cumulative incidence or Kaplan-Meier curves as appropriate., Up to 5 years after first dose of niraparib|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to death from any cause. Patients who have not died will be censored at the last known follow-up.Summarized using cumulative incidence or Kaplan-Meier curves as appropriate., Up to 5 years after first dose of niraparib
