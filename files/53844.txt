Phase II Study of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy in Dose Painting for Sinus Carcinomas After Endoscopic Surgery
The patient is randomized to one of the following groups:

* Experimental group: Radiotherapy in painting dose on histoscannographic mapping
* Control group: standard pan-sinus radiotherapy
Tumor, Solid
RADIATION: Radiotherapy in painting dose on histoscannographic mapping|RADIATION: Standard pan-sinusal Radiotherapy
