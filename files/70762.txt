Salvage Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer Patients With Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy
Despite continuous technical improvements in urologic surgery, up to 40% of prostate cancer patients will develop biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP), potentially because of micro metastasis at the time of the primary surgery.

With improved radiological modalities and nuclear medicine tracers like 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, which allow the localization of the site of recurrence, there is increasing interest in metastasis directed therapies, such as salvage lymph node dissection.

The pelvic extended salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) is a promising option for treating prostate cancer patients with local recurrence after radical prostatectomy with curative intent. Several retrospective series has been published to determine the local value of sLND. Despite the first data seem to be feasible and promising, to date no prospective evaluation has been made. Thus sLND is still experimental according to the guidelines and is considered as an off label therapy.

This prospective single center phase I/II study was conducted to investigate the safety and early efficacy of salvage lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients with local pelvic recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intention.
