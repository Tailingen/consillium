Instylla HES Hypervascular Tumor Pivotal Study
To determine whether Instylla HES has the ability to effectively embolize targeted arterial segments of hypervascular tumors as well as (i.e., is non-inferior to) standard of care (SOC) transarterial embolization/conventional transarterial chemoembolization, while resulting in an acceptable risk of device and procedure-related serious adverse events.
Hypervascular Tumors
DEVICE: Instylla HES|OTHER: TAE or cTACE
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: Delivery of the embolic agent to the index tumor feeding vessel with stasis of flow as determined by an independent radiologist via comparison of the pre and final post procedure images, Stasis of flow defined as absence of contrast flow within the targeted tumor feeding vessel, Immediately post-embolization procedure|Primary Safety Endpoint: Freedom from major adverse events through 30 days post-index procedure, 30 days post-embolization procedure
