Benefit of Hemostatic Sealant in Preservation of Ovarian Reserve
Introduction : The most common technique used for ovarian cystectomy is the stripping technique. After stripping the cyst wall, the subsequent bleeding of the ovarian stromal wound is usually controlled by bipolar coagulation or/and by suturing. However, hemostasis achieved with bipolar coagulation could result in damage to the ovarian reserve. To avoid damage to healthy ovarian tissue, hemostasis using various topical hemostatic agents has been introduced to control post- cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding. Among these, FloSeal (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deer- field, IL, USA) is a hemostatic sealant composed of a gelatin-based matrix and thrombin solution.

Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of topical hemostatic sealants and bipolar coagulation during laparoscopic ovarian benign cyst resection on ovarian reserve by comparing the rates of decrease in anti- Müllerian hormone (AMH).

Methods: A randomized prospective data collection was made on women aged 18-45 years who planned to have laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy at one of two institutions (n = 80), Montpellier University Hospital and Nimes University Hospital, France. Patients were randomly divided into two groups treated with either a topical hemostatic sealant (Floseal) or bipolar coagulation for hemostasis. Preoperative, 3-month and 6-month postoperative AMH levels were checked and the rates of decrease of AMH were compared.

PROCEDURE: Bipolar coagulation|PROCEDURE: Coagulation by FLOSEAL haemostatic agent
Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level preoperative, A biological assessment with determination of the serum AMH level will be carried out for each patient during the preoperative consultation., Between 2 and 17 days before cystectomy|Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level at 3 months, A biological assessment with determination of the serum AMH level will be carried out for each patient, 3 months postoperatively., 3 months after the cystectomy|Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level at 6 months, A biological assessment with determination of the serum AMH level will be carried out for each patient, 6 months postoperatively., 6 months after the cystectomy
Time to achieve hemostasis, The time is measured in minutes from the end of the cystectomy to the end of hemostasis., From the end of the cystectomy to the end of hemostasis (up to 1 hour)|Use of additional hemostatsis technique, Another technique can be used to achieve hemostasis: bipolar forceps, suture or second hemostasis agent. The other technique will be specified if it is used, From the end of the cystectomy to the end of hemostasis, during surgery|Blood loss, Blood loss will be measured in ml throughout the surgery., From the start of the surgery to the end of hemostasis|Intraoperative adverse effects, Adverse effects related to the coagulation procedure will be collected., From the end of the cystectomy to the end of hemostasis|Revision surgery for bleeding at the operative site, In the event of bleeding at the operative site, revision surgery may be necessary. In this case the information will be collected., From the end of the cystectomy to the end of hemostasis
