Opportunistic Salpingectomy at the Time of Benign Laparoscopic Hysterectomy
In this prospective study, patients who underwent benign laparoscopic hysterectomy with systematic salpingectomy were included. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of tubal histopathological abnormalities such as Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) and tumor protein 53 (p53) signatures) as well as the prevalence of perioperative and postoperative complications related to opportunistic laparoscopic salpingectomy in a low risk population. The hypothesis is that prophylactic salpingectomy during benign laparoscopic hysterectomy is both feasible and innocuous. Peri- and postoperative complications, duration of salpingectomy and post-salpingectomy blood loss, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis with anti-p53 antibody were evaluated.
