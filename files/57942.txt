A Pilot Study of "OncozeneTM" Microspheres for Intra-arterial Delivery of Doxorubicin
This is a pilot study of Onconzene Microspheres for intra-arterial delivery of doxorubicin for the treatement of patients with unresectable hepatocellular cancer.
Hepatocellular Cancer
OTHER: Oncozene-DEB-TACE
Response, Treatement response will be measured using modified RECIST assessment for hepatocellular cancer. Patients will undergo a maximum of 3 treatments each, at least 4 weeks apart unless there is a complete response as per mRECIST criteria (no enhancing tumor on subsequent CT or MRI scan), (Oncozene-DEB-TACE): TACE 1 Day 22-28, TACE 2-6 Day 22-28, Follow up after completion of treatemtent every 4-6 weeks up to 36 weeks.
Progression, Treated lesion will be evaluated for progression. Progression will be defined according to the mRECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).Patients will undergo a maximum of 3 treatments each, at least 4 weeks apart unless there is a complete response as per mRECIST criteria (no enhancing tumor on subsequent CT or MRI scan)

., (Oncozene-DEB-TACE): TACE 1 Day 22-28, TACE 2-6 Day 22-28, Follow up after completion of treatemtent every 4-6 weeks up to 36 weeks.
The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin loaded ONCOZENE microspheres chemoemobilization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

The study will also describe the overall response rates of lesions with Oncozene-DEB-TACE(Trans-arterial chemoemobilization) per modified RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).

Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following Oncozene-DEB-TACE (Trans-arterial chemoemobilization)
