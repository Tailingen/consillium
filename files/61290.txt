Myopenia and Mechanisms of Chemotherapy Toxicity in Older Adults With Colorectal Cancer
This study will examine the association between low muscle mass (myopenia) at diagnosis and chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with newly diagnosed advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer|Sarcopenia
Number of Chemotherapy Toxicities (Grade 3 - 5), Chemotoxicity will be measured after initiation of chemotherapy using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)., Up to 6 months (after initiation of chemotherapy)
Overall Survival, Participants will be followed for the duration of the study with each participant followed for at least one year after diagnosis, to determine vital status. Loss-to-follow-up will be minimized by asking participating sites to provide date of last contact every 3 months., 1 year
This is a prospective cohort study that examines the impact of myopenia on chemotherapy toxicity in overall survival (OS) in older adults with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving 5-Fluouracil (5FU)systemic chemotherapy. The study also explores the mediating influence of genetic variation in the association between myopenia and chemotherapy toxicity.
