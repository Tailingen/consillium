Outcomes and Prognostic Factors in Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy
1. In biliary tract malignancies, achieving a microscopically clear resection margin (R0) is considered the only treatment for a cure.
2. Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy(HPD) has been considered a surgical option for patients with extensive bile duct or gallbladder cancer to achieve an R0 resection.
3. The associated high morbidity and mortality rates have prevented HPD from becoming a standard surgical procedure worldwide.
4. Over the past few decades, the understanding of the bile duct anatomy has significantly improved, and many methods have been developed to assess liver function and future remnant liver volume.
5. We aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of HPD and to assess risk factors associated with survival, early recurrence, and major complications to better evaluate the potential of the procedure as a standard treatment.

5-year overall survival, the time from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up., assessed up to 60months|5-year disease-free survival, from the date of surgery to the first instance of recurrence, death, or last follow-up date., assessed up to 60months
Post operative complications, Complications occured after the HPD. For example, there are post-hepatectomy liver failure, postoperative pancreatic fistula, ileus, fluid collection, pleural effusion, and etc., assessed up to 30 days from the surgery
