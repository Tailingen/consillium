Safety and Efficacy of Degradable Microsphere in Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study was to prospectively collect clinical data from patients who underwent hepatic artery chemoembolization using microspheres with different degradation times (2 hours, 1 day, 2 weeks) based on standard treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Nexsphereâ„¢
Incidence of postembolism syndrome, Nausea, vomiting, persistent pain, fever, and other, 8 weeks|Incidence of liver function impairment, AFP, AST, ALT, BILI, GGT, BUN, and CREAT level, 8 weeks
Tumor treatment response, Evaluation of tumor size by Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography scan at 4 and 8 weeks after embolization, 8 weeks|Hepatic artery damage, Vessel dissection, vessel stenosis, vessel occlusion, vessel wall irregularity, and other, 8 weeks
This study is a prospective study, and the purpose of this study is to investigate and collect clinical information on the safety and efficacy of degradable microsphere for hepatic artery chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of postembolism syndrome and liver function impairment after hepatic artery chemoembolization, and the secondary purpose was to evaluate tumor treatment response and hepatic artery damage after 1 month of hepatic artery chemoembolization.
