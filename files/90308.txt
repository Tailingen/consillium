Fecal DNA Methylation Detection for Gastric Cancer
The study is a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of fecal methylation-based testing in comparison with the 'gold standard' imaging tests, such as CT, gastroscopy and/or pathology, for the prediction of gastric cancer in an enrolled population.

Sensitivity and specificity of fecal DNA methylation testing based on its application for early diagnosis and screening of gastric cancer., Baseline
Aims of the study Primary study aim: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of fecal methylation site-based tests for the prediction of gastric cancer.

Secondary research objectives: 1. the accuracy, kappa value, area under the ROC curve, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of fecal methylation locus test for the prediction of gastric cancer; 2. whether the predictive ability is significantly higher than that of conventional tumour markers, such as CA19-9, CEA, and CA72-4, etc.; 3. The predictive ability of the combined fecal H. pylori gastric cancer susceptibility test was assessed.

Study design Prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study. Study period 2 years from the start of the project as approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.

Target population The target population is over 40 years old in areas with a high incidence of gastric cancer.

Sample size The sample size of this study should not be less than 10,800 cases.
