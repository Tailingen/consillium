Study of Mogamulizumab With DA-EPOCH in Patients With Aggressive T Cell Lymphoma
Single- arm Phase II study evaluating the combination of mogamulizumab (MOGA) added on top of standard of care dose adjusted EPOCH (DA-EPOCH) in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory (for CTCL only) aggressive T cell lymphoma including patients with Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).
T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Mogamulizumab|DRUG: DA-EPOCH Protocol
Complete response after 6 cycles of treatment with the combination Mogamulizumab and standard of care DA-EPOCH, As assessed by the Lugano criteria for PTCL(16) and the global response score for CTCL(17), 6 cycles (126 Days)
Occurrence of toxicity, using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5) for grading., 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from enrollment to earliest of progression, death or follow-up, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), defined as time from the time from enrollment to earlier of death or last follow-up, 2 years|Duration of response, (including both scenarios -censored at the time of subsequent therapy without disease progression, such as stem cell transplant and total duration including after SCT), 2 Years|Time to best response, Defined as the time from treatment initiation to best response, 2 years
This is a single arm, open label, multicenter phase 2 study of DA-EPOCH and Mogamulizumab in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory (for CTCL only) aggressive T-cell lymphomas including ATLL and transformed Mycosis Fungoides/SÃ©zary syndrome (MF/SS). The hypothesis is that this combination is effective and will produce a CR rate of 80%. DA-EPOCH and Mogamulizumab will be administered for 6 cycles and depending on the histology, consolidative strategies including SCT will be considered. Response assessments will occur at pre-specified intervals. Dose adjustments for specific toxicities with drugs are detailed in the protocol. Based on statistical analysis, a maximum of 36 patients will need to be accrued to evaluate for disease response based on historical control.
