TACE Combined With Bevacizumab in HCC (BCLC-B) Beyond Up-To-Seven Criteria
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with anti-VEGF (Bevacizumab Biosimilar) in patients with BCLC-B stage hepatocellular carcinoma beyond up-to-seven criteria.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma by BCLC Stage
DRUG: Bevacizumab Biosimilar QL 1101
Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to 2 years)
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST., From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, stable disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to 2 years)|Duration of response (DOR) by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST., From the first documentation of CR or PR to the first date of documentation of disease progression or death whichever occurs first (up to 2 years)|Progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, assessed by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST., From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to 2 years)|Overall survival rate (OSR), OSR in 6- and 12-months., From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 2 years)|Progression-free survival time (mPFS), The progression-free survival time (mPFS) defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIS., From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 2 years)|Median overall survival time (mOS), ase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and the participants who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the participant was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes earlier., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to 2 years)
Treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to 2 years)
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with anti-VEGF (Bevacizumab Biosimilar) in patients with BCLC-B stage hepatocellular carcinoma beyond up-to-seven criteria. Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Bevacizumab Biosimilar after TACE until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, patient withdrawal or the investigators determine that the drug must be discontinued.

The primary outcome is the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary outcomes include the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival rate (OSR) in 6- and 12-months, the median progression-free survival time (mPFS) and median overall survival time (mOS). This study also aims to assess the safety and adverse events of TACE combined with anti-VEGF (Bevacizumab Biosimilar) for HCC (BCLC-B stage) beyond up-to-seven criteria.
