Clinical and Molecular-Metabolic Phase II Trial of Perifosine for Recurrent/Progressive Malignant Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of perifosine in preventing further tumor growth using the established optimal dose of the drug. A second goal is to determine if perifosine can block the molecules in the tumor that drive it to divide and grow.

DRUG: Perifosine
Determine the Efficacy of Perifosine in Patients With Recurrent/Progressive GBMs Not Taking EIAEDs as Measured by 6 Month Progression Free Survival/PFS., 6 months
Determine Metabolic Effects of Perifosine on Malignant Gliomas by PET Imaging, 2 years
This is a phase II study of the small molecule inhibitor perifosine (NSC 639966, D21266, KRX-0401) in the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other recurrent malignant gliomas. The goal of the phase II study is to determine efficacy as measured by the progressionfree survival rate after 6 months of treatment. Secondary goals include determination of molecular and metabolic effects of perifosine by tissue analysis and PET imaging.

In addition, when cytoreductive surgery is recommended as part of the standard of care at study entry, patients will be considered for a "surgical arm." In this case, patients will receive perifosine for 5-10 days before surgery during which tumor will be aliquoted both for diagnostic purposes and for molecular effects of the drug in vivo and for analysis of drug penetration into tumor tissue.
