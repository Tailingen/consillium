Older Men's Decision Making About Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer - Aim 3: Decision Aid Efficacy Testing
This protocol describes pilot testing of an educational shared decision-making intervention to help men with localized prostate cancer make decisions with their health care providers about if and when to de-escalate surveillance testing. The project is important because for many patients their cancer does not progress to the point of needed curative treatment or their health status changes such that they are no longer good candidates for treatment. For these men, de-escalating ongoing surveillance (e.g., fewer biopsies or imaging studies) is a reasonable option.
Prostate Cancer
Preparation for Decision Making Scale, The Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PrepDM)19 is a validated scale that assesses whether the decision aid helped prepare a patient to talk with their clinician in making a treatment decision. The scale has 10 items with a 5-point Likert response format,

Score Scale 1 (not at all) and 5 (a great deal)., Through study completion and average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

The overall goal of this protocol is to test initial efficacy of three versions of an educational tool for use by patients and health-care providers to help men with localized prostate cancer make informed decisions about discontinuation of active surveillance. A pre-post design was selected to provide initial efficacy data of the different versions of the shared decision-making intervention. Thereby, providing preliminary data in preparation for a follow-up comparative study.
