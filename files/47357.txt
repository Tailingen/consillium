Study on Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Total Two-field Lymph Node Dissection of Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after total two-field lymph node dissection were randomized into the adjuvant chemotherapy group or the postoperative observation group
Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: chemotherapy
Disease-free survival, Patients were images with computed tomography (CT) scan, At most 5 years after enrollment
overall survival, Patients were images with computed tomography (CT) scan, At most 5 years after enrollment
Patients with T≥3 or N≥1 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after total two-field lymph node dissection were randomly enrolled into the experimental group for adjuvant chemotherapy or the controlled group for postoperative observation. The experimental group received 4-course chemotherapy of docetaxel combined with nedaplatin, and to observe the 3-year progression free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) in two groups.
