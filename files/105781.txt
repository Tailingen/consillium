A Study of LY3007113 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of different doses of an experimental treatment in participants with advanced cancer.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: LY3007113
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Adverse Events (AEs) (Physical Assessments and Clinical Lab Tests), Data presented are the number of participants who experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened after randomization. A summary of serious AEs and all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Baseline through Study Completion (up to 170 Days)
The Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Response of Either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR): Overall Response Rate (ORR), Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter without notable worsening of additional tumors that were qualitatively assessed., Baseline through Study Completion (up to 170 Days)|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of Single Dose LY3007113, Cycle 1 Days -3, -2, -1, 1: Predose to 48 hours Postdose|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve From 0 to Tau (AUC[0-tau]) of Multiple Dose LY3007113, Cycle 1 Days 28 and 29, Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose to 24 hours Postdose|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY3007113, Cycle 1 Day -3 (single dose): Predose to 48 hours Postdose; Day 28 (multiple dose): Predose to 24 hours Postdose
