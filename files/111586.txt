Study of IMO-2055 in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma
* Multi-Center
* Randomized
* Open-Label Study of single agent IMO-2055
* Patients who have Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma (RCC)
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: IMO-2055
Best Response by RECIST v1.0, Best overall objective (i.e., radiological) response by RECIST v1.0 for target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR in patients with clear cell metastatic or locally recurrent renal cell carcinoma treated with IMO-2055., From start of treatment every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles), 1 month post-treatment, then every 3 months (up to 1 year) until documented disease progression or initiation of an alternative therapeutic treatment regimen.
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Grade/Severity, Number of patients with Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by National Cancer Institute (NCI) grade/severity that began on or after the date of the first injection of study drug or worsened in severity or frequency after study drug was administered., From start of treatment through one month after the end of study visit (up to 28 weeks)|Duration of Response by RECIST v1.0, Time in days from the date of the first response by RECIST v1.0 to documented disease progression or death from any cause., Every 8 weeks (2 cycles) from first response to documented disease progression during treatment, 1 month post-treatment, then every 3 months (up to 1 year) until documented disease progression or initiation of an alternative therapeutic treatment regimen.|Overall Survival at 1 Year, Overall survival is defined as (date of death +1 - date of randomization). Patients without an event (death) during treatment or follow-up will have their date censored on the last visit the patient was known to be alive., From date of randomization until the date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, asses up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug.|Time to Disease Progression., Time between the date of randomization to the Study Day of documented disease progression (an increase in tumor burden of at least 20%, appearance of new lesions, or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease) or death (whichever comes first) by RECIST v1.0. Patients who had not progressed at last disease assessment, but whose progression status was unknown at the date last known alive, date of death, or date of study exit (whichever comes first), had event time censored at the date of last assessment. Patients who did not die and did not progress during treatment or follow-up had their event time censored on the last contact date., Every 8 weeks (2 cycles) during the study and every 3 months for 1 year until documented disease progression
This is a study of 2 dose levels (0.16 or 0.64 mg/kg) of IMO-2055 administered by weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections in two patient populations, treatment na√Øve or previously treated patients. Each dose group (treatment naive or previously treated) will be randomized to receive one of the 2 doses being studied.
