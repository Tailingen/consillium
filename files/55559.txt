Phase 1 Study of Autologous CD30.CAR-T in Relapsed or Refractory CD30 Positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a phase 1 study to evaluate safety and dose-limiting toxicity of autologous CD30.CAR-T in subjects with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma|Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL)
DRUG: CD30.CAR-T
To evaluate safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of autologous CD30.CAR-T and establish the recommended Phase dose, Incidence of DLTs and occurrence of study related adverse events, Day 0 to 28 for DLT
To evaluate pharmacokinetics of autologous CD30.CAR-T, AUC (copies/ug DNA over time), Start of infusion of CD30.CAR-T (Day 0) until year 5|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, Start of CD30.CAR-T (Day 0) until progressive disease or start of new cancer therapy, whichever comes first, up to one year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, Start of CD30.CAR-T (day 0) until progressive disease or death, whichever comes first, up to one year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, Start of CD30.CAR-T (Day 0) until progressive disease or death, whichever comes first, up to one year
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma who have failed standard available therapies and who meet eligibility criteria will have blood drawn to manufacture the CD30.CAR-T cells.

CD30.CAR-T cells will be infused once following the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy with Bendamustine and Fludarabine.

Subjects will be closely monitored for DLT and safety.
