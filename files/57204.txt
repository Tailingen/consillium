Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized Study, Evaluating the Efficacy and Tolerability of Focused HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) Therapy Compared to Active Surveillance in Patients With Significant Low Risk Prostate Cancer
The percentage of malignant prostate tumors detected very early is constantly increasing and the number of well differentiated tumors, with small volume and low risk of progression increases. When a tumor of this type is identified, radical prostatectomy remains the reference treatment, but this treatment is not without side effects. Active surveillance is a strategy which aims at detecting an early development of the cancerous disease in order to propose curative treatment in a timely manner and thus improve specific survival. Patients are therefore re-evaluated each year by rectal examination, PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) assay. Active surveillance remains difficult to manage psychologically for both the patient and the practitioner, because of the lack of treatment on the one hand and a rate of non-curable cancers close to 50% when signs of progression trigger a radical treatment.

The aim of the focal treatment HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) is to destroy the cancer without causing side effects in contrast to radical treatments. It is in this sense that it is positioned both as an alternative to radical surgery and as an alternative to active surveillance.

patient proportion who needed to seek radical treatment, The primary endpoint is the comparison between the 2 groups of the proportion of patient converting to a radical treatment at 48 months of follow-up. Conversion to a radical treatment is define as a medical decision based on the following criteria:

* An increase in Gleason score to a score 7 (3 + 4) with bilateral involvement (Gleason 6 or 7).
* An increase in the Gleason score to a score 7 (3 + 4) with tumor whose location is not compatible with a focal treatment (impossibility to apply safety margins of 9mm).
* An increase in Gleason score to a score of 7 (4 + 3) or higher.
* Risk of lymph node invasion\> 5% (calculated with the MSKCC nomogram)
* An extension of the tumor beyond the prostatic capsule (MRI and / or biopsies).
* Appearance of pelvic ganglion metastases., 48 month
proportion of patients needing additional treatment, The objective is to compare between the 2 groups the proportion of patients needing additional treatment (focal or radical) at 24 months. This includes patients who wish or require radical treatment (prostatectomy, radiotherapy), total focal treatment, focal treatment for patients in the active surveillance group or additional treatment for patients in the treatment group., 24 months|proportion of patients needing additional treatment, The objective is to compare between the 2 groups the proportion of patients needing additional treatment (focal or radical) at 48 months.
