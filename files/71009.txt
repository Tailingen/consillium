A Safety and Preliminary Efficacy Study of SBT6290 Alone and in Combination With PD-(L)1 Inhibitors in Select Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study designed to investigate SBT6290 administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression.

This is a first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of SBT6290 administered subcutaneously (SC) as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in solid tumors associated with Nectin-4 expression. There are 4 parts to this study:

* Part 1: A dose escalation of SBT6290 monotherapy
* Part 2: Tumor-specific expansion cohorts evaluating SBT6290 monotherapy administered at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) identified in Part 1
* Part 3: A dose escalation of SBT6290 in combination with pembrolizumab
* Part 4: An expansion cohort of SBT6290 in combination with pembrolizumab administered at the RP2D identified in Part 3 for the combination
