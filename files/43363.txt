Amrubicin + Cyclophosphamide in Advanced Solid Organ Malignancies
Amrubicin has shown single-agent activity in lung cancer. The combination of cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines has been studied and concluded that the combination was tolerable, could be given safely, and therapeutically useful.

This Phase I study will evaluate the combination of cyclophosphamide with amrubicin in relapsed solid tumors and will define the MTD of the combination in a US population.

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

This study will follow the 3+3 design with the following dose levels:

* Dose Level -1: Amrubicin 20mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2
* Dose Level 1: Amrubicin 25mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2
* Dose Level 2: Amrubicin 30mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2
* Dose Level 3: Amrubicin 35mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2
* Dose Level 4: Amrubicin 40mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

Dose escalation starts from dose level 1.

Amrubicin will be given as a slow IV push or infusion over approximately 5 minutes once daily for 3 consecutive days starting on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.

Cyclophosphamide will be given at a fixed dose as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each 21 day cycle (following amrubicin).
