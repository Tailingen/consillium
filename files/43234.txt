FET-PET/MRI for Surgical Assessment of Pediatric Brain Tumors
The primary objectives of this study are:

1. Determine the percentage of patients whose surgical plan would change with FET-PET/MRI compared to MRI alone.
2. Determine the percentage of patients who have residual tumor after surgery detected with FET-PET/MRI.

A secondary objective of this study is:

1) Perform preliminary correlations between the pre- and post-surgical metabolic tumor volumes measured with FET-PET/MRI to progression free survival.
Pediatric Brain Tumors
DRUG: FET PET/MRI
Percentage of patients whose surgical plan change with FET-PET/MRI compared to MRI alone., Surgical planning will be performed prior to brain tumor resection based on MRI alone and then with FET-PET/MRI. The surgical margins will be compared and the percentage of patients whose surgical plans change with FET-PET/MRI will be calculated., 2 years|Percentage of patients who have residual tumor after surgery detected with FET-PET/MRI, The percentage of patients with residual tumor identified with FET-PET/MRI will be measured. This percentage will be compared to detection of residual tumor by MRI alone., 2 years
