Phase Ib Study of Radium Ra 223 Dichloride in Combination With Paclitaxel in Cancer Subjects With Bone Lesions
This phase Ib combination study is being conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of radium Ra 223 dichloride in combination with paclitaxel in cancer subjects with bone lesions with special focus on Grade 3/4 incidence of neutro- and/or thrombocytopenia and exploration of the mode of interaction (i.e. additive or synergistic interaction) between the selected chemotherapy and radium Ra 223 dichloride with regard to myelosuppression.
