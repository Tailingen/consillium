Pilot Study of 18F-FMISO PET/CT and MRI Imaging to Explore Tissue Hypoxia and Arteriovenous Shunting in Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma Before and After Bevacizumab Treatment
Subjects with recurrent glioblastoma who are candidates for bevacizumab treatment according to standard of care will be eligible for this study. Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will use the investigational radiotracer \[18F\]FMISO to image the brain and evaluate for hypoxia pre and post therapy.. Subjects will also undergo up to three Brain MRIs.
