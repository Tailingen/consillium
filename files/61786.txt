Predictive Factors of Pelvic Magnetic Resonance in the Response of Arterial Embolization of Uterine Leiomyoma
The purpose of this study is to determine predictive factors in the pelvic magnetic resonance in the response of arterial embolization of uterine leiomyoma.
Exposure to Magnetic Field|Uterine Leiomyoma
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Image
Leiomyoma reduction in patients who underwent uterine artery embolization, Use the magnetic resonanse to evaluate factors that predicted leiomyoma reduction in patients who underwent uterine artery embolization, One month before(baseline) and six month after the embolization
This study followed symptomatic premenopausal women with uterine leiomyoma who underwent uterine artery embolization (UAE). Treatment was accompanied by magnetic resonance imaging of both the volume of the entire uterus and the leiomyomas one month before and six months after UAE. This patients were treated at the Uterine Leiomyoma Sector of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medicine College of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. In this study, the investigators examined 179 leiomyomas in 50 patients.
