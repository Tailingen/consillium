Supplementation of L-arginine in Patients With Non-resectable Brain Metastases
This study evaluates the nutritional supplement arginine as supportive measure for patients with unresectable metastatic brain tumors that receive radiation therapy with palliative intent
Unresectable Multiple Brain Metastases
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: L-arginine hydrochloride solution|OTHER: Placebo
Change from baseline of the scoring form NCI CTCAE v3 for detecting and quantifying potential adverse events, NCI CTCAE v3 form will be completed baseline and every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration thereafter. This form will detect adverse events including clinical laboratory alterations associated with the administration of of L-arginine or placebo including those that may exacerbate the adverse events expected from the radiation therapy, Baseline and thereafter every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change from baseline of quality of life questionnaire, Quality of life questionnaire with assessment of the Karnofsky's index will be completed baseline and every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration thereafter, Baseline and thereafter every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change from baseline in signs and symptoms of neurological disease, Signs and symptoms of neurological disease will be evaluated by caregiver and investigator according to response criteria evaluation guidelines. Clinical response will be considered as the changes in signs and symptoms that occur between baseline state and 30 days counted from the last day of treatment, Baseline and at 4 weeks counted from the last day of treatment
Imaging response, The investigators will follow the R.E.C.I.S.T. criteria for imaging and overall response evaluation, One month after the last day of radiation and one month after the first response assessment|Neurological progression-free survival, The investigators will follow the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines for imaging (CT and MRI) response evaluation based on measurable disease, assessed up to 50 months, Time with no radiological or symptomatic progression counted from the first of radiation therapy until the day of first documented neurological progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 months
Intensity of radiation administered, Actual daily and total dose of radiation administered as fractional product of the planned (proposed) daily and total dose of radiation, From the first of radiation therapy through study completion, an average of 1 year|effects on tumor metabolism by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Before and one hour after the first dose of L-arginine (or placebo) administration without radiation therapy, Before and one hour after the first dose of L-arginine (or placebo) administration without radiation therapy|Change from baseline in cytokine pattern in serum, The investigators will determine levels of circulating (serum) cytokines in a sub-group of patients from both arms to determine immune effects of L-arginine.

Comments \[5\] :, Before treatment (baseline), at 4 weeks after the last of treatment and at 8 weeks after the last of treatment|Change from baseline in body weight, Body weight (kg) will be determined baseline and every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration thereafter. The reported value will be number of patients with change of 10% or higher in any value at any time point from baseline, Baseline and thereafter every 7 days starting from day 1 of L-arginine or placebo administration and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression free survival, The investigators will follow the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines for imaging (CT and MRI) response evaluation based on measurable disease assessed up to 50 months, Time with no radiological or symptomatic progression in any site of disease counted from the first of radiation therapy until the day of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 50 months|Overall survival, Survival time counted from the day 1 of radiation therapy to death or lost of follow-up, assessed up to 50 months, Survival time counted from the first of radiation therapy until the date of death from any cause or lost of follow-up, assessed up to 50 months
Brain metastasis, the most common intracranial tumor, is associated with neurological disability and short survival time. For selected patients this outcome can be improved by achieving greater local control. Virtually all cancer patients with brain metastases receive radiotherapy; a majority as part of their primary treatment while others in connection with surgery or palliation. Agents that increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation may improve the control of the disease. Previous data indicates that arginine supplementation can modify the metabolism of cancer and immune cells making tumors more susceptible to standard treatments liked radiation. In this phase 1/2 comparative study the investigators will investigate whether 10 mg of arginine oral supplementation (compared to placebo administration) administered twice a day prior to the radiation therapy can modify tumor metabolism, immune response and effect of radiation. The primary end-points are safety and toxicity of arginine, quality-of-life and clinical response. The secondary end-points are imaging response and neurological progression-free survival. Additional exploratory end-points include intensity of radiation administered, effects on tumor metabolism by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, immune response by cytokine pattern in serum, body composition and nutritional parameters , overall survival and progression free survival
