A Study of BBI503 in Combination With Selected Anti-Cancer Therapeutics in Adult Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study of BBI503 administered in combination with selected anti-cancer therapeutics in adult patients with advanced cancer. The goal of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of BBI503 in combination with each of the selected anti-cancer agents.

Determination of the safety and tolerability of BBI503 administered in combination with selected anti-cancer therapeutics by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 3 or 4 weeks based on the cycle of the selected anti-cancer therapeutics|Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 3 or 4 weeks based on the cycle of the selected anti-cancer therapeutics
Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity by performing tumor assessments every 8 weeks (Phase 2 portion), Evaluation of anti-tumor activity will be performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., 6 months|Pharmacokinetic profile of BBI503 administered in combination with selected anti-cancer therapeutics as assessed by maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 hours on day 1, cycles 1 and 2|Pharmacodynamic activity of BBI503 administered in combination with selected anti-cancer therapeutics as assessed by biomarker analysis, Histopathology and Cancer Stem Cell assays will be performed to provide information of the biomarkers on biopsied patient tumor tissue, and archival samples., 3 or 4 weeks based on the cycle of the selected anti-cancer therapeutics
