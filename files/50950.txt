A Study of RC118 Plus Toripalimab / RC148 in Patients with Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion phase I/II study. The Phase I study will explore the tolerability and safety of RC118 in combination with Toripalimab for the treatment of patients with Claudin 18.2-positive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant solid tumors, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose in phase II clinical trials (RP2D); The Phase II study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC118 in combination with Toripalimab or RC148 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Gastric cancer/Gastro-esophageal junction cancer.
