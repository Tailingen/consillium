The Early Diagnosis of Pulmonary Nodule Based on Multi-dimension Messages
The researchers are aimed to investigate the early diagnosis of pulmonary nodule based on DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites through analyzing the serum, plasma, urine, faeces, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), exhaled breath condensate and clinical characteristics.
Pulmonary Nodule, Solitary|Lung; Node
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: The serum, plasma, urine, faeces, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), exhaled breath condensate and the clinical characteristics are collected.
Up-regulation of ctDNA, the first day subjects are enrolled the outcome will be assessed
By recruiting people with pulmonary nodules identified by CT scans, three groups are confirmed as the lung cancer group, the benign lung nodule group who are identified by pathological analysis, and the small lung nodule group that should be followed up. Then the serum, plasma, urine, faeces, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), exhaled breath condensate and the clinical characteristics including age, sex, smoking status, BMI, address, greening environment and the laboratory tests are collected to analyze the ctDNA, RNA, protein, metabolites, immune status and their relationships with the tumorigenesis and the gene mutation of lung cancer.
