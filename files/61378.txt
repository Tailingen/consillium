Chidamide in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the start of treatment until progression or death,whichever is first met, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 76 weeks
Progression-Free Survival Rate at 6 Months (6-M-PFS), 6-M-PFS is defined as the percentage of participants whose disease is still progression-free at the 6th month, 6 months|Object Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with Complete Response and Partial Response,assessed by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Response is assessed once every 6 weeks (combination therapy period) for up to 12 weeks, and once every 8 weeks (maintenance therapy period) for up to 64 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is measured from the first date when criteria for response is met until the first date when the criteria for progression is met, From the first date of response until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 70 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the start of treatment until death, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, followed for up to 76 weeks|Time To Progression (TTP) during the maintenance therapy period, TTP is assessed for patients who complete the 12 weeks of combination therapy. It is measured from the start of maintenance therapy until the criteria of progression is met, From the start date of maintenance therapy until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 64 weeks
The study is to evaluate efficacy which includes the progression free survival (PFS), PFS at 6 months, objective response rate, duration of response rate, overall survival and time to progression, and safety which include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests, of the treatment of chidamide plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer.
