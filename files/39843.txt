Haploid Allogeneic Transplant Using the CliniMACS System
To assess the proportion of patients with donor neutrophil engraftment within 30 days of allogeneic transplant. To assess the incidence of acute GvHD during the first 100 days after transplantation.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) - Relapsed, Primary Refractory Disease or Poor Risk Factors|Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) - Accelerated or Second Chronic Phase|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) - High and Intermediate Risk|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Refractory
DEVICE: CliniMACS System
Neutrophil Engraftment, Number of subjects recovering neutrophils, assessed as 1st of 3 consecutive days on which ANC \> 0.5x10e9/L, 30 days post-transplant
Acute GvHD (Grade II-IV), Number of subjects with acute GvHD (grade II-IV) within 100 days post-transplant, per the Consensus Conference on Acute GvHD Grading (Przepiorka D, et al. Bone Marrow Transplantation. 1995. 15:825-828)., within 100 days post-transplant|Platelet Recovery, Number of subjects recovering platelets to \> 20x10e9/L, assessed on the 7th day unsupported by platelet transfusions, 40 days
To assess the proportion of patients with donor neutrophil engraftment within 30 days of allogeneic transplant; assess the incidence of acute GvHD during the first 100 days after transplantation; and assess platelet engraftment, graft failure, chronic GvHD, clinical safety, and devise performance.
