QUILT-2.014: Gemcitabine and AMG 479 in Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
AMG 479 is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that targets type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R). Signaling through IGF-1R plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and survival. The primary purpose of the study is to determine if AMG 479 and gemcitabine improves overall survival as compared to placebo and gemcitabine.
