Adapting and Testing a Novel Self-Compassion Intervention to Reduce Lung Cancer Stigma
The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to test a disease-tailored, mindfulness-based intervention (Mindful Self-Compassion for Lung Cancer; MSC-LC) in adults diagnosed with lung cancer who are experiencing stigma. The current project seeks to:

* Evaluate preliminary evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MSC-LC in reducing stigma for adults with lung cancer, compared to a waitlist control condition
* Elicit interventional impact not captured through quantitative measures with qualitative data from purposively sampled high responders and non-responders from the intervention condition

Participants will randomized to either the MSC-LC intervention (a 10-week, virtually-delivered, group-based psychosocial intervention focused on the development of mindfulness and self-compassion skills) or to a waitlist control group that receives a referral to an NCI list of helpful mental health resources in their community. Researchers will compare the intervention and control groups to see if the MSC-LC intervention reduces lung cancer stigma and increases self-compassion.

Lung Cancer Stigma Inventory, The Lung Cancer Stigma Inventory is a self-report questionnaire of lung cancer stigma, which includes 25 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 25-125, with higher scores indicating higher lung cancer stigma., Study Entry, 5 weeks (mid-intervention), 10 weeks (post-intervention; primary outcome), 16 weeks (long-term follow-up)
Patient Health Questionnaire-8, The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 is a self-report questionnaire of depressive symptoms, which includes 8 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0-24, with higher scores indicating higher depressive symptoms., Study Entry, 5 weeks (mid-intervention), 10 weeks (post-intervention), 16 weeks (long-term follow-up)|Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 is a self-report questionnaire of anxiety symptoms, which includes 7 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety symptoms., Study Entry, 5 weeks (mid-intervention), 10 weeks (post-intervention), 16 weeks (long-term follow-up)|Self-Compassion Scale, The Self-Compassion Scale is a self-report questionnaire of self-compassion, which includes 26 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 26-130, with higher scores indicating higher self-compassion., Study Entry, 5 weeks (mid-intervention), 10 weeks (post-intervention), 16 weeks (long-term follow-up)|Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being, meaning and peace subscales, The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being is a self-report questionnaire on meaning and peace, which includes 8 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0-48, with higher scores indicating higher self-reported meaning and peace during chronic illness., Study Entry, 5 weeks (mid-intervention), 10 weeks (post-intervention), 16 weeks (long-term follow-up)
Number of intervention sessions that each consented participant attended, This measure will be calculated as a count of sessions that each consented participant in the MSC-LC intervention attended. It will be used as a metric of acceptability of the intervention., 10 weeks (post-intervention)|Treatment fidelity, This measure will be calculated as a proportion of the number of components within an intervention session that the interventionists delivered (assessed via audio recording) over the number of pre-determined components that they were meant to deliver, per the interventionist manual., Weekly throughout the intervention from study entry to post-intervention (10 weeks)
Lung cancer stigma (i.e., perceived and internalized negative appraisal and devaluation associated with lung cancer) is a pervasive problem experienced by the majority of lung cancer patients. Notably, experiences of lung cancer stigma are strongly associated with poorer quality of life and higher depressive symptoms. Despite these associations, there is a gap in the field regarding empirically supported, patient-focused interventions that target the reduction of lung cancer stigma.

Self-compassion (i.e., directed kindness towards oneself in times of suffering) is a protective psychosocial factor that has been targeted through intervention approaches to reduce shame and self-criticism in non-cancer samples. Additionally, higher self-compassion has been shown to attenuate the relationship between lung cancer stigma and depression, suggesting that fostering self-compassion may be an effective intervention strategy to reduce lung cancer stigma. Mindful Self-Compassion is an empirically supported, 8-week psychosocial intervention demonstrated to increase self-compassion and reduce feelings of shame, distress, depression, and anxiety in non-cancer samples. However, given several anticipated challenges associated with delivering Mindful Self-Compassion to lung cancer patients (e.g., breathing challenges that arise during breath-focused meditations, fatigue that interferes with attending 3-hour sessions), the investigators developed an adapted version of the intervention (Mindful Self-Compassion for Lung Cancer; MSC-LC) that is tailored to the needs of adults diagnosed with lung cancer, addresses delivery challenges, and targets the reduction of lung cancer stigma.

This is a pilot trial examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MSC-LC, compared to waitlist control condition. The central hypothesis is that MSC-LC will be demonstrate high feasibility and acceptability as well as preliminary efficacy in reducing lung cancer stigma and promoting self-compassion.
