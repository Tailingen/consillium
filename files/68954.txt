Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Stage IV Solid Tumors, Lymphoma, or Myeloma
RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and slow the growth of cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interferon alfa in treating patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.
Breast Cancer|Kidney Cancer|Lymphoma|Melanoma|Multiple Myeloma|Sarcoma|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BIOLOGICAL: recombinant interferon alpha-1b|DRUG: IFN
Tolerance and safety as measured by any ≥ Grade IV granulocyte toxicity or any Grade III toxicity thought to be drug related at 1 week after each course, 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Confirm tolerance and safety of interferon alfa-1b (IFN-α1b) in patients with stage IV solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma.
* Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-α1b given daily by subcutaneous injection in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously once daily for at least 1 month. Treatment continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of interferon alfa-1b until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
