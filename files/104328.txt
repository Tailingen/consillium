AZD1775 Plus Carboplatin-Paclitaxel in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) AZD1775 used in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel will have on participants and their cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: AZD1775
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from date of first study treatment to death, progression of disease, or the last follow-up data, whichever comes first. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time from the date for first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of death., Up to 2 years|Duration of Overall Response (OR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control, DCR: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD)., Up to 2 years
