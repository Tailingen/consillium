Wide Excision Alone As Treatment for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast
The purpose of this study is to determine if wide excision (surgical removal) alone is adequate treatment for small, grade 1 or 2 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast.
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast
OTHER: Observation
To determine if patients with DCIS can be effectively treated with wide excision alone., Using information gathered from follow-up physical examinations and mammography to check for recurrence (DCIS or invasive carcinoma in the breast), DCIS patients treated with wide excision alone will be evaluated., TBD-survivorship
To explore whether patients with grade 2 DCIS have a higher breast recurrence than patients with grade 1 DCIS., Using information gathered from follow-up physical examinations and mammography, the exploration of breast recurrences between grade 2 DCIS and grade 1 DCIS patients will be evaluated., TBD-survivorship
* Patients with DCIS are usually treated with the combination of breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy or breast-conserving surgery alone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether localized low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, diagnosed with modern mammography and careful pathologic evaluation, could be treated with wide excision alone (omission of radiation therapy) and result in acceptably low local recurrence rates.
* Follow-up consists of physical examinations at least every 6 months by the surgeon or radiation oncologist. Mammograms of the affected breast will be obtained every 6 months for 5 years and then annually. Mammograms of the unaffected breast will be performed annually.
