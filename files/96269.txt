Effect of Neutrophil Elastase Inhibitor on Lung Injury After Esophagectomy
A neutrophil elastase inhibitor may have effect on suppression of the lung injury after thoransthoracic esophagectomy. The investigators hypothesized that postoperative complication, particularly respiratory complication may be reduced by neutrophil elastase inhibitor after esophagectomy.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: sivelestat sodium hydrate
Pulmonary function, the arterial oxygen pressure, 9 days
Pulmonary function, fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PF ratio), 9 days|Pulmonary function, the duration of mechanical ventilation, 9 days
The aim of this study was to clarify the usefulness of perioperative administration of sivelestat sodium hydrate, a selective inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the pulmonary function, systemic inflammatory response, and the postoperative clinical course following video-assisted thoracoscopic esohpagectomy for esophageal cancer.
