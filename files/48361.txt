UCN-01 and Fludarabine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Lymphoma or Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fludarabine when given with UCN-01 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade lymphoma or leukemia.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
DRUG: 7-hydroxystaurosporine|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of fludarabine when administered with UCN-01 in patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade or indolent lymphoid malignancies.
* Determine, preliminarily, the activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.
* Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fludarabine.

Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3 alone during course 1 and over 36 hours on days 1-2 during courses 2-7. Patients also receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 1 and continuing for up to 5 days during courses 2-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
