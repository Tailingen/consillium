Laboratory Testing for Tie-2 Expressing Monocytes (TEMs) in Blood
Tie-2 expressing monocytes (TEMs) are a specific type of blood cell that are present in healthy individuals and in people with cancer. These cells may play a role in the growth of blood vessels (veins/arteries), and may be particularly important in the growth of blood vessels that supply tumours. Understanding how these cells work may therefore help researchers to develop cancer treatments that starve tumors of their blood supply.

This research study involves an analysis of the behaviour of blood cells in response to different drugs in a test tube. The goal is to develop tests that can then be used to monitor patients treated with drugs that target blood vessel growth.

Characterize the in vitro response of circulating myeloid cells to angiopoeitins-1 and 2 (ANG1 and 2) in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors, This is an observational correlative laboratory protocol in which one tube of blood from healthy volunteers and cancer patients will be collected to perform in vitro stimulation of TEMs with ANG1 and 2 and flow cytometry analysis, which could serve as a biomarker for future ANG directed therapies. The results of this study will contribute to an improved understanding of ANG-TIE2 signaling in TEMs. Furthermore, this study will contribute directly to the development and optimization of protocols that will be applied a separate Phase I NCI trial of AMG 386 and temsirolimus., 1 year
Develop and optimize flow cytometry analyses, This will comprise correlative studies in a separate upcoming Phase I clinical trial., 1 year
