STRatifying Adult DIffuse Lower-grade Gliomas Based on Their VARIed Metabolic Profiles (STRADIVARI Project)
The goal of this observational study is to better characterise lower-grade gliomas from a molecular and metabolic point of view, so to identify further subgroups of these tumours with different behaviour and, possibly, different treatment susceptibility.

Participants of prospective metabolic cohort will be subjected to routine treatment, part of the exceeding tutor material will be subjected to advanced molecular-metabolic analyses to desume their metabolic profile to be then correlated with clinical outcome (progression-free survival, overall survival, response to therapy/progression) and diagnosis (astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma and grade).

Critical enzymes identified from metabolic analyses on the first cohort will be tested on a protein level on a retrospective cohort of patients previously operated and for whom fully available clinical history and pathological material is available in Institutional archive (no need for further intervention on these patients) to see if they actually correlate with clinical outcome.
Lower Grade Glioma
Progression Free Survival (PFS), time from surgery to evidence of radiological progression at MRI, (up to 180 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Time from surgery to tumor-related death, (up to 180 months)
Histological-molecular diagnosis (integration of immunohistochemistry and molecular evaluation of IDH1/2, ATRX and 1p/19q chromosomal deletion), Astrocytoma vs Oligodendroglioma (integration of immunohistochemistry and molecular evaluation of IDH1/2, ATRX and 1p/19q chromosomal deletion), From date of surgery to date of complete diagnosis (weeks)|Tumor Grade at histology and molecular analysis (CDKN2A/B deletion), Tumor grade upon histology and molecular analysis (CDKN2A/B deletion), From surgery to complete history-molecular diagnosis (weeks)
