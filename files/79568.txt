A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of TQ-A3334 Tablets
This is a study to evaluate the tolerance, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single and multiple oral doses of TQ-A3334 and observe the efficacy of TQ-A3334 in combination with anlotinib capsules in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
