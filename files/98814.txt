Comparison With Open and Totally Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
In gastric cancer, laparoscopic gastrectomy is commonly performed in Asian countries. In other regions where tumor incidence is relatively low and patient characteristics are different, developments in this issue have been limited. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the early results for patients who underwent open or laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer in a center in Turkey.

The patients who were operated in Kocaeli Derince Training and Research Hospital between January 2014 and January 2019 consecutively due to gastric cancer were analyzed. The diagnosis was made by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy. Clinical staging was done using contrast computed tomography (CT). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in patients with suspected metastasis.The patients were divided into two groups according to the technique applied (open, laparotomy). The first group (Group 1; n: 30) consisted of patients who underwent open surgery, and the second group (Group 2, n: 30) laparoscopic surgery.
