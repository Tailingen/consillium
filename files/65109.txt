A Study of Grape Seed Extract in Asymptomatic Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients With Rising PSA
Patients will take 150 mg of GSE product by mouth twice daily and will be evaluated every 6 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter for up to one year.

The number of patients with PSA response, PSA response will be defined as an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (PSADT) of 30% (PSADT is the length of time it takes for a PSA to double based on an exponential growth pattern). Patients must have a PSA level of â‰¥ 0.2 at study entry and should have at least three prior PSA values with dates from which to calculate a PSA doubling time., 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
The rate of change of the PSA over time (PSA velocity) for each patient, PSA velocity will be calculated as a change from the first PSA reading, standardized as PSA change per month. PSA Response will be defined as increase in PSADT of 30% (PSADT is the length of time it takes for a PSA to double based on an exponential growth pattern). Biomarkers will be defined as proinflammatory cytokines, lipid and comprehensive metabolic panel in patient serum samples as well as, gut microbiome (measured by by high-throughput16S sequencing), plasma and stool metabolomics (after short and long-term consumption of GSE), and the effects of diet on gut microbiome., 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
Patients will take 150 mg of GSE product by mouth twice daily in the form of 75 mg capsule of Leucoselect Phytosome preparation; total oral dosage is 300 mg GSE per day for one year. Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter for up to one year. PSA measurements will be obtained at these scheduled visits and patients must not have a doubling of their PSA (compared to baseline) by 3 months in order to continue on study. Patients who meet criteria to continue on study will be treated until disease progression or for one year (whichever comes first).
