A Phase 1 Study of ASKG315 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The study is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of ASKG315 as a single agent (Part 1) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: ASKG315
Safety[DLTs、AEs、ECG], 1. Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)
2. Incidence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory abnormalities, and ECG abnormalities, 21days
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics of ASKG315 in subjects., 21days|Area under the concentration time curve (AUC), To evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics of ASKG315 in subjects., 21days|Cytokine, Changes in circulating cytokine levels., 21days|Immunocyte, Changes in immunocyte levels by flow cytometry., 21days
Each part of the study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 28 days), treatment and follow-up. After an initial screening period, ASKG315 or ASKG315 combined with pembrolizumab will be administered once every 3 weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion. The Part 1 dose escalation consists of 6 planned escalation cohorts, with a starting dose of 3 mg. The Part 2 dose escalation consists of 4 planned escalation cohorts.

Part 2 of the study will begin enrolling after Part 1 has successfully and safely dosed all patients in the first two cohorts and followed these patients through the entire DLT period. The starting dose of Part 2 will be determined according to the safety and PK of ASKG315 in Part 1 of the study, but in no case will it exceed the highest dose already safely administered in Part 1 and confirmed as tolerable by the Safety Review Committee in Part 1.
