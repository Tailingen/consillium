Efficacy of Ultrasound-assisted Caudal Epidural Pulsed Radiofrequency for Anal Pain in Cancer Patients,
Our primary goal will be to investigate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound (US)-assisted caudal epidural PRF (pulsed radiofrequency)( stimulation in patients with perineal or anal pain cancer patients using (visual analog scale (VAS) scores from 0 to 10 at the baseline (pretreatment), two, four, and eight weeks; secondary outcomes will be the effects on opioid use and total opioid use in the 24 h, quality of life, patient satisfaction and opioid and intervention related side effects.
