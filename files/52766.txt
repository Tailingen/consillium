Study of The Second-line Treatment of Advanced Gastric / Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma With Envafolimab and Lenvatinib Combined With Paclitaxel-albumin
This study is an open, exploratory clinical study. Eligible patients with advanced second-line gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma signed an informed consent form, were screened for enrollment, and were entered into Group A (non-immune retreatment group-patients who had failed previous first-line treatment with standard chemotherapy) and Group B (immune retreatment-patients who had obtained SD and above with best efficacy of previous first-line treatment with PD-1 antibody) based on whether they had received previous first-line treatment with PD-1 antibody. All patients received a combination of envafolimab and lenvatinib in combination with paclitaxel-albumin and were treated until disease progression, withdrawal of informed consent by the subject, loss to follow-up, and death, where treatment did not exceed 2 years. Clinical oncologic imaging assessments were performed using iRECIST every 8 weeks during treatment; safety assessments were performed using CTCAE 5.0, and adverse events were recorded throughout the study up to 30 days after the end of treatment.
Gastric / Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: envafolimab and lenvatinib combined with paclitaxel-albumin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable lesions achieving a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) criteria., 12 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of participants who achieves a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease(SD)., 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the date that response criteria are first met to the date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause., 20 months|Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse Events (AEs) according to CTCAE v5.0, 12 months
