The ASCEND Study: Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel With LSTA1 (Certepetide) or Placebo in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of the ASCEND clinical trial is to measure the effect of adding LSTA1 (certepetide), compared to placebo, to chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) in patients who have untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study will assess the duration which the cancer remained stable or improved, the number of patients who responded to treatment, overall survival, side effects and quality of life.

DRUG: LSTA1|DRUG: Gemcitabine Injection|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival, Period of time from randomization to the date of first evidence of disease progression, the occurrence of new disease or death from any cause, From date of randomization to 18 months later, or death
Overall Survival, Period of time from randomization to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive, From date of randomization to 18 months later, or death|Objective Tumour Response Rate, The number of participants with documented partial or complete response (PR or CR) divided by the number of participants evaluable for response as defined as per the RECIST version 1.1 criteria, From date of randomization to 18 months later, or death|Patient-reported Outcomes, Completion of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. 30 questions; 28 on a 1-4 scale (Higher scores indicative of poorer quality of life), 2 on a 1-7 scale (higher scores indicative of better health/quality of life)., Completed at baseline, then every 8 weeks from randomization until and at disease progression (to a maximum of 48 months).|Patient-reported Outcomes, Completion of the QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire. 26 questions on a 1-4 scale (Higher scores indicative of poorer quality of life), Completed at baseline, then every 8 weeks from randomization until and at disease progression (to a maximum of 48 months).|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Patient Safety), Record of all adverse events (including SAEs) that patients experience, From date of randomization until 30 days after final treatment visit
