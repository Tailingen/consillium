Post-operative Imaging in High Grade Glioma: is Management Influenced?
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is likely to play an important role in the management of high grade glioma. Appropriate and timely neuroimaging in the follow up period is believed to be crucial in making subsequent management decisions. However, there is a paucity in the literature providing evidence to support this. The aim of this study is to determine whether neuroimaging performed at each component of the patient pathway after initial high grade glioma treatment, actually results in a real change in management (as opposed to a perceived change in management). The main emphasis is on all imaging used at the time of a MDM, however, we will also study specifically dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI.

The study is in the format of Mock MDMs to be compatible with real life decision making. Using retrospective identical information available at the MDM i.e. compiled recent correspondence, histopathological and molecular information, the MDM members (oncology nurse, oncologist, neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, pathologist/molecular scientist) will prospectively determine the patient management with and without the imaging.
