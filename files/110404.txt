A Study of Ocular Toxicity Evaluation and Mitigation During Treatment With Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in Participants With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer With High Folate Receptor-Alpha Expression
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence rate and severity of prespecified mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV)-related ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and assess prophylaxis strategies in all participants (symptomatic and asymptomatic) undergoing prospective ophthalmic evaluation with recurrent ovarian cancer (participants with either platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer \[PSOC\] or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer \[PROC\]) with high folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer|Folate Receptor-Alpha Positive
DRUG: Mirvetuximab Soravtansine|DRUG: Lubricating Eye Drops|DRUG: Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1% eye drops|DRUG: Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution eye drops
Number of Participants With MIRV-related Corneal TEAEs (≥ Grade 2) in Asymptomatic Participants, This endpoint will be assessed in the participants receiving MIRV who are asymptomatic ., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)
Number of Participants With Ocular symptom TEAEs in Participants Using Corticosteroid or Vasoconstricting Eye Drop Primary Prophylaxis, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days|Number of Participants With MIRV-related Corneal TEAEs in Symptomatic Participants, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Number of Participants With Ocular exam TEAEs in Asymptomatic Participants and Symptomatic participants, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Number of Participants With MIRV-related Corneal TEAEs (≥ Grade 2) in Participants Using Corticosteroid or Vasoconstricting Eye Drop Primary Prophylaxis, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Number of Participants with ocular exam TEAEs in Participants using corticosteroid or vasoconstricting eye drop primary prophylaxis, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) Composite Score, At Cycle 5 Day 1 or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of MIRV, Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 through 4 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of MIRV, Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 through 4 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of MIRV, Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 through 4 up to 18 weeks or at the 30-day follow-up visit, whichever is earlier (cycle length = 21 days)
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 ocular adverse event (AE) risk mitigation strategy arms (primary prophylactic steroid eye drops versus primary prophylactic vasoconstricting eye drops).
