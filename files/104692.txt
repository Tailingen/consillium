A Phase I Open-label Study for Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary activity of PT01 administered IV in subjects with advanced malignancies.'
Advanced Solid Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: PT01 (Pegtomarginase)
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) together with the biologically effective dose (BED) of PT01., Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for determination of MTD and/or RP2D. The grading of toxicity is based on the NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria.

Cycle 1 and Beyond, prepose and .5 hour post infusion.|PT01 concentration at the end of a dosing interval, immediately before next administration (Ctrough), the lowest observed concentration., Cycle 0 Day 1: predose PT01 (Hour 0) and at 0.5 (end of infusion), 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168, and 240 hours after the start of the PT01 IV infusion.

Cycle 1 and Beyond, prepose and .5 hour post infusion.|The total clearance of the PT01 from plasma (CL), Cycle 0 Day 1: predose PT01 (Hour 0) and at 0.5 (end of infusion), 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168, and 240 hours after the start of the PT01 IV infusion. Cycle 1 and Beyond, prepose and .5 hour post infusion|Duration of arginine reduction <10% of baseline., Cycle 0 Day 1: predose PT01 (Hour 0) and at 0.5 (end of infusion), 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168, and 240 hours after the start of the PT01 IV infusion.

The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase, both of which include a 28-day Screening Period, Baseline, a Treatment Period (comprised of 28-day cycles with weekly dosing on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), and a Follow-up Period. Unique to the Dose Escalation Phase is the inclusion of Cycle 0 during which a single dose of PT01 will be administered before Cycle 1 for detailed exploration of the PK/PD relationship.

All PT01 IV doses will be administered at the clinical site.
