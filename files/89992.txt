Feasibility Trial of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate giving chemotherapy drugs directly into the abdomen (belly) along with intravenous administration.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma|Uterine Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel, Cisplatin IP
Number of Patients Who Are Able to Receive 6 Cycles of Intraperitoneal Cisplatin Chemotherapy., 3 years
Number of Patients With Dose Reductions or Dose Delays Due to Neuropathy or Toxicity, 3 years
Giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Because ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal and uterine cancer spread in the abdominal cavity, giving chemotherapy drugs by infusion into the abdominal cavity may result in a greater dose of the drugs reaching the tumor cells. Intraperitoneal treatments will be administered through an implantable peritoneal catheter. These catheters are to be inserted into the peritoneal cavity, tunneled through the subcutaneous tissue, and connected to an implantable port, which is placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior, inferior thorax.
