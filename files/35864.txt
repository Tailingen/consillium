Phase II Study of FOLFOXIRI in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer
1. Goals

   The primary goal of this phase II trial is to:

   evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, and Irinotecan in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Biliary tract cancer as first-line chemotherapy

   Secondary goals are to:

   evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) in this population
2. Design The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon two-stage testing procedure
