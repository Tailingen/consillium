Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Low Anterior Resection for Rectal Cancer
Prospective randomized trial comparing robotic versus laparoscopic Low anterior resection for rectal cancer.

Primary endpoint: Compare urinary dysfunction between robotic and laparoscopic approach.
Rectal Neoplasms|Sexual Dysfunction|Urinary Incontinence|Quality of Life
PROCEDURE: Robotic|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic
Urinary dysfunction, Urodynamic test, Change from Before surgery to 3 months after surgery
Sexual dysfunction, Quality of life questionnaire, Change from Before surgery to 3 months after surgery|Post operative outcomes, Post operative complications, Within the first 30 days after the surgical procedure|Costs, Costs in Brazilian currency of each procedure, From the surgical procedure until the last follow up, which will be 24 months or the day of death.
Prospective randomized trial comparing robotic versus laparoscopic Low anterior resection for rectal cancer.

The Aim of the study is to compare two surgical approaches (robotic versus laparoscopic) for rectal cancer treatment regarding functional outcomes (sexual and urinary dysfunctions), quality of life, post operative outcomes and oncologic outcomes.

Patients with the diagnosis of T3 mid and low rectal cancer will be randomized to robotic or laparoscopic procedure after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Quality of life questionnaires and Urodynamic test will be applied before and after the surgical procedures.
