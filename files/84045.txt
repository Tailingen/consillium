Multicentric interventional prospective study with collection of biological samples as part of a routine care research
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tissue sampling|PROCEDURE: Blood sampling
Immunophenotyping of immune infiltrates by flow cytometry, Immunophenotyping analysis by flow cytometry (Cyan, Beckman Coulter): identification of several immune sub-populations (T-B-NK lymphocytes, myeloid and tumor cells); identifications of several receptors and ligands (PD1 / PDL1, Tim-3 / HAVCR2,, CTLA-4, 4-1BB / 4-1BBL, Fas / FasL, TRAIL, OX40 / OX40L, ICOS / ICOSL, CD69, CD25 / CD127, NKp46 / NKp30, NKG2D / NKG2DL, galectin-9, MHC class I and II, B7H3 / B7H6); identification of memory subpopulations (CD45RA / CD27 / CCR7) and, if available, intra-cytoplasmic labeling (CXCR3, CCR6, Granzyme B, KI67, TNFÎ± IFNg, IL-17 and IL-21)., Up yo one year
