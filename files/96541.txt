Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Idelalisib in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (iNHL) or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the 28-day safety and tolerability, and to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of idelalisib in Japanese participants with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

DRUG: Idelalisib
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. TEAEs were defined as 1 or both of the following: 1) Any AEs with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug; and/or 2) Any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug., First dose date up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing TEAEs Related to Idelalisib Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.

If the relevant baseline laboratory value was missing, then any abnormality of at least Grade 1 observed within the time frame specified above was considered treatment-emergent.The most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each participant. Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03 where 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Potentially Life Threatening., First dose date up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants Who Permanently Discontinued Idelalisib Due to a TEAE Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.
