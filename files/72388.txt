Using a Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device to Treat Skin Disorders
This study examines the efficacy of a non-thermal, atmospheric plasma device in the treatment of skin disorders
Actinic Keratosis|Acne/Rosacea|Verruca Plana|Tinea|Molluscum Contagiosum|Bowen's Disease|Warts
DEVICE: Non-thermal, atmospheric plasma to treat skin lesions and acne|DEVICE: Indirect non-thermal, atmospheric plasma to treat hair loss and acne
Clinical improvement, The outcome is the presence or lack of clinical improvement in the investigator's global assessment and reviewing photo-documentation as well as reflectance confocal microscopy study investigator's global assessment and reviewing photo-documentation, 1-12 months
The study uses non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma to treat target conditions. The patients are monitored at set intervals for efficacy and adverse effects using investigator's assessment and imaging techniques
