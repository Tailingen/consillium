Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This phase II trial is studying how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as temsirolimus work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Stage I Multiple Myeloma|Stage II Multiple Myeloma|Stage III Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: temsirolimus|OTHER: pharmacological study|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Proportion of patients with objective overall response rate (PR+CR), Up to 5 years
Progression-free survival, Time from the initial administration of temsirolimus to first documentation of disease progression or death, assessed up to 5 years|Incidence of toxicities, Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with CCI-779.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the presence of PTEN mutation in patients treated with this drug.

IV. Correlate the pharmacokinetics of this drug with response in these patients.

V. Correlate the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug with response in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
