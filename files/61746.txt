Ablatherm Integrated Imaging High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Indication of Low Risk, Localized Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the substantial equivalence of the Ablatherm high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as compared to cryotherapy for the treatment of low risk, localized prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Integrated Imaging High Intensity Focused Ultrasound|DEVICE: Endocare CRYOcare Cryosurgical and Galil Medical CRYO-HIT Systems (cryotherapy)
Attainment achievement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir < 0.5 ng/ml and stability of PSA according to American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) criteria through 24 month follow up without a positive biopsy, Through 24 month period
Achievement of a nadir PSA within 6 months < 0.5 ng/ml, 6 months|Overall survival, defined as time to death due to any cause, From date of treatment until the date of death due to any cause|Disease specific survival, defined as the time to death due to the underlying disease, "From date of treatment until the date of death due to the underlying cause|Change from baseline in the University of California, Los Angeles Quality of Life (UCLA QOL), 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months|Change from baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months
The occurrence of adverse events and device-related adverse events reported, through out study
Primary hypothesis of this clinical investigation is that HIFU with the Ablatherm Integrated Imaging is non-inferior to minimally invasive cryosurgery as an effective treatment method for low risk, localized prostate cancer.
