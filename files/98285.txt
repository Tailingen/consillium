Efficacy and Safety of rhTPO's Prophylactic Treatment of CTIT in Patients With High Risk of Cardiac Injury
To assess the efficacy and safety of an optimised dosing regimen of rhTPO's prophylactic treatment of cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia(CTIT) and to explore the cardioprotective effect of rhTPO in cancer patients with high risk of treatment-induced cardiac injury.
Cancer Treatment Induced Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: rhTPO|DRUG: Control
Proportion of patients whose platelet count is ≥ 75×10^9/L after 2 cycles cancer treatment., Efficacy was defined as treatment without salvage therapy to increase platelet counts., After 2 cycles cancer treatment (month 1.5~month 2, depends on chemotherapy regimen), each cycle is 14, 21 or 28 days
Proportion of patients receiving salvage treatment to increase platelet counts., Salvage treatment including platelet infusion, rhIL-11, etc., during 3 cycles cancer treatment period(each cycle is 14, 21 or 28 days)|Changes in cTnT/cTnI, 1 and 3 months after initial treatment|Changes in NT-proBNP, 1 and 3 months after initial treatment|Changes in LVEF, LVEF will be assessed by echocardiography, 1 and 3 months after initial treatment|Changes in neutrophile granulocyte count, during 3 cycles cancer treatment period(each cycle is 14, 21 or 28 days)|Incidence of adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, from study start date to the end of follow-up, up to 3 months
This is an open-label prospective randomized multicenter study of rhTPO's prophylactic treatment of CTIT in patients receiving chemotherapy at high risk of cardiac injury. Adult cancer patients with high risk of cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia and cardiac injury were enrolled. Patients will be randomised into the rhTPO treatment group or non-rhTPO treatment group with a 2:1 ratio. The patients in rhTPO group will receive rhTPO 300U/kg/d subcutaneous injection for 5 days per cycle and total 3 cycles. The primary endpoint is to observe the improvement of platelet count by rhTPO during 3 cycles treatment period.
