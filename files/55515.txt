Evaluating Ivonescimab as a Potential Treatment for Pleural Mesothelioma Patients Whose Cancer Has Returned After Previous Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy
Multicentre, open-label, single arm phase II study for patients with PM previously treated by immunotherapy and standard chemotherapy. 38 patients will be given second or third-line treatment with ivonescimab 20mg/kg every 3 weeks.

An estimated 38 patients will be enrolled in approximately 20 centres. Patients will be treated for a maximum of 2 years, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or another discontinuation criterion is met.

The null hypothesis is disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks ≤ 30%. The alternative hypothesis is DCR ≥ 55% at 12 weeks.
Pleural Mesotheliomas
DRUG: Ivonescimab
To assess the therapeutic value of the bispecific antibody anti-VEGF / anti-PD-1 ivonescimab as 2nd/3rd line treatment in relapsing PM patients, The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted in all eligible patients, based on the disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks according to mRECIST 1.1 for mesothelioma, which was defined as the proportion of patients with compete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks as assessed by the independent review committtee., 12 weeks after start of treatment.
Tolerance, safety of treatment, Incidence, nature and severity of AEs, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)., From time of informed consent through treatment period and up to 90 days post last dose of study treatment (maximum of 2 years and 3 months).|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of inclusion to the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by Investigator review and review of radiographic disease assessments by IRC as per mRECIST v1.1 for mesothelioma, or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had a PFS event at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new anticancer therapy, PFS is censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment., At progression, up to 2 years after start of treatment.|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of inclusion to the date of death due to any cause. If a death has not been observed by the date of the analysis cut-off, OS will be censored at the date of last contact., Around 45 months.|Best response rate, Best response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a best response of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by Investigator review and review of radiographic disease assessments by IRC as per mRECIST v1.1 for mesothelioma., At progression, up to 2 years after start of treatment.|Duration of response, DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first response (CR or PR) to the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by Investigator review and review of radiographic disease assessments by IRC as per mRECIST v1.1 for mesothelioma, or death due to any cause. If a patient with a CR or PR has neither progressed nor died at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new anticancer therapy, the patient will be censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment. DOR will be calculated for patients who have achieved a confirmed overall response (i.e. CR or PR)., At progression, up to 2 years after start of treatment.
