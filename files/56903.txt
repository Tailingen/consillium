Early Pulmonary Dysfunction in Childhood Cancer Patients
This longitudinal, prospective, multicentre study is to monitor lung function prospectively in childhood cancer patients after diagnosis. The impact of cancer treatment on pulmonary dysfunction non-invasively using lung function, lung imaging and breath analysis as well as clinical symptoms using a questionnaire will be assessed at different time points.
Pulmonary Dysfunction
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Lung function measurements|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breath Analysis|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)|OTHER: Standardized interview to assess respiratory symptoms|OTHER: Data collection for assessment of clinical parameters and cumulative doses to chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and HSCT|OTHER: Collection of genetic samples
