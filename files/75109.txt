Induction Cisplatin and Capecitabine Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To prospectively evaluate the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and capecitabine followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: cisplatin, capecitabine
PFS (progression free survival), progression free survival, From date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.
All patients received 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy:cisplatin 80mg/m2, day 1; oral capecitabine 1000mg/m2 twice daily from day1-14, repeated every 3 weeks followed by concomitant cisplatin (100mg/m2,day1,every 3 weeks) for a total of 2 cycles with radiotherapy. Intensity-modified radiotherapy (IMRT) were used in all patients with the total dose and dose/fraction (Fr) as follows: PTV (planned target volume)_1:70 grays (Gy) at 2 Gy/ Fr, PTV_2:63 Gy at 1.8 Gy/ Fr, PTV_3:56 Gy at 1.6 Gy/ Fr;5 fractions per week. Tumor response was evaluated after 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy and 16 weeks following completion of CCRT according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1). All toxicities were gauged based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE 4.03).
