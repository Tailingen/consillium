Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization
The primary objective of the study is to use high throughput molecular analysis (CGH Array and sequencing) to treat patients with metastatic cancer with targeted therapeutics in order to improve the progression free survival compared to the previous treatment line.

The secondary objectives are to investigate clinical practical feasibility of such technics, to potentially improve the overall survival of patients and to describe molecular portrait of Phase 1 candidates.
Metastatic Solid Tumors (Any Localization)
PROCEDURE: Tumoral biopsy
Progression free survival (PFS) using a targeted treatment selected by molecular profiling compared to the PFS for the most recent regimen, Progression according to RECIST criteria or clinical progression or death of any cause, From date of start of targeted treatment oriented by MOSCATO until the date of first progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year
Number of patient who received a targeted treatment oriented by molecular profiling, Number of patient who received a targeted treatment oriented by molecular profiling, From the start to the end of enrollment, up to 3 years|Progression free Survival, Overall Survival and Response Rate, Comparison of Progression Free Survival, Overall Survival and Response Rate between patients with targeted treatment and others enrolled patients., Until progression, up to 1 year
