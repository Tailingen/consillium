Antiangiogenic Peptide Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patient With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess toxicities of angiogenic peptide vaccine therapy in treating HLA-A\*2402 restricted patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: antiangiogenic paptide vaccine
Toxicities as assessed by NCI-CACAE ver3, 3 months
Differences of peptide specific CTL response in vitro among sequence of peptide vaccine administration, 3 months|CD8 population, 3 months|Change in level of regulatory T cells, 3 months|Objective response rate, 1 year|Feasibility, 1 year|Survival, 1 year
It has been required to develop new treatment modalities for patients with advanced heptatocellular carcinoma. Immunotherapy is one of the encouraging modalities for patients. We have to assess its toxicities, clinical response and immune responsiveness.
