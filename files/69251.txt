Tablet-based Mobile Health Ultrasound for Point-of-care Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Nigeria
The purpose of this study is to train Nigerian radiologists to perform ultrasound-guided breast biopsies on women that present to the hospital with a suspicious breast mass. Before performing biopsies on patients, the Nigerian radiologists will have already successfully completed a competency-based mobile health ultrasound-guided breast biopsy-training program. This program, developed by experts in Nigeria and the United States of America, certifies that they have the skills required to safely perform these biopsies on patients.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: US-guided breast biopsy|OTHER: Ultrasound-guided breast biopsy training program
Accuracy of US-guided breast biopsy in Nigeria compared to reference standard surgical excision, US-guided breast biopsies accuracy measurements will be reported using surgical pathology as the reference standard. Specifically we will report accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity., 12 months
Complication rates from US-guided breast biopsy compared to reference values reported in the literature., To determine if the complication rate of US-guided breast biopsies performed by the trained Nigerian radiologists is equivalent to reference values reported in the literature., 12 months
