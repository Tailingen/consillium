Observation Study of Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Esophageal Cancer Treated With Chemo-Radiation Followed by Surgery
Patients on this observation study must have planned treatment regimen with concurrent CRT followed by planned surgery, which is considered as standard of care for their disease. The total radiation dose will be 50.4 Gy in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy for esophageal cancer and 60 Gy in daily fraction of 2 Gy for non-small cell lung cancer. The concurrent chemo regimen will carboplatin-paclitaxel managed by the treating medical oncologist. Patients are planned to receive surgery at approximately 6 to 9 weeks (maximum 12 weeks post-CRT) after finishing CRT with surgical aspects determined by the treating surgical oncologist.

Patients on this observation study will donate their blood samples within 4 weeks before initiating CRT, within 1 week before completing CRT, 1 month after CRT, and 1 month after surgery (or 3 months after CRT if surgery is not done for any reason). They are also requested to fill out questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-30, EORTC QLQ-OES18, and Pain Scale as attached) prior to CRT, weekly during CRT, 1 month after CRT, 1 month after surgery (or 3 months after CRT if surgery is not done for any reason), and 6 months after CRT. Any patients with incomplete treatment will have samples collected up to the point where they discontinue. The specimen collection, handling and processing will be done by Protocol Support Lab (PSL) at Fox Chase Cancer Center under the directions of the Director, R. Katherine Alpaugh, PhD, following the procedures outlined in PSL lab manual. The patients in this observation study will be asked to donate a tissue specimen after the definitive surgery for investigation.

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Serum inflammation markers, Serum inflammation markers will be analyzed that will serve as the control for the parallel study RT-101. In the 7 month period the blood will be drawn once during the following months - 1, 2,3, 7, 7 months
Quality of life and pain, Quality of life will be assessed in the form of surveys which reveal the ability to complete daily activities the pain level of the patient. During the study the surveys will be conducted in the following months- month1, month 2 (every week that is 4 times), month 3, month 7 and month 9. If there are delays due to toxicities the survey collection timelines can shift and the last survey could be collected up to 12 months. The number of surveys collected will be the same., 1 year
