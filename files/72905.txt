Fenretinide in Treating Patients With Cervical Neoplasia
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention uses drugs to try and prevent development of cancer. Fenretinide may be effective in treating cervical neoplasia and preventing cervical cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fenretinide to placebo in treating patients with cervical neoplasia.
Cervical Cancer|Precancerous Condition
DRUG: Fenretinide|OTHER: Placebo
Efficacy of Fenretinide at Regressing CIN, 6 months
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide; 4-HPR) at regressing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). II. Document the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of 4-HPR in women with CIN.

OUTLINE: This is a double blinded study. Patients are randomized to receive either fenretinide or placebo. Patients are administered fenretinide or a placebo by mouth (PO) daily for 6 months with 3 days of rest every month. Patients undergo colposcopy, colpophotography, and Pap smears at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients undergo cervical biopsy at 6 and 12 months to assess changes.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 84-100 patients will be accrued.
