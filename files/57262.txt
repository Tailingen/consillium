Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of Varian ProBeam Proton Therapy Equipment in the Treatment of Solid Tumors
This study is a clinical trial of prospective, single-arm objective performance criteria. This trial will be conducted in clinical trial sites with a total of 47 subjects enrolled. All of subjects will be treated with radiation therapy using the medical device Varian ProBeam Proton Therapy System (ProBeam), aim to compare the data with objective performance criteria (OPC) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ProBeam radiotherapy system for oncology patients, providing a clinical basis for the medical device registration.

tumor disease control rate reaches the objective performance criteria, After treatment, CR, PR, SD is considered disease control; Percentage of subjects who developed disease control 3 months after the end of the last radiotherapy session., 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|CTCAE level 3 toxic reaction ratio is lower than the acceptable value, The proportion of subjects whose toxicity reaction is level 3 during the clinical trial period. The researchers record AE that appeared during the clinical trial cycle and grade it according to CTCAE 5.0, started from subject enrollment to 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment, up to 5 months|CTCAE level 4 and 5 toxic reaction ratio is acceptable value, The proportion of subjects with toxic reactions of levels 4 and 5 during the clinical trial period.The researchers record AE that appeared during the clinical trial cycle and grade it according to CTCAE 5.0), the entire clinical trial ( until 3 months after last treatment)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The appearance of CR or PR after treatment is considered objective response, Percentage of subjects who experienced objective response at each point in time after the end of the last treatment, screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of the tumor's first assessment as CR or PR, until the first assessment of PD or death due to any cause., screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|Disease Control Rate (DCR), CR, PR, SD for disease control after treatment, screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|tumor markers (if applicable), Tumor-specific symptoms, Tumor markers are examined and the researchers determine the clinical significance of reporting changes in tumor markers (before and after radiation therapy). The symptoms may be recorded according to the disease, and the researchers determine the clinical significance of reporting symptoms (before and after radiation therapy), screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|actual situation of Product usability evaluation (ProBeam system, Oncology Information system (OIS), Treatment plan system (Eclipse)), Researchers using the appropriate functions scored according to the Likert scale and collected open questions to evaluate the comprehensive feeling of ease of use during treatment., screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|CTCAE level 1 and 2 toxic reaction ratio, Adverse Events (AE) rate, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) rate, The proportion of subjects who had toxic reactions of levels 1 and 2 during the clinical trial period.The researchers record AE that appeared during the clinical trial cycle and grade it according to CTCAE 5.0, screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|lab test, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade, Conduct a laboratory examination and the researchers will judge the clinically significant changes in the reporting laboratory indicators. ECOG physical condition grading assessment, and the researchers judge the report of the results clinical significance of the change., screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment|tumor recurrence rate, The rate of tumor recurrence is the ratio of the number of subjects who have relapsed to the total number of subjects. The CT or MRI imaging changes of tumors before and after treatment will be evaluated by an imaging review team based on RECIST 1.1, screening, 1 months ± 7 days, 2 months ± 7 days, 3 months ± 7 days after the last treatment
Oncology patients, including tumors of the nervous system, head and neck, chest, abdomen, spine, pelvic cavity, limbs and other tumors. The screening period from informed consent to enrollment is expected to be 4 weeks, while the treatment period is 1 to 8 weeks. The period after the last treatment is divided into short-term follow-up and long-term follow-up, in which short-term follow-up will be 3 months after the end of the last treatment. Total expected participation for each subject from screening to the completion of short-term follow-up is a maximum duration of 12 weeks + 3 months. Long-term follow-up continues after the end of short-term follow-up until the 5th year after the end of the last radiotherapy session.
