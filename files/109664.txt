Maintenance Bevacizumab or Observation After Taxane Based First Line Chemotherapy In Metastatic Breast Cancer
Investigators propose to assess,the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events)of bevacizumab (Avastin) when combined with standard chemotherapy as first line treatment of patients with metastatic Breast Cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which administration was every 2 or 3 weeks, Every 2 or 3 weeks up to 12 or 18 weeks
Number of Participants with Response Rate, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which the disease evaluation was performed every 3 or 6 weeks, Disease evaluation at Week 3 or at week 6|Percentage of Patients with Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Patients Overall Survival, 1 year
Nowadays in clinical practice patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer often receive taxane-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel) in combination with bevacizumab as it has been shown to increase progression-free survival. There is currently minimal information whether bevacizumab should be given as maintenance therapy after discontinuation of chemotherapy.
