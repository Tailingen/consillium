Pilot Study for the Evaluation of the Efficacy of Vaccination With Autologous Tumor Cells Plus Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) - in - Adjuvant, Followed by Systemic Low-dose-interleukin-2 (IL-2) Administration, in Patients With High Risk Melanoma
This study is an open-label, pilot study of an autologous tumor cell vaccine.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: autologous tumor cells plus GM-CSF-in Adjuvant
Cytotoxic T-cell response to autologous tumor (as measured by staining assay)
Cytotoxic T-cell response to defined melanoma antigens. 1: Activation antigen expression by lymph node T-cells 2: Delayed-type hypersensitivity response to autologous tumor cells. 3: Antibody response to autologous tumor cells.
Regimen: A vaccine comprising autologous melanoma cells plus GM-CSF in-adjuvant will be administered intradermally at a single dose. Subjects will be vaccinated over at least a 6 week period (at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), with responders vaccinated every 4 weeks thereafter for a maximum of 9 vaccinations (up to week 18). Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 will also be administered daily for 6 weeks following the second vaccination at week 1.

Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also receive an additional set of 3 vaccinations in a different site, the response to which will be evaluated at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy methods.
