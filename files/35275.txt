Evaluation of VagiVitalÂ® for Treatment of Vaginal Atrophy
An open study to evaluate the ability of VagiVital in reducing the severity of moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy for women under treatment on adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Vaginal pH and a self-assessment of the symptoms will be assessed. The treatment consists of administration of intravaginal gel from an applicator filled from a tube, once daily for 12 weeks. All participants will self- administer the intravaginal gel once daily for 12 weeks.

DEVICE: Vagivital
Change in severity of VA symptom, Change from baseline to Week 12 in severity of VA symptom (vaginal irritation and itching, dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, dysuria or presence of vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity) that has been self-identified by the subject as being the most bothersome to her.The VA Symptoms are graded from 0-3, where 0 = none and 3 = severe, 12 weeks

Management of breast cancer involves systematic therapies including chemotherapy and endocrine therapy which can lead to vaginal atrophy (VA), caused by decreased levels of circulating estrogen to urinary and vaginal receptors. Due to the reduced estrogen production, less vaginal fluid is produced within the vagina and the mucosa becomes thinner and more fragile. This group of patients can not use estrogen treatment to reduce the symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

A previous study showed a significant reduction in the severity of the most bothersome VA symptoms and vaginal pH was improved (decreased) as well as increased percentage of superficial cells over a 12 week treatment period with Vagivital.

In this study all participants will self- administer the intravaginal gel once daily for 12 weeks.
