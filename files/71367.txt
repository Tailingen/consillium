BrUOG L301 With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Bone Metastases
In this study patient's will receive the medicine Xofigo which is a radioactive drug that is FDA approved to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bones. Xofigo has not previously been tested to treat lung cancer that has spread to the bones. Your doctors are studying the effects, good and bad, of Xofigo when used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the bones.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Bone Metastatses
BIOLOGICAL: Xofigo
Number of Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSE) in Patients Receiving Xofigo With NSCLC and Bone Metastases, Number of Participants with Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSE) Receiving Xofigo With NSCLC and Bone Metastases, Approximately every 2 months for up to a year
Progression-free Survival of Patients With NSCLC and Bone Metastases and Stable or Responding Disease After Front-line Chemotherapy Treated With Xofigo, To measure progression-free survival of patients with NSCLC and bone metastases and stable or responding disease after front-line chemotherapy treated with Xofigo. Post 1 year of follow up the number of patients that remain stable or responding, During treatment (6 cycles, 1 cycle=4 weeks) and through 1 year post treatment|Overall Survival of Patients With NSCLC and Bone Metastases and Stable or Responding Disease After Front-line Chemotherapy Treated With Xofigo, To measure overall survival of patients with NSCLC and bone metastases and stable or responding disease after front-line chemotherapy treated with Xofigo, During treatment (6 cycles, 1 cycle=4 weeks) and through 1 year post treatment

Xofigo has not previously been tested to treat lung cancer that has spread to the bones. Your doctors are studying the effects, good and bad, of Xofigo when used to treat lung cancer that has spread to the bones. Your doctors will also be evaluating changes in health related quality of life using the EORC QL-C20 and QOL-BM22 questionnaires. They will also evaluate the impact of treatment on the Alkaline phosphate levels (by way of lab draws) in patients and measure the progression free survival and overall survival of patients with stable or responding disease after the front line chemotherapy treated with Xofigo.
