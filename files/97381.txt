Capivasertib+Fulvestrant asTreatment for Locally Advanced(Inoperable) or Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer in Chinese Patients
This is a multi-center, two-cohorts, phase IIIb study of Capivasertib+Fulvestrant in HR+/HER2-ABC who had disease recurrence/progression following 1-2L endocrine therapy.

The Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of capi+ful by assessment of TFST (Time to first subsequent treatment) in cohort1.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capivasertib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Time to first subsequent treatment（TFST） in cohort1, To assess the efficacy of capi+ful by assessment of TFST (Time to first subsequent treatment) in cohort 1, From the first dose of study intervention to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent therapy after discontinuation of study intervention, or death in Cohort 1, up to approximately 2 years
Progression-free survival（PFS）, To assess the efficacy of capi+ful by assessment of PFS in Cohort1 and Cohort2, From the first dose of study intervention until the date of objective disease progression or death (by anycause in the absence of progression), up to approximately 2 years|Time to first subsequent treatment（TFST） in cohort2, To assess the efficacy of capi+ful by assessment of TFST in cohort2, From the first dose of study intervention to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent therapy after discontinuation of study intervention, or death in Cohort 2, up to approximately 2 years|Number of participants with AEs/SAEs, To assess the safety and tolerability of capivasertib + fulvestrant in cohort1 and cohort2, From time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-upperiod after discontinuation of study drug, up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate（ ORR）, To assess the efficacy of capi+ful by assessment of ORR in Cohort1 and Cohort2, Up to approximately 2 years
This study will enroll 560 patients in 2 cohorts . Cohort1 will include patients without prior fulvestrant treated and Cohort2 will include patients who received fulvestrant as the first-line treatment and progression ≥6 months after the first dosing of fulvestrant. Approximately 400 patients will be enrolled in Cohort1 and 160 patients will be enrolled in Cohort2.

All patients will receive weekly capivasertib (400 mg, oral, twice daily; 4 days on and 3 days off) and fulvestrant (at the approved dose regimen \[500 mg intramuscular injections on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 3 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1, Week 1 of each cycle thereafter\]). All patients will attend a screening visit a maximum of 28 days prior to the start of study treatment.
