Determination of Cetuximab Versus Cisplatin Early and Late Toxicity Events in HPV+ OPSCC
Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) incidence is increasing rapidly in the developed world. This has been attributed to a rise in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV+OPSCC is considered a distinct disease entity, affecting younger patients and has a good prognosis following treatment. Subsequently, patients can live with the considerable side effects for several decades.

Radiotherapy and cetuximab (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-inhibitor) have demonstrated similar efficacy to 'platin' chemoradiotherapy (current standard treatment containing platinum-based compounds) in head and neck cancer, but is potentially less toxic.

Results of this trial will be used to determine the optimum treatment of this debilitating cancer, with the primary aim of decreasing toxicity and improving quality of life for HPV+OPSCC patients.
Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Cetuximab
Compare severe (acute and late) toxicity (Grade 3-5) caused by cetuximab and radiotherapy to that caused by cisplatin and radiotherapy., Up to two years after end of treatment.
Overall number of events of acute severe toxicity between treatment arms., Up to and including three months after end of treatment.|Overall number of events of late severe toxicity between treatment arms., From three months up to two years after end of treatment.|Quality of life outcomes assessed by EORTC QLQ C30 and HN35 between the two treatment arms., Baseline, end of treatment, and 3, 6, 12 & 24 months after end of treatment.|Effect on swallowing of the two treatment arms (assessed by MDADI and by PEG or RIG utilisation rate at 1 and 2 years)., Baseline, end of treatment, and 3, 6, 12 & 24 months after end of treatment.|Cost-effectiveness of the two treatment arms (assessed by EuroQoL-5D)., Questionnaires completed at the following time points: Baseline, end of treatment, and 3, 6, 12 \& 24 months after end of treatment., Up to two years after end of treatment.|Overall survival and recurrence between the two arms., Up to two years after end of treatment.
