Suction Drain Versus the Use of Adaptive Skin Sutures After Mastectomy ± Axillary Lymphadenectomy; a Prospective Randomised Study
The objective of this prospective randomized study is to perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the insertion of traditional suction drains (Arm: Suction drain) versus the application of absorbable adaptive sutures (Arm: Adaptive suture) following simplex mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy in the light of the total volume of withdrawn serum from wound cavity, the extent of early postoperative analgesic requirements and quality of life.
in Situ Breast Cancer|Invasive Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Insertion of suction drain(s) following mastectomy|PROCEDURE: Adaptive skin sutures.
Total amount of sera withdrawn from the wound cavity, By each follow-up visit within the indicated time frame, the punctuated serum is collected and its volume is measured by a measuring cylinder acquired from the Pharmacy Department and data is recorded. At the end of the follow-up period, the total amount of serum (mL) is documented., 4 weeks
Extent of early postoperative analgesic requirements, Assessment of analgesic consumption to achieve adequate pain relief for each patient. Pain relief is carried out according to institutional protocol and includes: diclofenac sodium, diclofenac sodium + orphenadrine, nalbuphine, metamizole sodium, paracetamole, tramadole., 4 days|Number of punctions following the removal of suction drain, and total volume of punctuated seroma (mL), 4 weeks|Rate of local wound complications., 4 weeks|Assessment of quality of life in the early postoperative period, Using EORTC QoL BR23, weekly for 4 weeks following surgery., 4 weeks|Mobility of the shoulder on the side of the operated side, Assessing shoulder motion on the 1st postoperative day, then weekly for 4 weeks.

Abduction 1: 0°- 45° Abduction 2: 45° - 90° Abduction 3: 90° - 135° Abduction 4: 135° - 180°, 4 weeks|Cost analysis, Suction drain, suction flask, syringes, number of patient-doctor consultations, 4 weeks
