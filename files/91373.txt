A Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus in Combination With Cemiplimab for Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and safety/efficacy evaluation trial of Pexa-Vec plus Cemiplimab in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The trial consists of a dose-escalation stage, where the maximum feasible dose of Pexa-Vec in combination with Cemiplimab will be determined, followed by an expansion stage. During the expansion patients will receive Cemiplimab alone or in combination with Pexa-Vec, which will be administered either through intravenous (IV) or intratumoral (IT) injection.

Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) / Maximum feasible dose (MFD), MTD/MFD of Pexa-Vec administered by IV infusion in combination with Cemiplimab, 36 days after first treatment|Severity and frequency of adverse events to determine safety of Pexa-Vec administered by IV infusions or IT injections in combination with IV Cemiplimab, Safety will be determined by assessing the severity and frequency of adverse events and laboratory toxicity using CTCAE v4.03, From date of first treatment until 28 days after last treatment|Overall response rate, Evaluate anti-tumor activity and efficacy of IV or IT Pexa-Vec combined with IV Cemiplimab with respect to overall response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), Every 9 weeks, then every 12 weeks after 1 year until date of first documented progression, up to 72 months
