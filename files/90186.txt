U87 CART in Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a single center, open-label, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of U87 CART in treating advanced solid tumor .
Pancreatic Cancer|Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: U87 CAR-T
Incidence of Adverse events after U87 CAR-T cells infusion [Safety and Tolerability], Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0) Dose-limiting toxicity after U87 CAR-T cells infusion., 28 days post administration of CAR-T-cells
Disease control rate (DCR) of U87 CAR-T cells treatment in advanced solid tumor. [Effectiveness], Disease control rate: including CR, PR and SD(Assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Objective response rate (ORR) of U87 CAR-T cells treatment in advanced solid tumor. [Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：CR、PR(Assessed based on RECIST1.1 criteria), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Duration of Response (DOR) of U87 CAR-T cells treatment in advanced solid tumot[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Progress-free survival(PFS) of U87 CAR-T cells treatment in advanced solid tumor[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first U87 CAR-T cells infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression(Assessed based on RECIST1.1 ） criteria), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Overall survival(OS) of U87 CAR-T cells treatment in advanced solid tumor [Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first U87 CAR-T cells infusion to death from any cause (Assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, Peak value of eripheral blood (Cmax), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, Area under the eripheral blood concentration versus time curve (AUC), 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics of U87 CAR-T cells, Time of peak value, 2 years post CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacodynamics of U87 CAR-T cells, Concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines such as IL-6, IFN γ, IL-2, TNFα, ferritin and CRP at each time point, 2 years post CAR T cell infusion
Following consent, patients must have tumor tissue evaluated by IHC assay. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (U87). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive preconditioning prior to U87 infusion. All subjects will be asked to continue to undergo long-term gene safety follow-up.
