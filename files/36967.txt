PD1 and PARP for Maintenance Therapy in NSLLC
PARP inhibitor and PD1 in lung squamous cell carcinoma The current study will compare PD1 plus maintenance PARP for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The study's 2 primary hypotheses are: respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent clinical review (BICR).

Overall survival (OS).
Lung Cancer
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor|DRUG: PARP inhibitor
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Progression-free Survival is the time from the date of randomization until either documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years
This study has 2 phases: an Induction Phase (4 Cycles) and a Maintenance Phase (Up to 31 cycles ). In the Induction Phase, participants receive pd1 plus carboplatin plus a taxane (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel). In the Maintenance Phase, participants with a partial or complete disease response or with stable disease after completing four cycles of induction therapy and who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive PD1 plus maintenance PAPR. In the Maintenance Phase, participants randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab for up to 31 cycles plus maintenance until centrally verified progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicities, or physician decision."
