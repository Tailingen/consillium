Phase I-II Study With Tumor Molecular Pharmacodynamic (MPD) Evaluation and Pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in Patients Suffering Metastatic Melanoma
An open label multicentre, phase I-II study with tumour molecular pharmacodynamics (MPD) evaluation and pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 added to vemurafenib in patients suffering metastatic melanoma with BR.

The main objective is to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PD-0332991 when added to standard vemurafenib therapy (960 mg BID). The estimated MTD is defined as the dose of PD-0332991 combined with vemurafenib that will be associated with a prespecified proportion of patients experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), ie, 1/3.
Melanoma BRAF V600E/K Mutated|CDNKN2A Loss Defined
DRUG: PD- 0332991
Occurrence within the first 2 cycles of treatment of a DLT, DLTs, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations will be determined as follows:

* Any grade 3 or more non-haematological toxicity excluding:
* Grade 3 asymptomatic increase in liver function tests (AST, ALT, ALP) reversible within 7 days for subjects without liver involvement, or grade 4 for subjects with liver involvement.
* Grade 3 vomiting if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy (e.g. 5HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids).
* Grade 3 diarrhoeas if encountered despite adequate and optimal anti diarrhoea therapy.
* Confirmed grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc \>500 msec) that persists after correction of other possible causes such as electrolyte imbalance
* Grade 4 hyperlipidemia if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy.
* Any grade 4 neutropenia of \> 5 days duration, or febrile neutropenia lasting for more than 1 day.
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia \> 1 day, or grade 3 with bleeding., 42 Days
Efficacy, Occurrence of clinical benefit (defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or stable disease (SD)) and progressive disease based on the best overall response which depends on the tumour evaluations assessed using RECIST at the end of each 2 cycles., 42 Days|1 year survival rate, survival, 1 year|Tolerance, Occurrence of clinically significant changes in a laboratory parameter and/or vital signs judged to be related to the trial medication within the first 6 months., 6 months
Pharmacodynamic, * Changes from baseline of ANC and platelet levels
* Efficiency on the cell-cycle machinery and proliferation (tumor sample)
* Induction of senescence: will be evaluated using the senescence Î²-Galactosidase assay (Cell Signaling Technology)
* Induction of apoptosis: will be performed using TUNEL staining with the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore)., 42 days
