A Study of Lapatinib in Combination With Everolimus in Patients With Advanced, Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if lapatinib, an agent that targets a protein, called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells in combination with everolimus, an agent that targets a protein in the cancer cell, called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is effective in metastatic triple negative breast cancers that are no longer controlled by standard chemotherapy.

DRUG: Lapatinib and Everolimus
Overall Response Rate Will Measured Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria. Tumor Assessment for All Lesions Must be Performed Every Eight Weeks While on Study by CT Scan., Tumor assessment for all lesions must be performed by CT scan every 8 weeks while on study.|The Safety and Toxicity of the Combination Therapy of Lapatinib and Everolimus Will be Monitored Using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v. 3.0. The Incidence of Any Grade 3 or 4 Toxicities Will be Analyzed., Safety assessments will be performed every four weeks while the patient remains on study.
