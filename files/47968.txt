A Clinical Study of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objectives Phase Ib To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy for advanced solid tumors; and to explore the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy for advanced solid tumors.

Phase IIa To further evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives Phase Ib To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Purinostat Mesylate Monotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors; To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors; To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.

Phase IIa To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy for advanced solid tumors.

To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Purinostat Mesylate in combination therapy for advanced solid tumors.

Exploratory Objectives To assess the pharmacodynamic characteristics in Purinostat Mesylate combination therapy for advanced solid tumors.
