Study of Ombrabulin in Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Treated With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel
Primary Objective:

- To demonstrate an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for Ombrabulin versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

Secondary Objectives:

* To compare the overall survival (OS) between the 2 treatment arms
* To compare the objective response rate (RR) between the 2 treatment arms
Ovarian Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: Ombrabulin (AVE8062)|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival (PFS), approximately 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (RR), approximately 24 months
Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. A minimum of 6 cycles of the combined therapies should be administered, unless progression occurs before or safety reasons cause the discontinuation of one or two drugs of the combination therapies. In case of no progression, it will be investigator's decision to continue or not the study treatment after 6 cycles according to his clinical practice.
