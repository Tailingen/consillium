Cetuximab in Third Line for Mutant APC, TP53 and RAS Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
A prospective, multi-center, phase II study of 21 patients to evaluate the efficacy of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, Cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harboring Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), tumor protein p53 (TP53) and RAS mutations.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Evaluate the PFS among patients treated with cetuximab in APC, TP53 and RAS mutated refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

PFS will be measured from the date of first dose of study drug until the first documented radiographic evidence of disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) criteria 1.1, clinical progression per investigator judgement, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause.

Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is a \>=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions.

Disease progression by RECIST 1.1 is PD., PFS will be measured from the date of first dose of study drug until first documented clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression by RECIST 1.1, clinical progression, start of new therapy or death. Estimated assessment at 6 months.
Overall Survival (OS)., Evaluate the overall survival (OS) among patients treated with cetuximab in APC, TP53 and RAS mutated refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

Upon discontinuation of study therapy, subjects will be followed for survival from the date of study therapy initiation until death, end of the study, or subject withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first., OS was measured from the date of first dose of study drug until death from any cause (up to 223 days)
