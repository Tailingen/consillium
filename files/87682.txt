N-803 and PD-L1 t-haNK Combined With Bevacizumab for Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma
This is a phase 2 open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of N-803 and PD-L1 t-haNK when combined with Bevacizumab in subjects with recurrent or progressive GBM.

Participants will receive N-803 subcutaneously (SC), PD-L1 t-haNK intravenously (IV), and Bevacizumab IV combination therapy.

Treatment for all enrolled participants will consist of repeated cycles of 28 days for a maximum treatment period of 76 weeks (19 cycles). Treatment will be administered on days 1 and day 15 of each cycle. Treatment will be discontinued if the participant reports unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the participant's best interest to continue treatment, or the participant has confirmed progressive disease by iRANO, unless the participant is potentially deriving benefit per Investigator's assessment. Participants will be followed for collection of survival status every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) for the first 2 years, then yearly thereafter.

The treating investigator will assess each component of the Hematology panel and determine if each result is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and Day 15 and at the end of treatment study visit.|Incidence of clinically significant changes in Urinalysis., Checking the appearance, concentration and content of urine for any abnormalities. Each clinical site will use their local laboratory upper normal limit (UNL) range. The treating investigator will assess each component of the urinalysis and determine if each result is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and Day 15 and at the end of treatment study visit.|12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), Perform 12-lead ECG as safety monitoring measurement. The parameters to be assessed for each one are the following: QT Interval, QTc Interval, QTcB Interval, QTcF Interval, PR Interval, QRS Duration and RR Interval with the unit in msec., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and each subsequent Cycle Day1 through to the end of treatment study visit.|Incidence of clinically significant changes in Temperature, Temperature measured in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and for any abnormalities. Each site will assess to determine if temperature is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2 on days 1, 2 and 15, followed by each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and 15 and on the end of treatment study visit.|Incidence of clinically significant changes in Heart Rate, Heart rate measured in beats/minute.

Each site will assess to determine if respiratory rate is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2 on days 1, 2 and 15, followed by each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and 15 and on the end of treatment study visit.|Incidence of clinically significant changes in Blood Pressure, Blood pressure measured in Systolic and Diastolic mmHg. Each site will assess to determine if blood pressure is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2 on days 1, 2 and 15, followed by each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and 15 and on the end of treatment study visit.|Incidence of clinically significant changes in Oxygen Saturation, A pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation as a percentage. Determines the ratio of the current levels of oxygenated hemoglobin to deoxygenated hemoglobin. Each site will assess to determine if oxygen saturation is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., From baseline, pre-intervention, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and Cycle 2 on days 1, 2 and 15, followed by each subsequent treatment Cycle on Days 1 and 15 and on the end of treatment study visit.|Neurological assessment to grade Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), Using a 10-point immune effector cell encephalopathy \[ICE\] score for the grading of ICANS.
