A Study of Tiragolumab in Combination With Atezolizumab Compared With Placebo in Combination With Atezolizumab in Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic PD-L1-Selected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in participants with previously untreated locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic PD-L1-selected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tiragolumab plus atezolizumab or placebo plus atezolizumab.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Matching Placebo
Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Primary Analysis Set, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 59 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in the Primary Analysis Set, From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 59 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Up to approximately 59 months|Percentage of Participants With Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS), Up to approximately 59 months
Investigator-Assessed PFS in the Secondary Analysis Set, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 59 months)|OS in the Secondary Analysis Set, From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 59 months)|Investigator-Assessed Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), From randomization up to approximately 59 months|Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response (DOR), From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 59 months)|Investigator-Assessed PFS Rates at 6 Months and 12 Months, 6 months, 12 months|OS Rates at 12 Months and 24 Months, 12 months, 24 months|Time to Confirmed Deterioration (TTCD) Assessed Using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core (QLQ-C30) Score, TTCD using EORTC QLQ-C30 is an initial 10-point decrease in global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL) and functioning from baseline that must be held for at least two consecutive assessments or an initial clinically meaningful decrease above baseline followed by death. EORTC QLQ-C30: a self-reported measure, consisting of 30 questions that assess 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain), GHS and QoL, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Functioning items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all to 4=Very much, with higher score indicating worse outcome. Symptom items (GHS and QoL) are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor to 7=Excellent. Scores will be linearly transformed with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 100. Higher score indicates better outcome., From randomization until the first confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (up to approximately 59 months)
