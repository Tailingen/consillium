The AIM Study: Assessing the Impact of Margin Reduction
This study will observe patients who receive external beam radiation for prostate cancer. These patients will be localized and tracked (targeted) with the Calypso 4D Localization System. These patients will have a uniform treatment plan with reduced PTVs (prostate treatment volume) and will be assessed at multiple time points for quality of life and side effects related to radiation therapy.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Observation
Evaluate patient quality of life using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) for evaluation of the QOL, 2 year follow-up
Collection of patient tracking data from the Calypso 4D Localization System, 9 weeks|Record the number of interventions patients receive during radiation delivery to maintain the target within the treatment plan, 9 weeks|Evaluate the user satisfaction with the Calypso 4D Localization System, At time of use|Evaluate acute and chronic (up to 2 years) toxicities of external beam prostate radiation using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events for standardization of acute and chronic toxicities from the subject, 2 year follow-up
EPIC surveys and adverse events recorded and categorized using the CTCAE v3.0 will be collected and summary statistics performed. The patient's individual tracking graphs will be evaluated for motion type and frequency.
