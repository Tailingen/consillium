A Phase II Trial of Perioperative Chemotherapy With Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin(MODIFIED FOLFOX6) in Patients With Locally Advanced Operable Gastric Cancer
The role of perioperative chemotherapy in potentially operable advanced gastric cancer (AGC) with regional lymph node metastasis is still in the area of controversy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of folinic acid (FA), infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX6) in potentially resectable AGC with regional lymph node (LN) metastasis.
