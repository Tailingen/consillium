Uniportal Tubeless VATS for the Evaluation of Biopsy for Second-generation Sequencing in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
The study is a single-center, prospective, open-label randomized controlled study. This study evaluates the eligibility rate of different biopsy methods (tubeless tubeless VATS vs. CT guided fine needle aspiration) for the detection of molecular genetic characteristics of peripheral NSCLC next-generation sequencing, and its main purpose is to evaluate the use of tumor gene profiling (NGS) The best biopsy technique, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University is the research center. It is expected to be completed between 2021-3-1 and 2023-3-1.
