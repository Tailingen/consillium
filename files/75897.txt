PREvention of Atrial Fibrillation in patientS Undergoing thorAcic surGEry for Lung Cancer
The aim of this study is to assess whether prophylactic treatment with metoprolol or losartan is able to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery for lung cancer, showing elevated plasma levels in NT probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), measured in the perioperative period.
Lung Cancer|Atrial Fibrillation
DRUG: Metoprolol|DRUG: Losartan
Incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, up to 10 days
Evaluation of NT-proBNP in the days following the start of treatment and post surgery duration of hospital stay, up to 10 days
Postoperative atrial fibrillation is one of the most common complication after thoracic surgery for lung cancer, with an incidence ranging from 8 to 20% after lobectomy and up to 42% after pneumonectomy.

In a recent study we demonstrated that a high perioperative plasma levels of NT-proBNP is able to identify patients at risk for AF (incidence of 65%).

It has also been demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are able to prevent atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure, after myocardial infarction, in hypertensive patients and after electrical cardioversion.
