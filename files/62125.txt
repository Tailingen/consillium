Evaluation of the Use of Trental and Vitamin E For Prophylaxis of Radiation Necrosis
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of Trental and Vitamin E can help reduce the incidence of radiation necrosis (a lesion that usually occurs at the original tumor site) after radiosurgery. These two drugs are commonly used to treat radiation necrosis when it occurs but the hope is that these drugs can be used to prevent radiation necrosis from ever occurring.
