Photobiomodulation Home-use Device for Prevention or Treatment of Oral Mucositis in Patients With Head&Neck Malignancies
Patients with head and neck malignancy that are treated with Radiation Therapy \[RT\] are expected to develop Oral Mucositis (OM) in 60% of cases. Mucositis is a side effect of radiation and / or chemotherapy that causes severe pain and inability to eat and drink and a decrease in quality of life. In addition it may impair the treatment protocol and treatment outcomes.

Photobiomodulation is a non-ionizing optical radiation in the near or near-infrared range used for acceleration of wound healing and pain reduction. Photobiomodulation therapy for the reduction of mucositis is included in the International Guidelines of the MASCC / ISOO Association and the British NICE. To date the treatment has been performed by members of professional medical staff in hospitals or clinics.

The study device is home-used photobiomodulation device approved for indications of pain reduction and acceleration of wound healing. The device has shown efficacy in treating mucositis around dental implants in a clinical trial and after oncological treatments in a limited number of cases as reported in the scientific literature.

Proportion of patients performing at least 50% of expected daily treatments during radiotherapy period., The patients are expected to treat themselves 5 times a week during the 7 week period of radiotherapy, accumulating to a total of 35 treatments. The date of each treatment will be documented in a diary. The number of treatment actually done divided by the 35 expected treatments will be calculated. The outcome is the proportion of patients that will treat themselves at least 18 treatments out of the 35 expected (at least 50%)., 7 weeks
The proportion of the patients that will experience severe oral mucositis, The proportion of the patients that will experience severe oral mucositis defined as grade 3 or 4 of the World Health Organization (WHO) grading for oral mucositis, according to the following:

Grade 0=the patient has no signs and symptoms; Grade 1=painless ulcers, edema, or mild soreness; Grade 2=painful erythema, edema, or ulcers but able to eat; Grade 3=painful erythema, edema, or ulcers but unable eat; Grade 4=requires parenteral or enteral support, 7 weeks
