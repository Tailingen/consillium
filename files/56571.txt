Safety, Efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine in CLL
On behalf of the Israel CLL study group the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: COVID-19 serology
Change in the number of participants with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-related adverse events as assessed by a questionnaire relating to the development of patients' side effects to the vaccine, which was developed by study investigators., Answers to the questionnaire are reported and described in a scale of 0-5, where zero indicates the lack of any side effect. Each patient is asked to complete the questionnaire on the same clinic visit when blood is drawn for serologic tests., 2-6 weeks after second vaccination, 3 months after second vaccination, 6 months after second vaccination|Antibody Persistence after Third Dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination in Serongative Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, To study the efficacy of booster vaccine in patients with CLL who are seronegative after first 2 vaccines, 6 months
Change in the immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine assessed on the basis of anti covid-19 IgG levels., A centralized assessment of the serological response for 4 medical centers is performed on serum samples stored at -60 Â°C using Abbott-SARS-CoV-2 IgG quant (Positive value \> 151; range 0-40.000). The other 4 medical centers performed the test locally using DiaSorins-LAISISON SARS-CoV S1/S2 IgG test (positive value \>15 range 15-400). In the central virus laboratory at the Chaim Sheba Medical center the test was done by Elisa-RDB (positive value \>1.1; range 1.1-10)., 2-6 weeks after second vaccination, 3 months after second vaccination, 6 months after second vaccination
