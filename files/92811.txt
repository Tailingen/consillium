Random Evaluation of Patients Who Have Had Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the necessity of using hemostatic agents as a tool when performing robotic partial nephrectomy in the treatment of kidney cancer. This project asks whether patients who undergo robotic partial nephrectomy without the surgeon using hemostatic agents during the procedure will have the same, fewer, or more complications than when patients undergo this same surgery with the surgeon using hemostatic agents during the procedure.
Kidney Cancer
DEVICE: Hemostatic Agent|OTHER: No Hemostatic Agent
An absolute change in hemoglobin, The change in hemoglobin will be measured as the difference between the hemoglobin obtained postoperatively and the hemoglobin obtained preoperatively., up to 6 months
Total number of major bleeding complications, Major complications are blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, reoperation and endovascular ablation, up to 6 months|Safety monitoring parameters: Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Safety monitoring parameters including stroke, death, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction and urine leak, up to 6 months|Operating room parameters, Operating room parameters including number of sutures used during renorrhaphy and capsular closure, duration of renorrhaphy and patients in group 2 with no hemostatic agents who required HA at the surgeons discretion, up to 6 months|Patients with a hospital stay over 30 days, Total length of all inpatient hospital stay over 30 days measured in days, up to 6 months
