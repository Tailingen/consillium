A Bridging Study of a Recombinant Human Papillomavirus 16/18 Bivalent Vaccine in Preadolescent Girls
This is a bridging trial of the recombinant HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity (type specific IgG antibody) and safety of the tested vaccine administered in girls aged 9-17 years is non-inferior to young healthy adults of 18-26 years according to the standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months). Meanwhile, this study tries to compare the difference of safety and immunogenicity among different schedules (0-6m vs 0-1-6m).

PROCEDURE: 3 doses of HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine|PROCEDURE: 2 doses of HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroconversion rates and geometric mean concentrations at Months 7 (type specific IgG antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type specific IgG antibody level on day 0 (before the 1st dose) ,six month after the dose 1 (before the 3rd dose) and one month after dose 3, Month 7
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, All the adverse events in one month after each dose would be recorded in the diary card. All the Serious Adverse Events(SAE) occurred during clinical trial time frame would be recorded., Month 7
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 seroconversion rates and geometric mean concentrations at Months 7 (type specific neutralizing antibody), To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 type specific neutralizing antibody level on day 0 (before the 1st dose) ,six month after the dose 1 (before the 3rd dose) and one month after dose 3, Month 7
Totally 750 healthy girls of 9-17 years and 225 healthy young women of 18-26 years were enrolled. The subjects of 9-14 years will be stratified into 2 subset. Subjects in each subsets will be randomly assigned into the standard 0-1-6m schedule group or an alternative 0-6m group. All subjects of 15-26 years of age will receive the standard 0-1-6m schedule. Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for 1 month after each injection. Severe adverse events during the trial were followed up. Serum samples from all the subjects would be collected on day 0, 6m, 7m to evaluate the immunogenicity.
