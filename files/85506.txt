Strategic Intervention on Preserving Motor Function During Awake Craniotomy
This study aims to compare the motor functions after traditional or a new surgical plan during awake glioma resection surgery.
Glioma
PROCEDURE: Awake craniotomy
Motor function preserved better in new surgical plan group, Motor function of the participants in new surgical plan group is better preserved and recover faster than the participants in traditional surgical group.The difference between the motor functions of two groups are analyzed using t-test or chi-square test according to the type of data., through study completion, an average of 2 years
This study concentrates on patients with type III motor area glioma. In the awake surgery, The investigators compare the new surgical plan, which the investigators use a monopolar stimulator to determine and retain the tumor margin within 5mm from the posterior limb of the inner capsule. For the traditional surgical plan, the investigators use bipolar stimulator according to the current standard surgery plan. After the positive points are identified by stimulator, the positive points are retained in order to preserve the motor function while all the non-positive points of the tumor are resected. This study is designed to determine whether the new surgical plan is more suitable for type III motor area glioma patients.
