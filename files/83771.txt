Patient Preference for Pegfilgrastim (NeulastaÂ®) Application Forms
The study aims to compare two application forms (pre-filled syringe and On-body injector) of the same active drug (pegfilgrastim) in adult patients under chemotherapy regarding patient preference and health economics. Chemotherapy will be supported with pegfilgrastim for four subsequent chemotherapy cycles using alternating application forms.

Neutropenia is one of the most common side effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia and infectious complications are associated with chemotherapy dose delays and reductions and an increased risk of hospitalization. Prophylaxis with recombinant G-CSFs reduces the incidence, severity and duration of CIN and the risk of developing FN. Pegfilgrastim is available for over 10 years and is specified in the SmPC to be applied at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. For this application patients often have to return to their physician one day after chemotherapy treatment for the sole purpose of receiving pegfilgrastim subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. For different reasons, some of the patients requiring pegfilgrastim may not be able to return at this day and thus may not receive pegfilgrastim in accordance with the SmPC. The On-body injector for pegfilgrastim provides an option for patients not to return to the clinic/medical office the day after chemotherapy for their pegfilgrastim injection. The kit includes a single-use prefilled syringe co-packed with the On-body injector for pegfilgrastim. The On-body injector is applied to the patient's skin at the day of chemotherapy treatment and it automatically delivers pegfilgrastim approximately 27 h after the On-body injector was applied to the patient's skin.

Patient-reported outcomes on preference for either application form can help to guide physicians' treatment choice, particularly in terms of application of the same active substance, in this study pegfilgrastim.

This study aims to compare the two application forms of pegfilgrastim (pegfilgrastim pre-filled syringe vs. On-body injector for pegfilgrastim) with regard to patient preference and health economy. A trial design with randomization of patients to receive the two application forms of pegfilgrastim in an alternating sequence for 4 cycles starting with either On-body injector for pegfilgrastim (Arm A) or pegfilgrastim pre-filled syringe (Arm B) was chosen. In this way, all patients will receive both application forms in order to be able to decide for their individual preference. Four cycles (that means each patient will receive each application form of pegfilgrastim twice) should be a sufficient number for the patient to make a decision. This design with two treatment arms serves to exclude a systematic bias that might be generated when starting with the same application form for all patients.
