Investigation of MP Pollution in the Human Respiratory System and Its Relationship to Lung Cancer
This project will study and characterize Microplastic (MP) burden in the lungs of patients undergoing Bronchoalveolar Levage (BAL) in thoracic clinics at Moffitt.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) during Bronchoscopy
Characterization of Microplastic (MP) Burden in the Lungs, Microplastic (MP) Burden in the Lungs will be determined by the results of the Bronchoscopy/Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL).

MPs isolated from Bronchoalveolar Fluid (BALF) will be characterized using Raman spectroscopy (RS). RS is a vibrational spectroscopy technique based on the inelastic scattering of light that provides information on the molecular vibrations of a system in the form of a vibrational spectrum. The Raman spectrum is akin to a fingerprint of chemical structure allowing identification of the components present in the sample.

For each sample, data will be generated on the presence or absence of MPs, total number of MPs, and polymer subtype distribution of MPs identified in the samples., Up to 24 Months
Concentration of Microplastics (MPs) in Lung Cancer Patients, Concentration of Microplastics (MPs) will be determined by the number of MPs identified in 10-mLs of Bronchoalveolar Fluid (BALF)., Up to 24 Months|Concentration of Microplastics (MPs) in Non-Lung Cancer Patients, Concentration of Microplastics (MPs) will be determined by the number of MPs identified in 10-mLs of Bronchoalveolar Fluid (BALF)., Up to 24 Months
