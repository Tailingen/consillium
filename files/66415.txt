Nous-PEV: a Novel Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer and Melanoma
From Protocol v3.0 dated 16Jun2022. This is an international, multicenter, open-label, multiple cohort, First in Human, phase 1b clinical study, designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, and to detect any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of a personalized vaccine (PEV) based on GAd-PEV priming and MVA-PEV boosting, combined with SoC first-line immunotherapy using an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with unresectable stage III/IV cutaneous melanoma or with stage IV NSCLC (PDL1 ≥ 50%). The PEV vaccines will be prepared on an individual basis, following a tumor biopsy performed at the time of screening and subsequent NGS analysis, to identify patient-specific tumor mutations. Both neoantigen-encoding genetic vaccines are administered intramuscularly using 1 prime with GAd-PEV and 3 boosts with MVA-PEV in combination with the licensed programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody pembrolizumab in adult patients in patients with unresectable stage III/IV cutaneous melanoma (Cohort a) or with stage IV NSCLC (PDL1 ≥ 50%) (Cohort b).

Study IMPs:

Nous-PEV vaccine is composed of 2 sets of IMPs:

* GAd-PEV
* MVA-PEV

Treatment phases:

A) Induction phase with pembrolizumab (cycles 1, 2 and 3). B) Priming phase including 1 GAd-PEV administration with pembrolizumab (cycle 4).

C) Boosting phase including 3 boosting administrations of MVA-PEV with pembrolizumab (cycles 5, 6 and 7).
