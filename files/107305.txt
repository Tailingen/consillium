Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of CS231295 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is a single-arm, open-label, first-in-human study of CS231295, comprising two phases: dose escalation (including single-dose and multiple-dose) and cohort expansion. The Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) observation period includes 6 days for single-dose and the first cycle (28 days) for multiple-dose. The overall study consists of screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period.

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of CS231295 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of CS231295 in appropriate tumor(s).
