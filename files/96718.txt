Response Evaluation in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
Recently, a few small trials have shown promising results on value of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography imaging in response assessment in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma. These studies considered different parameters in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) analysis, mainly the standardized uptake value and volume-based parameters such as total glycolytic volume.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
To validate a semi-automated iterative threshold-based region growing algorithm in a previously published series of patients., 4 months
To extend the analysis to another series of consecutive patients with MALIGNANT PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA treated with first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, and to perform a combined analysis of the two groups., 4 months|To validate the new liver-based threshold semi-automated algorithm on the GE ADW4.6 workstation with the algorithm validated in step 1 in the same subset of patients., 4 months
This is a retrospective analysis of two consecutive and homogeneous series of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients treated with first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and evaluated by CT scan and FDG-PET.
