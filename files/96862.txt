Imaging and Biomarkers of Hypoxia in Solid Tumors
Hypoxia, meaning a lack of oxygen, has been associated strongly with a wide range of human cancers. Hypoxia occurs when tumor growth exceeds the ability of blood vessels to supply the tumor with oxygenated blood. It is currently understood that hypoxic tumors are more aggressive. Current methods for measuring hypoxia include invasive procedures such as tissue biopsy, or insertion of an electrode into the tumor. EF5-PET may be a non-invasive way to measure tumor hypoxia.
Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: PET Scan|DRUG: EF5|DRUG: Carbogen|DRUG: Dichloroacetate
18F-EF5 uptake (tumor: blood ratio) before and after carbogen breathing for a subset of subjects., 1-5 days|18F-EF5 uptake (tumor: blood ratio) before and after administration of DCA for a subset of subjects., 1-5 days
Levels of secreted hypoxia markers in plasma., 1-5 days|Hypoxia gene and protein expression scores in patients undergoing biopsy or surgical resection., 1-5 days
To establish PET imaging with the tracer EF5 as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor and to establish the measurement of secreted markers in blood as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor.
