Merkel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Protocol
A Phase II Study designed to evaluate the efficacy of Chemo-Radiotherapy in achieving loco-regional control in patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) of the skin. Patients will undergo PET scans to assist in staging and planning the patient's treatment as well as assessing response at the conclusion of treatment.
