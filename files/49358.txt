Study of Itacitinib for the Prophylaxis of Graft-Versus-Host Disease and Cytokine Release Syndrome After T-cell Replete Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
In this trial, the investigators will begin to explore the possibility that, as in mice, janus kinase inhibitor 1 (JAK1) inhibition with haploidentical-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may mitigate graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) while retaining Graft-versus-Leukemia (GVL) and improving engraftment. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety of itacitinib with haplo-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) measured by the effect on engraftment and grade III-IV GVHD.

PROCEDURE: Stem cell transplantation|DRUG: Itacitinib|OTHER: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT)|OTHER: Human Activity Profile
Number of Participants With Graft Failure (Pilot Study Only), Failure to engraft will be defined as failure to achieve absolute neutrophil count \>500 for 3 days by day 35., By day 35|Number of Participants With Grades III-IV Acute GVHD, -Incidence of acute grade III-IV GVHD will be assessed using Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) criteria. Attempts should be made to confirm the diagnosis pathologically by biopsy of target organ(s)., Through day 100
Number of Participants Who Experience Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), * The number of participants who experience CRS will be summarized by count of participants who experience Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, \& 5 CRS. The worst grade experienced by participant will be noted.
* Grade 1: symptoms not life threatening \& require symptomatic treatment alone, includes fever, nausea, fatigue, malaise
* Grade 2: symptoms require/respond to limited intervention - oxygen (O2) \<40%, \<=3 liters (L) nasal cannula or hypotension responsive to fluids or low dose of 1 vasopressor or grade 2 renal or hepatic toxicity
* Grade 3: symptoms require/respond to aggressive intervention - O2 \>=40%, \>3L nasal cannula or hypotension requiring high dose or multiple vasopressors or grade 3 renal toxicity or grade 4 transaminitis, new onset altered mental status, new cardiomyopathy without wall motion abnormality
* Grade 4: life-threatening symptoms - requirement for ventilator support or grade 4 rental toxicity (excluding transaminitis)
* Grade 5: death, Through day 28|Number of Participants With Treatment Related Mortality, -Death that results from a transplant procedure-related complication (e.g. infection, organ failure, hemorrhage, GVHD) rather than from relapse of the underlying disease or an unrelated cause, Day 180|Cumulative Incidence of Grades II-IV Acute GVHD (Expansion Phase), * Incidence of acute grade II-IV GVHD will be assessed using Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) criteria. Attempts should be made to confirm the diagnosis pathologically by biopsy of target organ(s).
* The cumulative incidence of aGVHD was estimated using Fine-Gray's sub-distribution methods to account for competing risk of death without aGVHD., Day 100
