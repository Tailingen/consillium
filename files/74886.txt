Open Label Clinical Trial of Intravenous Crotoxin Part 3
The primary objective of the study is to assess whether human subjects can be made tolerant to intravenously administered Crotoxin and achieve higher and more therapeutically effective doses levels without the previously reported adverse effects associated with bolus i.m. administration.
Cancer
DRUG: Crotoxin
Tolerability of intra-patient dose escalation, Assess the safety and tolerability of Crotoxin administered intravenously to Stage IV cancer patients using intra-patient dose escalation procedure., 28 days|Confirmation of the induction of drug tolerance, Confirm in a controlled phase I trial that human subjects can be made tolerant to intravenously administered Crotoxin thereby reducing the potential for adverse drug effects, 28 days
Assessment of drug efficacy, Document any objective anti-tumour responses that occur in patients treated on this protocol., 112 days
Crotoxin has been shown to induce neurotoxic tolerance in animals allowing them to receive high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side effects.

The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects to subjects.

The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost five times that of the previously reported MTD.

The revised protocol incorporates continuous infusion with a mobile pump and includes active suppression of the allergic reaction by pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.
