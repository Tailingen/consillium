Physical Activity in Cancer Patients in an Oncology Day Clinic - Implementing a Person-centered Program Led by Nurses
Background: Physical activity has demonstrated benefits in alleviating side effects and improving well-being in people with cancer. However, activity levels remain low during systemic treatment. Nurses are optimally positioned to lead interventions fostering an activity-friendly culture.

Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential effects of the nurse-led, interprofessionally developed physical activity concept OncoMoveNurse in an outpatient oncology setting.

Methods: Using a mixed-methods design over 15 months (10/2024-12/2025), the study includes implementation and evaluation phases. Quantitative data (n=50 patients, collected from 06/2025-09/2025) will assess primary (physical activity behavior) and secondary outcomes (self-efficacy, well-being, mood) via validated PROMs. Qualitative insights will be gathered through digital storytelling (n=2 patients, n=2 nurses) and one focus group (n=8 interprofessional team members). Inclusion criteria for patients include age ≥18, cancer diagnosis, at least three treatments in the day clinic, and sufficient German language skills.

Intervention: OncoMoveNurse comprises five adaptable components: modular activity structure, safety framework, communication strategy, a team approach, and person-centered orientation. Supporting materials (e.g., posters, videos, exercise tools) and tailored implementation strategies were co-developed in alignment with core values.

Analysis: Quantitative data will be analyzed using SPSS (paired t-tests, p\<.05); qualitative data via content analysis in MAXQDA. A mixed-methods synthesis will integrate findings.

Ethics \& Data Protection: Patient data collection will commence following ethics approval. All data are anonymized, stored securely, and handled in accordance with Swiss data protection laws.

Conclusion: This study will provide insights into the feasibility of nurse-led physical activity promotion in outpatient oncology and inform future outcome evaluations.

physical activity behaviour, Physical activity behavior will be assessed using the "Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Assessment Questionnaire" (BSA).

The BSA consists of 16 items that capture the duration of physical activity in minutes per day across different intensity levels (light, moderate, vigorous), as well as daily sedentary time. Responses are aggregated and converted into minutes per week. The questionnaire demonstrates good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.82 to 0.89, and test-retest reliability of r = 0.76. Construct validity has been confirmed through correlations with accelerometer data (r = 0.68), and discriminant validity has been demonstrated by significant differences between active and inactive groups., from enrollment to the end of treatment or three months after enrollment whichever timepoint comes first
Self-efficacy for physical activity, Self-efficacy for physical activity will be measured using the Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Scale (SSA). The SSA assesses an individual's subjective belief in their ability to maintain regular physical activity despite potential barriers. The questionnaire comprises 12 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale, anchored by the verbal descriptors: not at all confident, maybe, and completely confident. The scale score for each participant is calculated as the arithmetic mean of all 12 item scores. The internal consistency of the SSA is high, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 \[36\]., from enrollment to the end of treatment or three months after enrollment whichever timepoint comes first|health-related quality of life, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a standardized questionnaire used to assess health-related quality of life in individuals with cancer \[37, 38\].

It consists of 30 items organized into five functional scales (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and role functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), a global health status/quality of life scale, and several single-item symptom measures. Responses are given on a four-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much). Scale scores are standardized, with higher scores on the functional scales indicating better quality of life.

The internal consistency of the functional scales ranges from Cronbach's alpha = 0.70 to 0.90. The questionnaire demonstrates good test-retest reliability, as well as strong construct and criterion validity, and is widely used in oncological research., from enrollment to the end of treatment or three months after enrollment whichever timepoint comes first
Background and Rationale Staying physically active during cancer treatment can help alleviate distressing symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and dyspnoea, and can improve the quality of life of individuals with cancer. Nevertheless, physical activity often decreases during treatment due to various factors, including general physical decline, treatment-related side effects (e.g., nausea, dizziness, muscle weakness), and psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, lack of motivation, depressive symptoms). Other contributing factors may include breathlessness, oxygen deficiency, and reduced physical endurance.

To counteract this, individuals with cancer should be specifically encouraged to engage in physical activity during their outpatient visits-before, during, and after chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other treatments. The goal is to integrate more physical activity into everyday life.

For this purpose, a dedicated physical activity concept has been developed by a team of experienced professionals. This concept is built around five core components:

1. A modular exercise catalogue
2. A safety protocol
3. A communication strategy
4. Team orientation
5. Person-centeredness Further details are available at www.onkomovenurse.net.

   ________________________________________ Risk / Benefit Assessment

   Benefits:

   Participants will not experience direct benefits from the survey. However, their involvement contributes to the improvement of clinical practice and scientific knowledge.

   At the personal level:

   Participants may experience improved well-being and reduced symptom burden (e.g., fatigue, pain, dyspnea). They will also receive support from oncology nurses to expand their repertoire of safe, low-threshold physical activity options.

   At the organizational level:

   Development of a practice-oriented physical activity concept tailored to patients and professionals; promotion of interprofessional collaboration; strengthening of the nursing role; enhancement of person-centered care and institutional reputation.

   At the research level:

   Systematic evaluation of the physical activity concept to improve care for individuals with cancer; strengthening the role of nurses in health promotion in the outpatient setting.

   Vision:

   To serve as a national model for symptom management and physical activity interventions in oncology care across Switzerland.

   ________________________________________ Objective(s) The aim of the project is to implement the OnkoMoveNurse physical activity concept in an oncology outpatient setting under the leadership of oncology nurses and to assess its feasibility for individuals with cancer. Quantitative and qualitative surveys of patients and healthcare professionals will provide initial insights into the potential effects on physical activity behaviour.

   ________________________________________ Endpoint(s) Primary endpoint: Physical activity behaviour of participants Secondary endpoints: Self-efficacy regarding physical activity, well-being, and mood. Demographic and clinical data will be collected to describe the sample.
