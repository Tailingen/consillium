Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy +/- the PI3K Inhibitor Inavolisib in HER2+, HR+, PIK3CA Mutant Early Breast Cancer
Evaluation of the potential incremental efficacy and safety of inavolisib in the neoadjuvant endocrine treatment of early-stage HER2-positive, HR-positive, PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Inavolisib|DRUG: PHESGO|DRUG: Endocrine therapy
Pathologic complete response in the breast and axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0), Pathological complete response (ypT0/is ypN0) is defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast and axilla., 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)
Rates of ypT0 ypN0; ypT0 ypN0/+; ypT0/is ypN0/+; ypT(any) ypN0, ypT0 ypN0 is defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive or non-invasive viable tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast and axilla; ypT0 ypN0/+ is defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive or non-invasive viable tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast; ypT0/Tis ypN0/+ is defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive viable tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast, 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations, Pathological complete response (ypT0/is ypN0) is defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast and axilla., 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|Response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after study treatment in both arms, Clinical (c) and imaging (i) response will be assessed every 2nd cycle and before surgery by physical examination and imaging tests. Sonography is the preferred examination.

The response categories of the breast are:

* Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast
* Partial response (PR): reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of the primary tumor size by 50% or more
* Stable disease (NC): no significant change in tumor size during treatment which means an estimated reduction of the tumor area by less than 50%, or an estimated increase in the size of the tumor area lesions of less than 25%
* Progressive disease (PD): development of new, previously undetected lesions, or an estimated increase in the size of pre-existing lesions by 25% or more after at least two cycles of therapy, 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|Percentage of patients receiving additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy after residual disease was confirmed by core biopsy at the end of study treatment, In case of ycT0 and no tumor residuals in the biopsy, it is recommended to undergo surgery. Further neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy and HER2-therapy will be administered at the discretion of the investigator and according to standard of care., 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|Breast conservation rate after treatment, Breast conservation is defined as tumorectomy, segmentectomy or quadrantectomy as a most radical surgery., 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|Safety and tolerability profile (haematological and non-haematological adverse events) after the first 20 and the first 40 patients who started therapy and have completed two cycles of therapy, Tolerability and safety analyses include assessment of patients whose treatment had to be dose reduced, delayed or permanently stopped. The reason for treatment discontinuation includes aspects of efficacy (e.g. discontinuation due to tumor progression), safety (e.g. discontinuation due to haematological and non-haematological adverse events) and compliance (e.g. discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent). Safety by toxicity grades are defined by the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, 6 weeks|Overall safety and tolerability and treatment compliance in the two arms, Descriptive statistics for the 2 treatment arms will be given on the number of patients whose treatment had to be dose reduced, delayed or permanently stopped. Reasons for premature discontinuation will be categorized according to the main reason and will be presented in frequency tables. Safety by toxicity grades are defined by the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, laboratory parameters will be converted in CTC-grades and reported together with other adverse events., 21 weeks (time window + 3 weeks)|Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and overall survival (OS) in both arms and according to stratified subpopulations (data collected within a registry)., Survival endpoints are defined as the time period between randomization and first event and will be analyzed after the end of the study by referring to data from GBGÂ´s registries, up to 5 years
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase II study to evaluate the potential incremental efficacy and safety of inavolisib in the neoadjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive, HR-positive, PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.

170 patients with confirmed eligibility criteria and PIK3CA mutant breast cancer will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive: Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in combination with dual anti-HER2 blockade consisting of ready-to-use fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab as subcutaneous (PH-FDC SC) formulation q3w for 6 cycles (18 weeks) with (6cycles) or without inavolisib. Endocrine therapy consists of either tamoxifen 20mg or an aromatase inhibitor +/- GnRH analogue for premenopausal women and men.

In both study arms, treatment will be given until surgery/core-biopsy, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent of the patient.

All patients will undergo surgery or biopsy after completing study therapy to assess pCR rate.
