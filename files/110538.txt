Kinetics of Circulating Tumoral Cells in Bronchial Primitive Cancer
The pronostic value of Circulating Tumoral Cells(CTC) 's dosage by the method ISET速 (tumoral cell isolation by size) in patients with bronchial cancer was previously demonstrated.

However, no kinetic study was ever realized to study the value of the CTC as predictive indicator of answer to the therapy. This project plans to study patients in an early stage and patients at advance stage locally moved forward or metastatic of the disease by evaluation of the presence and the number of CTC before every cure. This collaborative and original study should allow to refine the diagnoses of answer and to plan the possible relapses what would allow a premature institution of the treatment.
