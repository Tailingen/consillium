Intratumoral Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy in Patients With Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase I dose escalation study of CAN-2409 plus prodrug in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary clinical objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of CAN-2409 plus prodrug when combined with standard surgery for NSCLC. The primary scientific objective is to determine the immunologic changes induced by CAN-2409 plus prodrug.

The purpose of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate the safety of CAN-2409 (aglatimagene besadenovec) plus prodrug prior to surgery in patients with NSCLC. CAN-2409 is a viral immunotherapy approach which utilizes intratumoral administration to selectively induce tumor cell death and elicit both an innate and an adaptive systemic anti-tumor immune response against the injected tumor and uninjected metastases. Local delivery enables these effects while aiming to minimize systemic toxicity. Standard of care surgical resection will be performed about 3 weeks after the CAN-2409 injection. Chemotherapy and/or radiation may begin 6-8 weeks after resection surgery. Choice of chemotherapy depends on the treating oncologist. CAN-2409 (aglatimagene besadenovec) was previously known as AdV-tk, and the combination of CAN-2409 plus prodrug was previously known as GMCI.
