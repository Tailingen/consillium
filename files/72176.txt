This is a Phase I/II, open-label multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cell product (OriCAR-017) in subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma". The study will consist of a Phase I dose escalation stage involving three doses as a single IV infusion) with up to 18 evaluable subjects and a dose expansion stage with 10-15 evaluable subjects, followed by a Phase II stage with up to 48 evaluable subjects.
