Dasatinib for Immune Modulation After Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Malignancies
This study uses a drug called dasatinib to produce an anti-cancer effect called large granular lymphocyte cellular expansion. Large granular lymphocytes are blood cells known as natural killer cells that remove cancer cells. Researchers think that dasatinib may cause large granular lymphocyte expansion to happen in patients who have received a blood stem cell transplant (SCT) between 3 to 15 months after the SCT. In this research study, researchers want to find how well dasatinib can be tolerated, the best dose to take of dasatinib and how to estimate how often large granular lymphocytic cellular expansion happens at the best dose of dasatinib.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Myeloid Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma|Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of dasatinib, 2 months
Estimate the non-DLTs associated with administration of dasatinib in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) recipients, Up to 6 months post treatment|Estimate the incidence of large granular lymphocytosis (LGL) and its clinical course in recipients of ASCT, Up to 6 months|Perform correlative in vitro studies to see if the large granular lymphocytes show enhanced cytotoxicity to leukemia/ lymphoma cell lines, Prior to day 1 administration of dasatinib and thereafter every 4 weeks
This is a phase I, dose-escalation study.
