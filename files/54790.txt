Bortezomib, Vorinostat and Dexamethasone for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
Both of bortezomib and vorinostat have identified Phase II doses for pediatric and adult patients of which no grade 4 dose limiting toxicities have been observed in prior studies. The pre-clinical synergy of these 2 agents when used in combination along with the lack of over-riding toxicities and different mechanisms of action provide strong rationale for a clinical trial investigating bortezomib and vorinostat in combination. This trial will use the identified Phase II dose which is at or below the maximum tolerated dose for both agents which have very acceptable toxicity profiles and such should prove feasible and tolerable in this relapsed/refractory ALL population.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Imatinib mesylate
Number of Subjects Who Achieved Complete Remission of Their Disease, Complete Remission (CR): A CR requires that the following be recorded concurrently: an absolute neutrophil count (segs and bands) \> 1000/μL, no circulating blasts, platelets \> 100,000/μL; adequate bone marrow cellularity with trilineage hematopoiesis, and \< 5% marrow leukemia blast cells. All previous extramedullary manifestations of disease must be absent. If patients continue on with treatment, there can be no evidence of recurrence of ALL for at least 4 weeks., Day 30
Number of Subjects Experiencing Drug Related Adverse Events, To characterize the toxicities of bortezomib, vorinostat and dexamethasone when used in combination. Toxicity will be graded using the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.0)., Day 1 of Treatment to 30 Days Post Treatment|Number of Subjects With Activated Caspases and Other Regulators of Apoptosis, Activation of caspases and other regulators of apoptosis in treated blast cells will be determined by Western analysis (correlative lab analysis)., From Day 1 to 30 Days After Last Dose
This is a phase II study of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m\^2 by intravenous pyelogram (IVP) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, vorinostat 180 mg/m\^2 by mouth (PO) per day (not to exceed 400 mg per day) days 1-14, and dexamethasone 6 mg/m\^2 PO days 4-15 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). No more than 3 treatment courses may be given.
