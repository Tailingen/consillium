SLN Detection With Tc-MSA-ICG in Lung Cancer Patients
It is necessary to develop a technique of sentinel lymph node detection using radioactive fluorescent dual contrast agent consisting targetable albumin for specific marker to accurately determine whether or not the sentinel lymph nodes have metastasized or non-metastasized. Therefore, investigators would like to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of radioactive fluorescent dual contrast agent to detect sentinel lymph nodes for patient-specific minimally invasive surgery.
