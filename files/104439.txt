Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Livmoniplimab (ABBV-151) as a Single Agent and in Combination With Budigalimab (ABBV-181) in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The study will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of livmoniplimab (ABBV-151) administered as monotherapy and in combination with budigalimab (ABBV-181) as well as to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of livmoniplimab alone and in combination with budigalimab. The study will consist of 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above., Up to approximately 9 months after the first dose date of last participant|Change in Vital Signs, Number of participants with clinically significant change from baseline in vital signs like systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be reported., Up to approximately 6 months after the first dose date of last participant|Change in Laboratory Parameters, Number of participants with clinically significant change from baseline in clinical laboratory test results like hematology will be reported., Up to approximately 6 months after the first dose date of last participant|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG), 12-lead resting ECGs will be recorded. Parameters include RR interval, PR interval, QT interval, and QRS duration., Up to approximately 6 months after the first dose date of last participant|Incidence of Anti-drug Antibody (ADA), The number of participants with anti-drug antibodies., Up to approximately 6 months after the first dose date of last participant|Dose Expansion Cohorts 10 to 12: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first study treatment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 6 months after the first dose date of last participant in Cohorts 10 to 12
