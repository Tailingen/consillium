Trajectory of Body Composition Identifies LAGC with Cachexia Following NACT
This longitudinal, multicentre cohort study included LAGC patients treated with NACT between 01/2010-12/2021. BC measurements including skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and total adipose tissue area (TATA) were evaluated by computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra at baseline and follow-up imaging. Unsupervised latent class growth mixed models were applied to distinguish potential longitudinal SMM and TATA trajectories for identifying cachexia. The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS), with secondary endpoints including Recurrence-free survival (RFS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Multiple Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for survival.
