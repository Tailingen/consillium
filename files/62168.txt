TACE With Thermosensitive Nanogel Versus Embosphere for HCC
To verify the safety and efficacy of TACE withThermosensitive Nanogel Embolic Agent for HCC.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Thermosensitive Nanogel Embolic Agent
Disease control rate (DCR), Probability of target lesion control, evaluated by the investigator and independent image review committee respectively (mRECIST)., One month after the last TACE
Success rate of target lesion embolization, Success rate of target lesion embolization, evaluated by the investigator and independent image review committee respectively., One month after the last TACE|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate of target lesions, evaluated by the investigator and independent image review committee respectively (mRECIST)., One month after the last TACE treatment|Disease control rate (DCR), Probability of target lesion control, evaluated by the investigator and independent image review committee respectively (mRECIST)., Three and six months after the first TACE|Equipment performance evaluation, (Intraoperative imaging ability, microcatheter delivery capacity) evaluated by the investigator., One month after the first TACE|Adverse events, Rate of adverse events, evaluated by the investigator (CTACE 5.0), Up to 24 months
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, non-inferiority design trial. Participants who meet the criteria will be randomly assigned into the experimental group or the control groupï¼Œwith a ratio of 1:1. In the experimental group the Thermosensitive Nanogel Embolic Agent will be used in the TACE procedure, while in the control group the Embosphere microspheres will be used. The primary endpoint is disease control rate of the target lesions at 1 month after the last TACE treatment.
