Phase I Trial of 5-Azacitidine Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of azacitidine and gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Also to determine the effect of azacitidine therapy on DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells.

Determine maximum tolerated dose, There will be 5 planned cohorts that will receive the escalating doses of azicitidine and gemcitabine. There will be at least 3 patients in each cohort, 28 days|Toxicity, To describe the toxicity associated with the use of this combination regimen, 28 days
Determine the effect of azacitidine therapy on DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells, Perform multivariable regression models to explore and assess associations among changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells, chemo effect on tumor (stable disease or shrinkage based on scans) and changes in tumor markers.
This is a Phase I single arm study designed for subjects with newly diagnosed, unresectable pancreatic cancer who have received no prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery with curative intent for pancreatic cancer.
