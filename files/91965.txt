Clinical Trial on the Efficacy and Safety of Chining Decoction in the Treatment of Radiation Stomatitis
This study evaluates the efficiency and safety of ChiNing decoction to head and neck cancer patients with radioactive stomatitis. Half of participants will receive ChiNing decoction, while others will receive recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) spray.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: ChiNing decoction
Grading standard of RTOG in acute radiation injury of oral mucosal, Score before the radiotherapy and every 1 week after the begining of the radiotherapy and after the end of radiotherapy, 8 days
The visual analogue scale of oral pain, Score before the radiotherapy and every 1 week after the begining of the radiotherapy and after the end of radiotherapy, 8 days|EORTCQLQ-H&N35, Score before the radiotherapy and every 1 week after the begining of the radiotherapy and after the end of radiotherapy, 8 days|patient body weight changes, Score before the radiotherapy and every 1 week after the begining of the radiotherapy and after the end of radiotherapy, 8 days|Safety index, Chech the blood routine, urine routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram before and after the radiotherapy, 2 days
IL-6 and TNF- alpha content, With distilled water repeatedly rinse of 1 min, 10 min after discarding the first mouthful of saliva, sit down, spit saliva to the sterile tube in 4 Centigrade， before and after the radiotherapy, 2 days|takes cast-off cells of oral mucosal, rinse the mouth with the physiological salt water , scrap sides of buccal oral mucosa 2 times appropriate efforts with appropriate effort, painted on a slide，before and after the radiotherapy, 2 days
This study uses randomized, controlled clinical research methods, through the observation of the treatment group (ChiNing decoction orally) and control group (recombinant human epidermal growth factor rhEGF spray on oral mucosal surface ) at different time points before and after radiotherapy, to evaluate the radiotherapy of acute radiation oral mucosa reaction (RTOG grade), quality of life score (EORTCQLQ-H\&N35 scale), oral pain (VAS score) and patient body weight changes of the two groups. At the same time，this study takes cast-off cells of oral mucosal to observe the microscopic characteristics of oral mucosa, and uses the ELISA method to detect IL-6 and TNF- alpha content in the saliva before and after radiotherapy.
