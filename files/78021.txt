Hyperlactatemia During and After Tumorcraniotomy
This study aims to investigate the association between hyperlactatemia and neurological disability, length-of-stay and mortality in patients who undergo tumorcraniotomy. The risk factors that induce lactat accumulation will also be explored.
Hyperlactatemia|Brain Tumor|Surgery|Anesthesia
OTHER: Serum-lactate < 2,2 mmol/L|OTHER: Serum-lactate >/= 2,2 mmol/L
Neurological disability, Modified Rankin Scale (Scoring 0-6, high scores meaning worse outcome), Change from baseline mRS at 30 days after surgery
Length of hospital stay, In days from admission to discharge., 1 year|Mortality, After 30 days, 6 months and 5 years
Hyperlactatemia is a frequent occurrence in brain tumor surgery. The existing studies, however, are all retrospective, reporting varying effects on clinical outcome. One study reported new neurological deficitis, some found an association with extended hospital stay, while others found no association with outcome. It is therefore important to conduct a prospective study of hyperlactatemia in this patientgroup.

Participants in this study will follow the standard treatment protocol for tumorcraniotomy, aside from 2-3 additional, perioperative blodgas analyses and 2 standardized measurements of neurological disability.
