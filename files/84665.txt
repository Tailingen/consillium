Neoadjuvant Dose-Dense For Early Her2Neu Positive Breast Cancer
Primary Objective:

• Determination of pathologic complete response (pCR) rates

Secondary Objective:

* Determination of cardiac toxicity as measured by: composite of LVEF, longitudinal strain and troponin.
* Breast conservation rates
* Overall survival

Study Design

* Approximately 34-74 patients with Her2 positive, Stage II-regional IV breast cancer will be enrolled.
* Patients will be stratified by ER/PR status.
* They will be randomized to ddACTHP vs TCHP.

  * Initially, 17 patients will be randomly assigned to each treatment arm.
  * If 3 or fewer patients have a pCR, then that arm will be terminated and no further patients will be entered on that treatment arm.
  * If 4 or more patients obtain a pCR, 20 additional patients (total of 37 patients) will be randomized to that treatment arm.
  * If 11 or more patients out of 37 have a pCR, the treatment will be of interest for further study.

Number of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), Pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy., 2 years
Number of Cardiac Toxicity Events, Determination of cardiac toxicity as measured by LVEF, longitudinal strain and troponin.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement of amount of blood being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart with each contraction.

Peak systolic longitudinal strain is calculated by averaging the values of peak systolic strain in the basal, mid and apical segments of the LV in 4-, 3- and 2-chamber views on echocardiograms. A value of \<-18% or a \>15% decline in strain from patient's baseline value will be used as a cut-off value.

A value of troponin I \> 0.08 ng/ml will be considered elevated., 2 years|Number of Non-cardiac Toxicities, The frequency of adverse events categorized using CTCAE v4.03, 2 years|Number of Participants With Breast Conservation, Number of participants with breast-conserving surgery for patients for whom mastectomy was planned before treatment. It would be based on surgical opinion at time of surgery if the tumor was appropriately "downstaged" to perform breast conserving surgery on patients previously recommended to have a mastectomy., 2 years|Number of Participants Alive at the End of the Study, Overall Survival - Number of participants alive at the end of the study., 2 years
