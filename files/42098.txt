Phase Ib/II Trial of Envafolimab Plus Lenvatinib for Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multi-center study of Phase Ib/II study to assess the efficacy and safety of Envafolimab combinded with Lenvatinib in the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors. The primary hypothesis of this study is that subjects will have a better objective response rate (ORR) when treated with Envafolimab plus Lenvatinib than SOC.
