Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Treatment With NLM-001 and Standard Chemotherapy Plus Zalifrelimab in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
In order to improve the survival rates and decrease progression of pancreatic advanced cancer, this study aims to evaluate the first line treatment approved for this disease (gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel) in combination with two experimental drugs, an inhibitor of the signaling pathway of Hedgehog and an immunotherapy drug able of blocking the CTLA-4 receptor.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading neoplasms in the world in terms of mortality, with very low survival rates mainly due to its rapid progression and diagnosis in advanced stages, which makes its treatment extremely difficult.

Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is currently considered the first-line standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer due to this superiority against other treatments.

In order to find an alternative to improve survival of advanced pancreatic cancer, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy with first-line treatment in combination of two experimental drugs, a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (NLM-001) and a CTLA-4 blocker (zalifrelimab) in previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
