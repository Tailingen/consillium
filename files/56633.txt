A Phase I/II Study of PDC-1421 for Treating Depression in Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the effective doses of PDC-1421 in cancer patients with depression.
Major Depressive Disorder
DRUG: PDC-1421 Capsule
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in patients taking 1 or 2 PDC-1421 capsules. The MADRS is a 10-item checklist including 1) depression \[apparent\]; 2) depression \[reported\]; 3) loss of interest; 4) suicidal ideation; 5) tension; 6) reduced appetite; 7) insomnia; 8) difficulty in activities; 9) concentration; and 10) pessimism. The MADRS is administered by a trained interviewer. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6, with anchors at 2-point intervals; higher scores indicating more severity (i.e., ranging from 0 \[no sadness\] to 6 \[extremely despondent\]). The total score is used to define treatment response (≥50% reduction from baseline) and partial response (20-49% reduction from baseline). Remission is defined as a score of \< 10. The following are used as an interpretation of scores:

0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression \>34 - severe depression, 5 weeks
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the effective doses of PDC-1421 in cancer patients with depression.
