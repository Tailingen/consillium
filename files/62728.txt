A Pilot Study of Ipilumimab and Radiation in Poor Prognosis Melanoma
This is a pilot study assessing the safety of the combination of ipilimumab administered concurrently with radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced or unresectable melanoma and patients at high risk for recurrence after resection.
