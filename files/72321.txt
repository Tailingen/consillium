STI571 in Treating Patients With Recurrent Leukemia
RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of cancer cells and may be an effective treatment for leukemia.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have recurrent leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: imatinib mesylate
Survival, To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI571 administered orally once daily without interruption to children with recurrent Ph+ leukemia., Length of study
Dose-limiting toxicities, To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of STI571 given on this schedule., Length of study|Characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior, To characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of STI571 in children with recurrent Ph+ leukemia., Length of study|Define the anti-leukemic activity of STI571, To preliminarily define the anti-leukemic activity of STI571 within the confines of a Phase I study., Length of study
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.
* Characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in this patient population.
* Determine preliminarily the antileukemic activity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (STI571) once daily for 28 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
