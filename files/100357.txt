Erlotinib + Bevacizumab for PS 2 Chemotherapy NaÃ¯ve Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The strategy for combining therapeutic agents in cancer treatments has been successful in multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. Erlotinib and bevacizumab target different pathways involved in tumor growth. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib results in greater efficacy than either agent alone. Furthermore, because there is little to no overlap in toxicity profile between the two agents, the combination is expected to be well tolerated and may provide even greater benefit for patients who are unable to receive cytotoxic therapy.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Bevacizumab
To Establish Rate of Non-progressive Disease at 4 Months in Patients With Advanced NSCLC Who Have Been Designated PS2 by Their Treating Physician, 4 months
Time to Progression, 12 months|Overall Survival, 12 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

* Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on day 1
* Erlotinib 150 mg po qd days 1-21
* Disease Assessment during even numbered cycles

If no progressive disease observed, continue (combination or single agent- see below) until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.

If progressive disease observed, treatment will be discontinued.

* Cycles will be repeated every 21 days up to a total of 6 cycles.
* Patients with non-progression after 6 cycles may stay on therapy (single agent erlotinib or the combination) until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity (at the physician discretion).
* Patients who require discontinuation of bevacizumab may receive at investigator's discretion erlotinib alone on study until progression.
* Patients who require discontinuation of erlotinib may receive at investigator's discretion bevacizumab alone until progression.
