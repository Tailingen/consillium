LEU01101: Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of LEU011 in Solid Tumours.
This is a dose-escalation open-label Phase 1/2a study. The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety and tolerability of LEU011 (autologous CAR T cells targeting NKG2D ligands) in patients with solid tumours.
Tumor, Solid
BIOLOGICAL: LEU011
To evaluate the dose limiting toxicity, safety and tolerability of a single dose of LEU011 in subjects with NKG2DL expressing relapsed/refractory solid tumours, Incidence and nature of dose limiting toxicities will be graded by American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus criteria., 28 days post administration of LEU011 immunotherapy|To identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LEU011, RP2D will be the MTD., 28 days post administration of LEU011 immunotherapy
This is a dose-finding study of the investigational immunotherapy LEU011 in patients with NKG2DL-expressing solid tumours. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of LEU011 and is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LEU011.

Enrolled patients will undergo a whole blood procurement in order to manufacture LEU011. Subjects will receive LEU011 as a single IV dose following pre-conditioning chemotherapy and will be followed up for up to two years on this trial.
