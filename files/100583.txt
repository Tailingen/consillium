Bevacizumab Combined With Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Chemotherapy to Treat Metastatic Mucosal Melanoma
Mucosal melanoma is rare and associated with extremely poor prognosis.No effective treatment for advanced mucosal melanoma patients.Investigators conducted a randomized phase II study in patients with previously untreated metastatic mucosal melanoma to characterize the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with carboplatin plus paclitaxel.

progress-free survival(PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause., From randomization up to 144 weeks
adverse event(AE), Any events,no matter related to interventions,occur during the period from the enrollment to death or 30 days after withdrawal from the trial, From randomization up to144 weeks|Overall Survival(OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 144 weeks
Mucosal melanoma is rare and associated with extremely poor prognosis.It is the second most common subtype in Asians.No effective treatment for advanced mucosal melanoma patients.Malignant melanoma is a highly vascular tumor in which vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) is strongly expressed and seems to play an important role in disease progression.A randomized phase II study evaluated the activity of Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel(CPB arm) in patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma.Overall response rates was 25.5%,median overall survival time(OS) was 12.3 months in the CPB arm. Investigators conducted a randomized phase II study in patients with previously untreated metastatic mucosal melanoma to characterize the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
