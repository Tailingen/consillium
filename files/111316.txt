* There is preclinical and clinical data on synergistic activity of angiogenesis inhibitors and anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) targeted therapy. Targeting VEGFR decreased T-regulatory cells and Myeloid-derived suppressor Cells. In addition, VEGF-A produced in the tumor microenvironment enhanced expression of PD-1 involved in CD8 T cell exhaustion8. The combination of targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), either in a parallel or sequential manner, could theoretically lead to enhanced anti-tumor responses, reflected in durable responses and prolonged survival. However, there have been lack of clinical data of targeted agents who developed progressive disease with ICIs.
* In previous phase I study, pharmacodynamics indicated a sustained occupancy of \> 70% of PD-1 molecules on circulating T-cells â‰¥ 2 months following infusion. Based on these findings, ICI use may retain the prolonged effect even after discontinuation. There was a case report of a sorafenib-refractory patient experiencing progressive disease during ICI combination treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody and the anti-GITR antibody within phase I trial followed by a prolonged tumor response during third-line regorafenib monotherapy.
* In patients with advanced HCC, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies, multi-kinase inhibitor (sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and lenvatinib) and ICIs are available treatment options, however, treatment sequencing and combination strategy are challenging.
* Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab demonstrated survival benefit and established as a new first-line therapy, hence it is clinically important to study the efficacy and toxicity of regorafenib after treatment with ICIs or ICI combination.
