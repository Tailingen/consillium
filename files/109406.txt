A Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With First- or Second-Line Therapy in Subjects With Treated Brain Metastases Due to Non-Squamous NSCLC (PASSPORT)
This was an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, Phase II trial of bevacizumab combined with first- or second-line therapy in patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. A total of 115 patients enrolled in the study.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Brain Neoplasms
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: First-Line Chemotherapy Agents|DRUG: Second-Line Chemotherapy Agents
Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (NCI CTCAE) Grade ≥2 Central Nervous System (CNS) Hemorrhage, The percentage of participants with symptomatic NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage, defined as the presence of clinical symptoms determined by the investigator to be directly referable to a Grade ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage.

Grade 1: Asymptomatic, radiographic findings only Grade 2: Medical intervention indicated Grade 3: Ventriculostomy, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, intraventricular thrombolysis, or operative intervention indicated Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; neurologic deficit or disability Grade 5: Death, From the first administration of bevacizumab until 60 days after discontinuation of bevacizumab treatment was reported (up to 2 years)
Overall Survival (OS) in First-line Setting, To assess overall survival in the subset of subjects treated in the first-line setting with bevacizumab plus either chemotherapy or erlotinib for non-squamous NSCLC with previously treated brain metastases., Time from enrollment to death from any cause (up to 2 years)|Number of Participants With Overall Survival (OS) in First-line Setting [1-Year or More Survival], Number of Participants with overall survival in the subset of subjects treated in the first-line setting with bevacizumab plus either chemotherapy or erlotinib for non-squamous NSCLC with previously treated brain metastases., Time from enrollment to death from any cause (up to 2 years)|OS in First-line and Second-line Settings, To assess overall survival in the subset of subjects treated in the first-line setting with bevacizumab plus either chemotherapy or erlotinib for non-squamous NSCLC with previously treated brain metastases., Time from enrollment to death from any cause (up to 2 years)|Number of Participants With OS in First-line and Second-line Settings [1-Year or More Survival], To assess the number of participants with overall survival in the subset of subjects treated in the first-line setting with bevacizumab plus either chemotherapy or erlotinib for non-squamous NSCLC with previously treated brain metastases., Time from enrollment to death from any cause (up to 2 years)|Number of Participants With Selected Adverse Events, Number of participants with selected adverse events (all grades based on NCI CTCAE) included any grade CNS hemorrhage, any grade pulmonary hemorrhage, any grade gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, Grade ≥ 2 arterial thromboembolic event, Grade ≥ 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction, Grade ≥ 3 non-CNS non-pulmonary hemorrhage, Grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, Grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, any serious adverse event\*, and any adverse event leading to study treatment discontinuation.

\*For serious adverse events, please see Adverse Event Reporting Section., From start of bevacizumab treatment to 60 days following discontinuation of bevacizumab (up to 2 years)
