Pregnancy-related Changes in Melanocytic Nevi
This study is

* to analyze whether more changes in melanocytic nevi (MN) occur in women during and after pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women of the same age
* and to analyze psychological effects of total body mapping and dermoscopic examination assisted by artificial intelligence during pregnancy.
Melanocytic Nevi (MN)
OTHER: standard-of-care clinical skin examination|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: skin assessment with the 2D FotoFinder ATBM master system|OTHER: data collection by participant questionnaire
Change in macroscopic aspect of melanocytic nevi, Change in macroscopic aspect of melanocytic nevi, for pregnant women: Visit 1 (between the 12th and 16th week of pregnancy), Visit 2 (between the 29th and 33rd week of pregnancy), Visit 3 (between 8 to 12 weeks after delivery). Non- pregnant women: Visit 1, Visit 2 (17 to 21 weeks after Visit 1)|Change in mole analyzer score with the 2D FotoFinder ATBM master system, mole analyzer score (0.0-1.0; 0 indicating no suspicion for melanoma, 1 indicating a high suspicion for melanoma), for pregnant women: Visit 1 (between the 12th and 16th week of pregnancy), Visit 2 (between the 29th and 33rd week of pregnancy), Visit 3 (between 8 to 12 weeks after delivery). Non- pregnant women: Visit 1, Visit 2 (17 to 21 weeks after Visit 1)
Change in number of new malignant melanoma, Change in number of new malignant melanoma, for pregnant women: Visit 1 (between the 12th and 16th week of pregnancy), Visit 2 (between the 29th and 33rd week of pregnancy), Visit 3 (between 8 to 12 weeks after delivery). Non- pregnant women: Visit 1, Visit 2 (17 to 21 weeks after Visit 1)|Change in psychological impact of skin cancer screening by descriptive analyzes of participants questionnaire, Change in psychological impact of skin cancer screening by descriptive analyzes of participants questionnaire (investigating the subjective examination experience, the impact on skin cancer worries and the participants' sun protection and self-inspection behaviour)., for pregnant women: Visit 1 (between the 12th and 16th week of pregnancy), Visit 2 (between the 29th and 33rd week of pregnancy), Visit 3 (between 8 to 12 weeks after delivery). Non- pregnant women: Visit 1, Visit 2 (17 to 21 weeks after Visit 1)
Melanocytic nevi (MN) are believed to undergo macroscopic and dermoscopic alterations during pregnancy. Possible changing features previously observed include color, pigment network, size, vascularization and the emerging of dots and globules. Recent studies have reported of melanoma being associated with increased mortality in pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant women. The new FotoFinderÂ® ATBM master device provides the combination of total body mapping with deep learning-driven body scan algorithm which identifies all pigmented skin lesions of the body surface by pattern recognition software and supplies a risk assessment score (0.0-1.0; 0 indicating no suspicion for melanoma, 1 indicating a high suspicion for melanoma).

This study is

* to analyze whether more changes in melanocytic nevi (MN) occur in women during and after pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women of the same age
* and to analyze psychological effects of total body mapping and dermoscopic examination assisted by artificial intelligence during pregnancy.
