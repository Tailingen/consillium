Immunosuppression's Long Term Impact on Anti-tumoral Oversight in Kidney Transplantation
Cancer is a well known complication about long term transplantation. Cancer outcomes are due to the immunosuppressive treatment that prevents transplanted people from rejection. By lowering the effectiveness of the immune system, immune cells are no longer able to seek and destroy cancer cells.

The goal here is to study immunes cells population of people that were transplanted 10 years ago and are now treated either by a corticosteroid - azathioprine association, or only by cyclosporine A.
Kidney Transplant; Complications
BIOLOGICAL: Immune cells population assesment
Immune cells study, Study 2 types of T lymphocytes (by flow cytometry) that are suspected to be responsible of the graft non rejection and the cancer outcome, treated by corticosteroid - azathioprine association or cyclosporine A, 12 months
bacteria study, Study the modification of the intestinal bacteria population that might led to an "operational tolerance", depending on the immunosuppressive treatment : the DNA will be extracted from the faeces and a typing will be carried out by Polymerase Chain Reaction, 12 months|cancer incidence, Assess cancer incidence, on a population of people with kidney transplantation (since 10 years) : observation of adverse events during visits, 12 months
