Oxycodone and Pregabalin for the Treatment of Oncological Neuropathic Pain
The aim of the study is to assess tolerability and activity of oxycodone and pregabalin in combination for the treatment of oncological neuropathic pain with two different strategies.
Cancer|Pain
DRUG: oxycodone|DRUG: pregabalin
Achievement of analgesia (decrease of at least 1/3 of pain intensity) assessed by NRS scale, within 15 days
Pain control rate, within 15 days|Reduction of Break Through Pain number, within 15 days|Record of adverse events, within 15 days|Reduction of allodynia in patients presenting it at T0, within 15 days|Patient satisfaction, within 15 days|Assessing whether COMT and mu blood polymorphisms are associated to response, within 15 days
Neuropathic pain is frequently diagnosed as a complication of cancer pain. While opioids are the mainstay of cancer pain management,their efficacy in neuropathic pain seems to be less then optimal,and adjuvant drugs, mainly anticonvulsants and antidepressants,are often combined with opioids in the analgesic regimen of patients with neuropathic cancer pain. This approach is suggested by well-established guidelines, but the analgesic benefit and the safety of pregabalin and oxycodone in combination is not yet documented.

The aim of this study is to assess the activity and tolerability of the addition of pregabalin to oxycodone in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain due to neoplasm.
