Studies on the H Pipelle, a New Device for Endometrial Sampling at Hysteroscopy
The investigators have developed a novel instrument for taking endometrial biopsies at no touch (vaginoscopic) hysterectomy which avoids the need to instrument the vagina with speculums and tenaculums, and also avoids the possible need for cervical dilatation. The investigators wish to study the ease of use and efficacy of the new device compared with traditional techniques of endometrial sampling at hysteroscopy.

We have developed a novel instrument for taking endometrial biopsies at no touch (vaginoscopic) hysterectomy which avoids the need to instrument the vagina with speculums and tenaculums, and also avoids the possible need for cervical dilatation. We wish to study the ease of use and efficacy of the new device compared with traditional techniques of endometrial sampling at hysteroscopy in terms of biopsy adequacy, the time taken to obtain a biopsy and patient experience.
