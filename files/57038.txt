Fruquintinib-based Treatment for Refractory Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcomas After Several Lines of TKIs' Resistance
This multicenter retrospective study assessed the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib-based treatment in patients with refractory bone and soft tissue sarcomas after several lines of TKIs' resistance.
Bone Sarcoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Refractory Tumor
DRUG: Fruquintinib
PFS, The time from the first administration of fruquintinib to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., 4months
OS, OS was calculated from the use of fruquintinib until death from any cause, 1year|ORR, ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response of complete or partial response(CR+PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors(RECIST) version 1.1., 1year|DCR, DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response of complete or partial response or stable disease(CR+PR+SD) according to RECIST 1.1., 1year|AEs, AEs were graded and recorded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE ) version 5.0., 1year
The short-lived duration of disease control and secondary drug resistance have posed a threat to the effect of TKIs. Fruquintinib is a novel TKI with a high selectivity of VEGFR-1,2,3 without metabolism by liver enzymes and was approved for application in mCRC. Serious drug resistance and the unique characteristics of fruquintinib have prompted us to verify whether this drug can reverse TKIs' resistance at a higher dose.
