A Trial of 2 Schedules of Ixabepilone Plus Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel Plus Bevacizumab for Breast Cancer
The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if ixabepilone plus bevacizumab is effective in shrinking or stopping the growth of cancer when given as first-line chemotherapy in participants with metastatic breast cancer. The study will also assess the safety of this combination treatment.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ixabepilone, 16 mg/m^2 + Bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg|DRUG: Ixabepilone, 40 mg/m^2 + Bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg|DRUG: Paclitaxel, 90 mg/m^2 + Bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg
Percentage of Participants With Best Tumor Response of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) While On-study, CR=Disappearance of all clinical and radiologic evidence of target lesions; PR=At least 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions., Baseline visit and then every 8 weeks to 12 months, then every 3 months until disease progression|Number of Participants With Best Response As Assessed With Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Best tumor response was assessed with RECIST. Complete response (CR)=Disappearance of all evidence of target lesions; Partial response (PR)=At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions; Progressive disease (PD)=At least a 20% increase from baseline in the sum of LD of target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. A response was confirmed if noted on 2 examinations at least 4 weeks apart., Baseline visit and then every 8 weeks to 12 months, then every 3 months until disease progression
Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival at Week 24, Week 24 Progression-free Survival was defined as the number of participants who neither progressed nor died before Week 24. Computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, only at the time of Interim Analysis, when all participants had been followed for 6 months., Date of randomization to Week 24|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progression or to death from any cause without prior documentation of progression. Participants who did not progress or die were to be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment., Date of randomization to date of progression, death, or last tumor assessment (maximum participant PFS of 29 months)|Median Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the time from the first dose of study therapy until measurement criteria were first met for a PR or CR, whichever was recorded first. Time to response was computed only for participants whose best response was PR or CR., Date of first PR or CR assessment to date of progression, death, or last tumor assessment (maximum participant time to response of 67 weeks)|Median Duration of Response, Duration of response was computed for participants whose best response was either PR or CR. Duration of overall response was defined as the period from the time that measurement criteria were first met for PR or CR, whichever was recorded first, until the first date of documented PD or death. Participants who neither relapsed nor died were to be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment., Date of first PR or CR assessment to date of progression, death, or last tumor assessment (maximum participant duration of response of 25 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Surviving at 1 Year, One year survival rates were computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Date first participant enrolled to 1 year|Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Treatment-related SAEs, Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, AEs Leading to Discontinuation, Treatment-related AEs, An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, drug dependency or abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, a congenital anomaly/birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization; or prolongs existing hospitalization. Treatment related=possibly, probably, or certainly related to and of unknown relationship to study treatment., At initiation of treatment throughout study, to a minimum of 30 days after last dose of study drug|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Hematology Laboratory Results by Worst Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade, CTC, Version 3 used to assess parameters.
