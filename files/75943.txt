Ningetinib (CT053PTSA) Plus Gefitinib in Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC Patients With EGFR Mutation and T790M Negative
This is a phase Ib, multi-center, open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative NSCLC who have progressed after EGFR TKI treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: CT053PTSA|DRUG: Gefitinib
Part 1（dose-escalation part）: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the CT053PTSA and gefitinib combination will be determined according to incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.03, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28|Part 2（expansion part）: Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR), defined as a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) occurring at any point post-treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors as assessed by RECIST v1.1, up to approximately 36 months
Number of patients with adverse events (AEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability will be assessed through AEs, via monitoring changes in physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECGs, up to approximately 36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR, proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or SD, up to approximately 36 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as time from date of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as time from the first documented CR or PR to first documented progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as time from date of treatment to death due to any cause, up to approximately 60 months|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28|Time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28
This study is being carried out in two parts, part 1 and part 2.

Part 1: This is the dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend the appropriate doses of CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib for further studies.

Part 2: This is the expansion part. The part 2 portion of this study will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of CT053PTSA and gefitinib , at the appropriate doses recommended in Part 1, in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative NSCLC.
