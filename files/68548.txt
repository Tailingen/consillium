Medical Safety Follow-up Study for Patients Who Received More Than 28 Days of Total Exposure to BGG492
To provide medical follow-up to patients exposed to BGG492 for more than 28 days in study CBGG492A2207 (NCT 01147003) and/or CBGG492A2212 (NCT 01338805).
Adrenocortical Adenoma|Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas
PROCEDURE: MRI, CT or ultrasound was permitted if MRI was contraindicated|PROCEDURE: Dexamethasone Supression Test|PROCEDURE: Sonogram|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|DRUG: BGG492
Incidence of Adrenal Cortical Adenomas, Incidence of adrenal cortical adenomas as assessed by non-contrast MRI of the abdomen (CT or ultrasound of the abdomen was permitted if MRI was contraindication), Minimum of one year after last dose of BGG492 in study BGG492A2207 or BGG492A2212|Incidence of Uterine Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas, Incidence of uterine endometrial stromal sarcomas as assessed by sonogram/biopsy (females), Minimum of one year after last dose of BGG492 in study BGG492A2207 or BGG492A2212
The purpose of the study was to provide medical follow-up to patients exposed to BGG492 for more than 28 days in study CBGG492A2207 (NCT 01147003) and/or CBGG492A2212 (NCT 01338805). Data from study CBGG492A2216 was used to support the clinical safety assessment of BGG492 regarding the observance of uterine endometrial stromal tumors and adrenal cortical adenomas at least one year after the completion of BGG492 treatment.
