Empowering Hispanic Patients' Lung Cancer Screening Uptake (Empower Latinx)
The Hispanic/Latinx community (hereafter Hispanic) is the country's second-largest racial/ethnic group, accounting for 19.1% of the total population. However, they remain one of the most underserved populations with suboptimal access to healthcare and screening services due to low income, lack of health insurance, perceived discrimination, language barriers, and limited health literacy. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality with 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide, with Hispanic patients known to have lower survival rates compared with non-Hispanic whites. Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) decreases this mortality rate of lung cancer by 20%. Yet many Latinx patients who are eligible for lung cancer screening are still falling through the cracks which prevents patients the ability to detect lung cancer early. This study will test and compare the effect of a multi-level intervention on ordering LDCT within 4 months after patient enrollment to those in an Enhanced Usual Care. Our proposed intervention includes:

* Primary care provider notifications of patients' LCS eligibility;
* Patients' education;
* Patients' referral to financial navigation resources;
* Patients' reminder to discuss LCS during primary care provider (PCP) visit.

Number of participants with order of Low-dose CT (LDCT) for lung cancer screening (LCS), Within 4 months of randomization
Number of Participants who received LDCT for LCS, Within 4 months of randomization|Number of Participants with the documented discussion of lung cancer screening with their providers in the electronic medical record, Within 4 months of randomization|Patients' perceived risk of lung cancer, 3-item perceived risk of lung cancer questionnaire developed by Carter Harris et al (Cancer Nurs, 2018) will be used. The responses for each item will be based on a 5-point likert scale. A sum score will be calculated based on responses to all 3 item. Score will range between 3 and 15. Higher score= higher perceived risk., Baseline and 4 months after randomization|Patients' perceived severity of lung cancer, 5-items about the health consequences and severity of lung cancer will be used. The responses for each item will be based on a 5-point likert scale. A sum score will be calculated based on responses to all items. Score will range between 5-25. Higher score= higher perceived benefits., Baseline and 4 months after randomization|Patients' perceived benefits of lung cancer screening, 6-item perceived benefit of lung cancer questionnaire developed by Carter Harris et al (Cancer Nurs, 2018) will be used. The responses for each item will be based on a 5-point likert scale. A sum score will be calculated based on responses to all items. Score will range between 6-30. Higher score= higher perceived benefits., Baseline and 4 months after randomization|Patients' perceived barriers of lung cancer screening, 19-item perceived barriers of lung cancer questionnaire will be used. 17 of these items were developed by Carter Harris et al (Cancer Nurs, 2018). The responses for each item will be based on a 5-point likert scale. A sum score will be calculated based on responses to all 17 validated items. Score will range between 17 and 85. Higher score= higher perceived barriers. An additional score including all 19 items will also be calculated., Baseline and 4 months after randomization|Patients' self-efficacy of lung cancer screening, 10-item self-efficacy for lung cancer screening questionnaire will be used. 9 of these items were developed by Carter Harris et al (Cancer Nurs, 2018). The responses for each item will be based on a 5-point likert scale. A sum score will be calculated based on responses to all 9 validated item. Score will range between 9 and 45. Higher score= higher self-efficacy. An additional score including all 10 items will also be calculated., Baseline and 4 months after randomization|Patients' knowledge about lung cancer screening, 9 questions adopted and modified from Volk R et al (PMID: 24518006) will be used. Responses will be based on true, false, unsure. Sum of correctly responded questions will be calculated. Higher score= higher knowledge., Baseline and 4 months after randomization
Patients' experience with intervention, Patient experience with intervention components will be assessed through qualitative interview of a subset of patients in Arm B (Empower Latinx). The results will be qualitatively described., Within 6 months after completion of the follow-ups|Providers experience with intervention, Provider experience with intervention components will be assessed through qualitative interview of a subset of providers taking care of patients in Arm B (Empower Latinx). The results will be qualitatively described., Within 3 months after last patient completion of follow-up
