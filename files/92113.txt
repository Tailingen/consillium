RCT of Ballon Technique VS Selective Ophthalmic Artery Infusion For the Retinoblastoma Patients
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in children..IAC--Targeted Treatment for Intraocular Retinoblastoma,Is minimally invasive procedure that infuse chemotherapy select into the ophthalmic artery, its can increasing the drug concentration reaching the tumor and reducing systemic toxicity compared with traditional intravenous treatment.: one is Ballon technique , another is selective ophthalmic artery infusion.This study evaluates the difference of Ballon technique and selective ophthalmic artery infusion effect in the treatment of retinoblastoma. Half of participants will receive, Ballon technique while the other half will receive selective ophthalmic artery infusion
Retinoblastoma|IAC|Selective Ophthalmic Artery Infusion|Ballon Technique
DEVICE: Ballon Technique|DEVICE: SOAI
Globe salvage rate (Eyes saved/Eyes treated), Event defined as the need for external beam enucleationï¼ŒTo assess the saving of eyes affected with IAC for patients who would have been candidates for enucleation, Three years from intervention
Visual pathway function, Evaluation of visual pathway function will be measured composite using visual acuity, electroretinogram, visual evoked potential, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, Three years from intervention|complications, Short and long term complications, Three years from intervention
Delivering the chemotherapeutic agent in the arterial system through the ophthalmic artery transforms the treatment of retinoblastoma from systemic chemotherapy to local chemotherapy. Two alternative means can be used,The purpose of this study is to show that Ballon technique and SOAI delivered directly through the artery supplying the eye (ophthalmic artery) to patients with retinoblastoma is a safe and effective treatment.
