Safety and Immunogenicity of Personalized Genomic Vaccine to Treat Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Personalized Genomic Vaccine 001 (PGV001) in subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies. PGV001 is a peptide vaccine that is based on a patient's own tumor sequence. Each patient's tumor is sequenced and peptides that correspond to the tumors are made. These peptides combined with the adjuvant Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®, Oncovir) make PGV001. The adjuvant Poly-ICLC is added to boost the immune response to the peptides and together will expand immune cells to target cancer.
