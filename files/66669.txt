Study of Adjuvant Immunotherapy With EVX-02 and Anti-PD-1
This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multi-centre study to assess the safety, tolerability, PD, and efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapy EVX-02 vaccine and anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) in patients who have had a complete resection of a Stage IIIB/IIIC/IIID or Stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence.
Melanoma Stage IV|Melanoma Stage III
DRUG: EVX-02A|DRUG: EVX-02B|DRUG: EVX-02A OR EVX-02B
Safety and tolerability (Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events), Measure through CTCAE version 5.0, Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Safety and tolerability (Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events) measure through Vital Sign- blood pressure, Measured by result of the Vital Sign- blood pressure, Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Safety and tolerability (Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events) measure through Vital Sign-heart rate, Measured by result of the Vital Sign- heart rate, Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Safety and tolerability (Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events) measure through Physical exam, Measured by result of the physical exam which includes general appearance, skin, eyes/ears/nose/throat, head and neck., Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacodynamic response (PD) of EVX-02 assessed by IFN-y ELISPOT, The pharmacodynamic (PD) response of EVX-02 will be assessed by detecting vaccine induced circulating neoepitope-specific T cells. Blood samples will be collected prior, during and after immunization and the immunotherapy induced T cell responses will be assayed by IFN-y ELISPOT., Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacodynamic response (PD) of EVX-02 assessed by MHC I multimer analysis, The pharmacodynamic (PD) response of EVX-02 will be assessed by detecting vaccine induced circulating neoepitope-specific T cells. Blood samples will be collected prior, during and after immunization. The samples will be analyzed by MHC I multimer analyses detecting neoepitope-recognizing CD8+ T cells reported as frequencies of positive cell out of CD8+ T cells., Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacodynamic response (PD) of EVX-02 by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry, The pharmacodynamic (PD) response of EVX-02 will be assessed by detecting vaccine induced circulating neoepitpe-specific T cells. Blood samples will be collected prior, during and after immunization. The samples will be analysed by flow cytometry to detect vaccine induced intracellular cytokine response, reported as frequencies of neoepitope-reactive CD4+ cells and CD8+ T cells., Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year
Efficacy measure through Relapse-free survival (RFS), Measured by result of Relapse-free survival (RFS), Measurements at Baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year
PD response of EVX-02 assessed by monitoring the quantity of cfDNA in plasma, To monitor the plasma level cfDNA, blood sample will be obtained prior, during and after treatment with EVX-02 and the fluctuations of the level cfDNA will be analysed., Measured at Screening, Day -84 to Day -1, Day 1, Day 84, Day 168, Day 252, Day 336 and early termination
This study will be conducted in two parts: a safety, efficacy and PD response part using two different drug delivery methods and an expansion cohort.

All patients will be administered with anti-PD-1 once every 4 weeks for up to 1 year commencing on Day 1 and with EVX-02 vaccine as soon as it is produced.

Part 1 will consist of two cohorts:

Cohort A: Will receive EVX- 02A delivered by delivery methodology 1. Cohort B: Will receive EVX- 02B delivered by delivery device 2. Part 2 (Cohort C) will be an expansion cohort. In this part, only one delivery methods, either EVX-02A or EVX-02B with will be used.
