The Effect of Different Doses of Remifentanil on Kidney Function During Robot Assisted Prostatectomy - A Retrospective Study
Robot assisted prostatectomy reduces the patients' postoperative pain and leads to rapid rehabilitation. But pneumoperitoneum affects the kidney. The increase of stress hormone reduces the glomerular filtration and the vaso-contraction of renal vessels leads the renal ischemia. Remifentanil is analgesics coupled with μ opioid receptor. In high dose of remifentanil, it is associated with κ and δ receptors, which leads to renal protection effect in animal study. Also, remifentanil infusion during anesthesia showed a diuretic effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the remifentanil effect on renal function during robot assisted prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer
acute kidney injury incidence based on Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, Acute kidney injury incidence based on Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria was defined as increase in serum creatinine from baseline of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within a 48-hour period. Acute kidney injury is evaluated at POD 1., 24 hours after end of surgery
