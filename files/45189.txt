Application of Endoscopic Scissors Cutting ENBD Tube in the Treatment of Malignant Hilar Biliary Strictures
The purpose of this study is to evaluate application value of the endoscopic cutting technique in the treatment of malignant hilar biliary strictures.
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography|Klatskin Tumor
DEVICE: Endoscopic scissors|DEVICE: Biliary stent
occurrence of acute cholangitis, Acute cholangitis is defined as cholangitis that occurred within 30 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP)., 30 days
Clinical success, Clinical success was defined as a decrease in the total bilirubin level to ≤50% of the pretreatment value within 1 week or to ≤75% within 4 weeks., 30 days|Re-intervention, Re-intervention was defined as any type of endoscopic or percutaneous procedure necessary to improve biliary drainage for jaundice or cholangitis after successful placement., 6 months
early adverse, Early adverse event was defined as any ERCP-related adverse event within 4 weeks and a late event was defined as one that occurred after 4 weeks., 30 days
The management unresectable malignant hilar biliary strictures is still very difficult in spite of the rapid development of new endoscopic devices.The application of stent (plastic or metallic) has allowed us to achieve successful drainage. However,there are many complications related to the placement of stents,such as cholangitis,high rate of re-intervention,and so on. The application of endoscopic cutting technique is considered to reduce these complication.
