Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Link With Oral Cancer and Premalignant Lesions
Aim: The current study targets linking serum and salivary dipeptidyl peptidase-4 with oral squamous cell carcinoma and comparing it with potentially malignant lesions and control to validate dipeptidyl peptidase-4 as a diagnostic marker for early detection of oral cancer and to reveal its possible role in carcinogenesis.

Methodology: A total of 45 patients were recruited and subdivided into 2 groups: Group I: 15 patients having oral squamous cell carcinoma. Group II: 15 patients with potentially malignant lesions (leukoplakia and oral lichen planus) compared to 15 systemically healthy participants having no oral mucosal lesions acting as a control group (Group III). Serum and whole unstimulated salivary samples were collected from all participants to evaluate dipeptidyl peptidase level in different groups using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) kit. ROC analysis was done to reveal area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of DPP-4 among different groups.
Oral Premalignant Lesions as Leukoplakia and Lichen Planus|Oral Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: serum and unstimulated salivary samples
DPP-4 level detection, level of DPP-4 is measured in all collected serum and salivary samples, level of DPP-4 is measured after the completion of all sample collection carried at the day of enrollment of subjects in the investigation after diagnosis confirmation
