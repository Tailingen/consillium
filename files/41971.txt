Mecapegfilgrastim With Chemotherapy for Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Mobilization in MM and Lymphoma
This is a multicenter prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with a single dose of subcutaneous(SC) injection mecapegfilgrastim on day 2 or day 5 after chemotherapy for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma.

Subjects eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation are randomized to receive a single dose of 12mg mecapegfilgrastim SC on day 2 or day 5 after chemotherapy for PBSC mobilization. According to the protocol, high-dose cyclophosphamide (50mg/kg or 2g/m2, for 2 days) is given to patients with MM, and high-dose etoposide (1.5-1.8g/m2, single dose ) is administered to patients with lymphoma. Apheresis is performed according to the standard institutional regulations. The primary point is to evaluate the percentage of successful mobilization, defined as the cumulative collection of ≥2×10\^6/kg CD34+ cells in three or fewer apheresis.
