Randomized Phase II Study of ADT + Abiraterone vs ADT + Docetaxel + Abiraterone
This is a phase II, randomized, open label study comparing first line therapy with AThis is a phase II, randomized, open label study comparing first line therapy with ADT + abiraterone (doublet arm) or ADT + abiraterone + docetaxel (triplet arm) in low volume, metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).

This is a phase II, randomized, open label study comparing first line therapy with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) + abiraterone (doublet arm) or ADT + abiraterone + docetaxel (triplet arm) in low volume, metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).

The hypothesis being asked in this trial is whether first line treatment with ADT plus an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (abiraterone) as a doublet regimen compared to ADT plus an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (abiraterone) and docetaxel, as a triplet regimen results in superior outcomes for patients with low volume mHSPC.

We plan to enroll patients with mHPSC that meet the CHAARTED criteria for low disease volume. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either treatment arm:

* doublet arm: abiraterone +ADT or
* triplet arm: abiraterone + ADT + docetaxel.

All subjects must receive ADT of the Investigator's choice (LHRH agonist/antagonists or orchiectomy) as standard therapy, started = 12 weeks before randomization.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: ADT|DRUG: Abiraterone
Assess Progression Free Survival (PFS), Calculated the progression-free survival time as the time that elapses between the date of randomization and the day of first documented disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3) or death from any cause for all evaluable patients. PFS will be calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT compared to abiraterone+ADT)., Up to 1 year after completion of study treatment
Assess Overall Survival (OS), To assess the OS, this is defined as the time from date of randomization until time to death from any cause for all evaluable patients. OS will be calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS., Up to 1 year after completion of study treatment|Assess PSA Response Rate, The PSA level drawn 6 months (+/- 30 days) after randomization will be used to assess PSA response., 6 months (+/- 30 days) after randomization|Assessment of Time to castration resistant prostate cancer, This endpoint will calculate the time to the development of castration resistance from date of randomization to the time of PSA progression with serum testosterone level being at â‰¤ 50 ng/ml, Up to 1 year after completion of study treatment|Assess time to compare for any difference in efficacy between arms, This endpoint will calculate the time to the initiation of the subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy for each treatment arm from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of the next (non-study) anti-neoplastic agent for prostate cancer., Up to 1 year after completion of study treatment
Assess Quality of Life (QoL), FACT-P QoL assessment tool for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy, Time between the initiation of trial therapy to 30 days from the last dose of study drug|Assessment of Rates of Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious adverse events (SAEs), To assess the rate of adverse events for each treatment arm. Safety will be measured as the frequency of AEs by type, severity (grade), timing and attribution to trial therapy (per NCI CTCAE v5.0)., Time between the initiation of trial therapy to 30 days from the last dose of study drug
Primary Objective:

1. To assess Progression Free Survival (PFS) for each treatment arms (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy

Secondary Objective:

1. To assess Overall Survival (OS) for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy
2. To assess PSA Response Rate for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy
3. To assess ORR with measurable disease at baseline for each treatment arm for (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy
4. Assessment of Time to castration resistant prostate cancer for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy
5. Assess time to initiation of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy

Exploratory Objectives:

1. Assess Quality of Life (QoL) via the FACT-P QoL assessment tool (Appendix A QoL Survey FACT-P) for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in efficacy
2. Assessment of Rates of Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious adverse events (SAEs) for each treatment arm (abiraterone+docetaxel+ADT and abiraterone+ADT) to compare for any difference in safety
