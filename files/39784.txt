A Study of Molecular Residual, Dynamic Monitoring and Recurrence of Stage III Driver Mutated NSCLC
The goal of this prospective, observational study is to explore the value of dynamic monitoring of minimal residual lesions in driver mutated stage III NSCLC for disease recurrence and prognosis assessment. The main question it aims to answer is:

1) Whether MRD(Minimal residual disease) status can predict recurrence events in stage III driven-mutant NSCLC in advance
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRD
Correlation of MRD status in driver gene-positive NSCLC patients with 12-month relapse events, Patients are defined as MRD positive if lung cancer driver genes are detected in peripheral blood post-surgery using NGS methods, and radiological recurrence is based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 2022.12--2025.03
Correlation of MRD status in driver gene-positive NSCLC patients with RFS, Patients are defined as MRD positive if lung cancer driver genes are detected in peripheral blood post-surgery using NGS methods, and radiological recurrence is based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 2022.12--2025.03|Correlation of MRD status in driver gene-positive NSCLC patients with OS, Patients are defined as MRD positive if the NGS method detects lung cancer driver gene positivity in the peripheral blood post-surgery., 2022.12--2025.03|Correlation of MRD status in driver gene-positive NSCLC patients with 24-month relapse events, Patients are defined as MRD positive if lung cancer driver genes are detected in peripheral blood post-surgery using NGS methods, and radiological recurrence is based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 2022.12--2025.03
Non-small cell lung cancer in stage III (IIIa, IIIIb, IIIc) has a low survival rate, and the 5-year survival rate of stage III patients is less than 30%. In clinical studies of non-small cell lung cancer operable stage III driver gene mutations, postoperative targeted adjuvant therapy improves patient survival relative to postoperative chemotherapy.

The tumor patients still have residual malignant tumor cells in vivo during or after treatment, and minimal residual foci are released during cell necrosis or apoptosis. Early the domestic large lung cancer MRD((Minimal residual disease)) prospective research results, for the first time through the dynamic monitoring of MRD high negative predictive value defined the potential cure population, found that postoperative MRD negative population could not benefit from adjuvant therapy, clarify the existence of preoperative Non-shedding tumor does not affect postoperative MRD monitoring, and exploring the stage II / III MRD turn high risk of postoperative lung cancer. Therefore, for nearly 70% of patients with driver gene-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, detecting clear driver gene mutations in the peripheral blood is expected to stratify the risk of recurrence/progression.
