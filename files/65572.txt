Study to Assess Xevinapant in Preoperative Subjects With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma (rHGG)
Researchers will investigate the ability of Xevinapant to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert anti-tumor effects on rHGG through activation of apoptosis. Researchers hypothesize that oral administration of Xevinapant has acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with recurrent HGG and demonstrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in HGG tumors. To that end, Researchers will engage in a phase I "window of opportunity" translational clinical trial in patients undergoing a clinically-indicated craniotomy for resection of recurrent tumors to evaluate the impact of treatment on rHGG.
Recurrent High-grade Glioma
DRUG: Xevinapant
Concentration of Xevinapant, Concentration of unbound Xevinapant in brain tumor tissue in an exploratory manner (within contrast enhancing tumor as well as non-enhancing tumor, wherever possible) at the time of planned salvage resection., Within 48 hours of last dose of Xevinapant.|Concentration max (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration of Xevinapant., Within 48 hours of last dose of Xevinapant.
Occurrence of AE's and SAE's, The number of patients who experience AE's and SAE's., Up to 12 months.
