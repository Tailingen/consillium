Physical Activity for Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors
More adolescents and young adults are surviving cancer than ever before. Many endure negative effects related to their cancer and its treatment, which reduces their quality of life and functioning. Physical activity is one strategy that has been shown to promote quality of life amongst cancer survivors. However, very little research has focused on adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to explore the feasibility, safety, and potential benefits of a 12-week home-based physical activity intervention in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.
