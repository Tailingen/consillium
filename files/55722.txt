Ivosidenib (TIBSOVOÂ®) Combined With Azacitidine According to Current SmPC
The goal of this non-interventional study is to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with newly diagnosed IDH1 R132-mutated AML who are not eligible to receive standard induction chemotherapy and who are treated with ivosidenib in combination with azacitidine in a real-world setting in Germany.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Evaluate QoL by validated and widely used Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Leukemia (FACT-Leu) questionnaire and European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire during treatment and follow-up period
* Assesment of effectiveness in routine treatment (e.g. overall survival, event-free survival, overall response rate)
* Assessment of drug safety (all adverse events)
* Description of treatment reality in detail
