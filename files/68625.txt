A Phase 2 Trial of Anakinra for the Prevention of CAR-T Cell Mediated Neurotoxicity
This research study is studying the combination of anakinra and axicabtagene ciloleucel to reduce the occurrence of the side effects Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

* Relapsed NHL is the condition of returned Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
* Refractory NHL is the condition of previous treatment resistant Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
* Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a group of side effect symptoms that can include nausea, headache, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, kidney damage, and rash.
* Neurologic toxicity is nervous system disorder characterized by confusion

This research study involves two drugs:

* Anakinra
* Axicabtagene Ciloleucel.

Rate of Neurotoxicity as Per CTCAE v4.03 Criteria, The incidence of grade 2+ neurotoxicity is reported below and was assessed using CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.04 criteria. Neurotoxicity is a serious side effect of cancer treatments that can impact the central and peripheral nervous systems. Neurotoxicity manifestations vary and can include confusion, obtundation, seizures, hallucinations, aphasia, ataxia, and more rarely, profound cerebral edema., 30 Days
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the incidence of either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) by the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. All participants who don't meet the ORR criteria by the analysis data cutoff date will be considered non-responders.

* CR = complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease related symptoms if present before therapy; PET scan negative; lymph nodes/nodal masses regressed to normal size; normal size spleen/liver on CT scan; bone marrow aspirate and biopsy shows no evidence of disease by morphology or negative by IHC.
* PR = ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses; no size increase of nodes/liver/spleen; no new sites of disease; post-treatment PET scan positive in ≥ 1 previously involved site., 24 Months|Duration of Response, Among participants who experience an objective response, duration of response (DOR) is defined as the date of their first objective response to disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, or death regardless of cause. Participants not meeting the criteria for progressive disease (PD) or death by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date and their response will be noted as ongoing.

\* PD = ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes; ≥ 50% increase in product of the diameters of single node; new lesion \>1.5 cm; ≥ 50% size increase of splenic/hepatic nodules; ≥ 50% increase in longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis; PET scan positive, first objective response to disease progression death regardless of cause up 24 Months|Progression-free Survival, Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for progression-free survival time, infusion date to the date of disease progression or death from any cause up 24 Months|Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated for OS., time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death or analysis data cutoff date will be censored at last contact date up to 24 months.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade 3 or Higher, Subject incidence rates of adverse events including all, serious, fatal, CTCAE version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher and treatment related AEs reported throughout the conduct of the study will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class, 24 Months|Rate of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) as Per Lee 2014 for CRS, The incidence of max grade 2+ CRS will be assessed, Within 30 days after infusion
This Phase 2, single center, open-label research study is studying the combination of Anakinra and Axicabtagene Ciloleucel to reduce the occurrence of the side effects Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities in people with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

* This research study involves two drugs:

  * Anakinra
  * Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
* A total of 20 participants are anticipated to be enrolled to this trial
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved anakinra for use in treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
