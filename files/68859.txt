Intensified Treatment With Carfilzomib in Myeloma Patients Still PET-positive After First Line Treatment.
A PET-CT will be performed on patients with myeloma after a standard first-line treatment. The PET-positive patients will receive 4 cycles of Carfilzomb-Revlimid-Dexamethason (KRd), before a new PET-CT will be performed.

PET negativity after induction, How many of PET positive patients will become PET negative after treatment, 1 month after induction
PET correlation with MRD Euroflow, Before intervention all patients are PET-CT positive. The investigators will measure minimal residual disease (MRD) with immuno-flow cytometry, at the same timepoint, and describe how many of the PET-CT patients, are MRD-negative and how many are MRD-positive. After the intervention the investigators will again do PET-CT and MRD by flow cytometry. The investigators will then describe how many PET-positive patients are MRD-positive and how many are MRD-negative. As well, the investigators will describe the same in the PET-CT negative patients., 1 month after induction
Patients will be evaluated for inclusion after finishing first-line therapy, or after a sufficient amount of treatment in first-line, and a sufficient respons (VGPR). Eligible performed regimens are defined in the protocol. All patients will perform a PET-CT, and PET-negative patients will be excluded from protocol treatment. The PET-positive patients will do a minimal residual disease (MRD-)evaluation in the bone marrow before entering treatment. After 4 28day cycles of Carfilzomib-Revlimid-Dexamethason, a new MRD and a new PET-CT will be performed, as measures of outcome. Patients will continue treatment as written in the protocol.
