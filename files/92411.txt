Surveillance MRI Registry for Patients Who Had Breast Cancer With Dense Breast Tissue
To create a registry (database) of participants who come in for breast MRI scans. Researchers want to use this information to study if participants with dense breast tissue (tissue that is more difficult to see on mammogram).
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire/Interview
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

- To determine the number of false positive biopsies obtained from surveillance MRI in participant with personal history of breast cancer, age 50 or under, and mammographically dense breasts.

Secondary Objectives

I. To determine the incidence of interval cancer.

II. To compare participants with personal history of breast cancer, age 50 and under, who did not receive surveillance MRI.

III. To determine positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of surveillance breast MRI in this population.

IV. To compare the tumor biology of breast cancer detected on breast MRI.

V. To determine the participants experience with MRI i.e. willingness to return for testing with breast MRI.

VI. To evaluate the reasons women refuse breast MRI for the surveillance of recurrent disease or secondary breast cancer.

VII. To determine the patients' interest in having procedural hypnosis to improve patient reported acceptance of breast MRI among participants.
