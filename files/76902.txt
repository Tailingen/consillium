Cryoablation Versus Medical Therapy in Desmoid Tumors Progressing After Watchful Waiting
"Wait \& see" is currently the standard of care of recently diagnosed desmoid tumors (DT). In case of progression or symptomatic disease, medical therapy is nowadays widely used including chemotherapy.

Cryoablation has proven to be beneficial for the treatment of large, progressive and symptomatic DT.

This randomized phase II trial aims to compare cryoablation versus medical therapy in DT patients progressing after the "wait \& see" period. Moreover, a cross-over design has been anticipated to allow all patients to undergo cryoablation if necessary.
Desmoid Tumor

Rate of non-progressive disease, Rates of non-progressive disease (sum of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to modified RECIST criteria), 12 months after treatment initiation (Day 0+12months)
Progression-free survival 1, Progression-free survival 1 (PFS1: from the beginning of cryoablation or medical therapy to first disease progression) in cryoablation and medical therapy group, from treatment initiation to PD or 24 months whichever comes first|Rate of patients who cross over to the other arm, 24 months after treatment initiation|Rate of complete response, Rate of complete response at 12 months in cryoablation and medical therapy group with and without a cross-over treatment, 12 months after treatment initiation and 12 months after cross-over|Secondary Progression-free survival 2, Secondary Progression-free survival 2 (PFS 2: from the cross-over to second disease progression) in cryoablation and medical therapy group, Through study completion, up to 39 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 toxicity scale, The occurrence of complications and adverse reactions according to the classification of the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 toxicity scale, Through study completion, up to 39 months|QUALITY OF LIFE assessed by EUROQOL EQ 5D before and after treatment, EUROQOL EQ 5D will be used; score ranging from 1 (good quality of life) to 5 (poor quality of life), Screening visit, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12 after treatment initiation|PAIN assessed by brief pain inventory (BPI) before and after treatment, BPI will be used; score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (high pain), Screening visit, Day 0/Day 1, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12 after treatment initiation|Health economics assessment, cost and incremental cost utility ratio, Through study completion, up to 39 months
