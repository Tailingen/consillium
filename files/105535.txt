Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Combined With Irinotecan (AI Regimen) Versus VIT Regimen in the Treatment of First Relapsed and Refractory Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma: a Prospective, Open-label, Randomized Controlled, Multicenter, Phase II Clinical Study
This multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, prospective clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with irinotican (AI regimen) versus VIT regimen in the treatment of first relapsed and refractory pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma, Child
DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome+Irinotecan|DRUG: Temozolomide+Irinotecan+Vincristine
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) after 2 cycles of chemotherapy with AI or VIT regimen, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), up to 2 cycles of chemotherapy（each cycle is 21 days）
Disease control rate (DCR), Refers to the percentage of patients with confirmed complete response, partial response, and disease stability in patients with evaluable efficacy., up to 2 cycles of chemotherapy|Progression-free survival (PFS), Means from the date of enrollment to the date of first disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. If the subject has no disease progression during the trial period, PFS is defined as the last date until the subject's last confirmed progression-free survival., From date of radomization unit the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 moths|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., From date of radomization unit the date of first documented date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 moths|Adverse events (AE), The safety of the drug was evaluated by NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard., Time from the date of enrollment to 30 days after the last dose.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of first relapsed and refractory rhabdomyosarcoma in children after 2 cycles of chemotherapy with AI or VIT regimens. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of AI and VIT regimen in the treatment of relapsed and refractory pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma.
