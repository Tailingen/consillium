Total-body PET/CT Imaging Using the uEXPLORER in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated by Induction Chemotherapy Plus Nivolumab and Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy
The prospective study aims to explore the value of total-body PET/CT dynamic imaging (uExplorer) in assessing tumor metabolic heterogeneity and predicting prognosis for patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (stage III) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nivolumab and definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy.
