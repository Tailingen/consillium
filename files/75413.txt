Pediatric Oncology Recovery Trial After Surgery
Pediatric Oncologic Recovery Trial After Surgery (PORTS) trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, multidisciplinary prospective case-control study of the implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol at five tertiary-care pediatric hospitals in pediatric patients undergoing abdominal or retroperitoneal surgical resections for cancer. A pilot phase will determine characteristics of a successful protocol implementation and an exploratory phase plans to examine adherence, objective patient outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. After completing primary enrollment, this collaborative will continue to enroll patients in the shared data registry and continue to refine the underlying ERAS protocol developed for this project.
