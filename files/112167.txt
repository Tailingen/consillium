Adequacy Assessment of Bronchoscopic Biopsy Samples Using a Novel Instrument
The goal of this study is to learn whether the Ruby Robotics system enables pathologists to determine whether a bronchoscopic biopsy sample is adequate for diagnosis. The main question it aims to answer is:

- Are pathologists' evaluations of Ruby digital images concordant with their evaluations of manually created rapid on-site evaluation slides?
