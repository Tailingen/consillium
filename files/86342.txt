Nivolumab in Association With Radiotherapy and Cisplatin in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancers Followed by Adjuvant Nivolumab for up to 6 Months
To date, the majority of clinical trials on checkpoint inhibitors have tested these agents as monotherapy, and the next logical step is to evaluate rational therapeutic associations. The aim of the NiCOL study is to assess the safety of nivolumab in association with chemoradiation therapy and to gain initial insight into its efficacy in association with the current standard of care, including chemoradiation.
Cervical Cancer|Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab Injection|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: radiotherapy
rate of occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as any of the following treatment-related adverse events or laboratory abnormalities, graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0:

* non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3;
* immune-related adverse event ≥ grade 3;
* symptomatic immune-related adverse event ≥ grade 2 resistant to optimal supportive care for \> 7 days;
* dosing delay in RT ≥ 1 week due to toxicity related to nivolumab, chemotherapy or RT;
* colitis or diarrhea ≥ grade 3., within 11 weeks after the initiation of treatment.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of all subjects whose best response is either a complete response or a partial response., after the end of RT and before brachytherapy and again up to 2 months after brachytherapy|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the length of time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death, regardless of the cause of death, 2 years|Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the length of time from the start of complete response to the time of relapse from complete response. DFS applies only to patients in complete response., 2 years|Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to assess the overall safety profile of the association of nivolumab and pelvic radio-chemotherapy, from the first intake of the IMP until 100 days after the last intake of the IMP|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) to assess the overall safety profile of the association of nivolumab and pelvic radio-chemotherapy, from the first intake of the IMP until 100 days after the last intake of the IMP|validation of molecular alterations detected by molecular analyses, Retrospective exome, RNA and targeted sequencing analyses will be performed on all patients treated and for whom tumor samples are available., 2 years|ctDNA heterogeneity, Retrospective exome and targeted sequencing analyses will be performed on all patients treated and for whom tissue samples are available at the different timepoints, baseline, at Weeks 3, 6 and 12 and every 12 weeks up to Week 104|tumor microenvironment description, phenotypic analysis of the different components of the tumor microenvironment using various technologies, 2 years|tumor PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, 2 years
