PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With Decitabine Followed by ASCT as Second-line Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Young patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma will be treated with PD-1 inhibitor combined with decitabine as second-line salvage treatment for four cycles. If PR or CR was obtained after salvage treatment, patients will receive GBM conditioning regimen followed by ASCT as consolidation therapy. High-risk R/R cHL patients will be treated with PD-1 inhibitor after ASCT for 1 year. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor combined with decitabine followed by ASCT as second-line treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.
