Development of a Culturally Tailored Resilience-building Intervention for Chinese American's Advance Care Planning Discussions
Less than 15% of Chinese Americans complete advance directives. That is less than half of the 37% completion rate in the US general population. This disparity in the use of advance care planning between White Americans and Chinese Americans may extend to disparities in end-of-life care. To address such disparities in end-of-life care, we will develop and assess the acceptability of a culturally tailored resilience-building intervention to help Chinese Americans with cancer or heart disease and their family caregivers engage in advance care planning discussions.

BEHAVIORAL: Culturally tailored resilience-building intervention
Acceptability, The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, which ranges from 1 to 5, will be used to assess acceptability. A higher score indicates higher acceptability., Immediately at the end of the usability testing
The overall objective of this cross-sectional pilot study is to develop a culturally tailored resilience-building intervention for Chinese Americans with cancer or heart disease in Chicago. A qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews will be conducted to identify how religious leaders addressed death-related topics with Chinese Americans with cancer or heart disease in Chicago. In addition, a usability test of a resilience-building intervention prototype will be conducted to to understand the feasibility and acceptability among 18 pairs of Chinese Americans and their family caregivers (9 pairs with cancer and 9 pairs with heart disease).
