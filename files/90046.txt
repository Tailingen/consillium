TGRX-326 Pharmacokinetic Food Effect Bioavailability Study
A study evaluating the effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of TGRX-326 and the effect of different drug specifications on human bioavailability for TGRX-326, a drug indicated for non-small cell lung cancer treatment

This study is designed as single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-cycle, 6-sequence and crossover design to evaluate 1) food effect on PK profile of TGRX-326; 2) effect of different specifications of TGRX-326 on human bioavailability. Safety for food effect on TGRX-326 and safety for different TGRX-326 specifications were also evaluated.
