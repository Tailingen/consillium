A Study of Oncolytic Virus Injection (RT-01) in Combination With PD-1 Inhibitor in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate safety and efficacy of oncolytic virus injection(RT-01) in combination with PD-1 inhibitor (Nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, The immunoreactivity, The immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01 in combination with PD-1 inhibitor.

This is an investigator initiated , single-arm, open-label study of RT-01 as a single agent given via Intravenous injection（IV）with or without Intratumoral injection（IT） in combination with IV Nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study is planned to enroll 40-50 patients with advanced solid tumors. RT-01 will be administered as a single dose on day 1, Nivolumab will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks starting on day 5.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, The immunoreactivity, The immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01 in combination with PD-1 Inhibitor (Nivolumab).
