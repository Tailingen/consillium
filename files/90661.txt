Prospective Assessment of Radiation-induced Heart Injury in Left-sided Breast Cancer
This study is to prospectively investigate the cardiac dose-sparing effect and clinical benefit of deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. Patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is enrolled. Radiotherapy is delivered with either free-breathing or deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. The cardiac dose parameters and cardiac toxicity are prospective evaluated, and the dose-effect relationship is analyzed.

Number of participants with treatment-related cardiac adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, The cardiac adverse events are regularly assessed with cardiac symptoms,cardiac enzymes(TnTï¼ŒBNP),electrocardiogram(ECG) and normal gated single-photon emission computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging., up to 2 years
Patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery are prospectively enrolled. Two types of radiation treatment are delivered based on attending physician's preferences: radiation to whole breast +- regional nodal areas with free-breathing technique, or with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. The cardiac dose parameters including heart dose and the dose to left anterior coronary artery are assessed, and the cardiac toxicities regularly assessed with cardiac enzymes,electrocardiogram(ECG) and normal gated single-photon emission computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging before, during and after radiation.The dose-effect relationship of heart injuries is analyzed.
