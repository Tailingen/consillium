Dose-escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Briciclib in Advanced Solid Tumors
The main objectives of this study are to determine the safety profile of briciclib, an experimental anti-cancer drug, as it is administered intravenously once weekly as escalating doses in adult patients with advanced cancer and solid tumors, and to determine the highest dose of briciclib that can be safely given. Secondary objectives are to determine how the amount of briciclib in circulation changes over time and how much briciclib gets into the urine for excretion, and to document potential anti-tumor effects of briciclib.
Neoplasms|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: briciclib
Number of patients with adverse events, Adverse events will be grouped by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and will be summarized by worst grade according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0., Up to 1 year|Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as an adverse event that is considered to be drug-related and meets one of the Protocol definitions., Up to 3 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be defined during the Dose Escalation Stage based on evaluation of the number of patients with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT). The MTD will be used to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD)., 3 weeks
Concentration of briciclib in the plasma, The amount of briciclib in the plasma of patients in the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) Confirmation stage only will be measured by a validated Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) method. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from the concentration versus time values., 24 hours|Concentration of briciclib in the urine, The amount of briciclib in the urine of patients in the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) Confirmation stage only will be measured by a validated Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) method. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from the concentration versus time values., 24 hours|Change in size of tumors, Change in the overall tumor will be determined from the tumor burden at Baseline following Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 1 year
Biomarker Concentration or Activity, An exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate the biological effect of briciclib on cell-cycle pathways, cyclin D1, and other potential surrogate biomarker(s) of efficacy and/or toxicity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC)., Up to 1 year
This will be a Phase I, 2-stage, open-label, dose-escalating, multicenter study of the 2-hour, once-a-week intravenous (IV) administration of briciclib in 3-week cycles, in up to 54 adult patients with advanced cancer and solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 stages: a dose-escalation stage to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) confirmation stage. Patients with stable disease (SD) or response may remain treated on study until progression.
