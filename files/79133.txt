Exercise, Fitness and Tumor Profiling in Breast Cancer Patients
This study is designed to find out how engaging in regular exercise (or not) alters the biology of breast tumors as well as the normal tissue (if available) surrounding the tumor. The investigators hope that findings from this initial study will guide the design of future studies to examine how changes in exercise alter breast tumor biology.
