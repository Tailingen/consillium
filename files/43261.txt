Study of Efficacy and Safety of BCD-217 (Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1) Followed By BCD-100 (Anti-PD-1) Versus BCD-100 Monotherapy as First-Line Treatment in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
This is a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of therapy consisting of BCD-217 (fixed dose combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies) and sequential BCD-100 (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) versus BCD-100 monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with treatment-naïve unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
