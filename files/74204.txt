A Phase 2 Study of the Ketogenic Diet vs Standard Anti-cancer Diet Guidance for Patients With Glioblastoma in Combination With Standard-of-care Treatment
This is a Phase 2, randomized two-armed, multi-site study of 170 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive Keto Diet, or Standard Anti-Cancer Diet. All patients will receive standard of care treatment for their glioblastoma. The Keto Diet intervention will be for an 18-week period and conducted by trained research dietitians. Daily ketone and glucose levels will be recorded to monitor Keto Diet adherence.

This two-armed randomized multi-site study aims to provide evidence to support the hypothesis that a Keto Diet vs. Standard Anti-Cancer Diet improves overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients who receive standard of care treatment.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
BEHAVIORAL: Keto Diet|BEHAVIORAL: Standard Anti-Cancer Diet
Overall survival, Will be calculated as the number of days from the date of patient registration to the date of death., From Baseline to 18 Months
Health-related quality of life 1, Measured by changes in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-BR) survey scores. Scores can range from 0- 200, the higher the score the better the quality of life., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Health-related quality of life 2, Measured by changes in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) survey scores. Scores can range from 0- 160, the higher the score the better the quality of life., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Progression-free survival, Assessed with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain with and without gadolinium. MRI's will be reviewed and assessed for progression free survival via the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Cognitive performance 1, Measured by changes in the Hopkins Verbal Test (HVLT-R) survey scores. Scores can range from 0-36, higher the scores the better the cognitive performance., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Cognitive performance 2, Measured by changes in the Trail Marking Test A/B survey scores. The longer the task takes to complete the lower the cognitive performance., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Physical activity, Measured by changes in the modified Godin leisure questionnaire survey scores. The more minutes per week spent in exercise the better the physical activity., From Baseline to 18 Weeks|Physical activity, Measured by Fitbit data changes. The higher the step count the better the physical activity., From Baseline to 18 Weeks
