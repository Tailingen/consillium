Pentostatin and Alemtuzumab as a Preparative Regimen for Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
This study tests the hypothesis that a purely immunosuppressive preparative regimen allows engraftment of related or unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells in subjects with high-risk malignancies, without causing the post-transplant myelosuppression (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) that occurs with currently used reduced-intensity (nonmyeloablative) preparative regimens. This study incorporates both safety and efficacy endpoints and evaluates a novel preparative regimen of alemtuzumab plus continuous-infusion pentostatin, two immunosuppressive agents with different mechanisms of action, in recipients of related or unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

DRUG: Pentostatin|BIOLOGICAL: Alemtuzumab|PROCEDURE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Actuarial Probability of Donor Hematopoietic Engraftment (Defined as at Least 50% Donor DNA in Bone Marrow at Day 100)., The number of participants with donor hematopoietic engraftment at day 100 is reported in the data table, and the actuarial probability is calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate statistic, as reported in the statistical analysis section below., Day 100 after transplant.|Non-relapse Mortality at or Before Day 100, The primary safety outcome is indicated by the number of participants who died at or before Day 100 after transplant for any reason other than relapse of disease (Leukemia, Lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Hematologic Neoplasms, Multiple Myeloma, Renal Cell Carcinoma)., Day 100 after transplant
Primary Objectives of the study:

* To determine the efficacy of a preparative regimen of pentostatin and alemtuzumab plus related or unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in inducing durable donor lymphohematopoietic cell chimerism (defined as at least 50% donor cells in the peripheral blood) by 100 days after PBSCT (day +100) in subjects with high-risk malignancies who are at high risk for morbidity and mortality with conventional intensive pre-transplant conditioning regimens.
* To determine the safety of a preparative regimen of pentostatin and alemtuzumab plus related or unrelated allogeneic PBSCT, as measured by the non-relapse mortality at day +100 in the study subject population.
