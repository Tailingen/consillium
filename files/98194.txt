Simultaneous Portal and Hepatic Vein Versus Portal Vein Embolizations for Hypertrophy of the Future Liver Remnant
The hypothesis is that liver venous deprivation (LVD) could strongly improve hypertrophy of the future remnant liver (FRL) at 3 weeks, as compared to portal vein embolization (PVE) in patient with liver metastases from colo-rectal origin considered as resectable.

Portal vein embolization (PVE) has been widely used to generate hypertrophy of the nonembolized lobe in patients undergoing major hepatectomy in order to prevent small-for-size remnant liver resulting in post-operative liver insufficiency.

Although PVE is a safe and effective procedure, it does not always induce sufficient hypertrophy of the future remnant liver (FRL) even after a long time. In case of insufficient liver regeneration following PVE, some authors suggested to embolize hepatic vein(s) (Hwang, Ann Surg 2009).

Interestingly, the sequential right hepatic vein embolization (HVE) after right PVE demonstrated an incremental effect on the FRL. Although attractive, this approach requires two different procedures and does not spare time as compared to PVE alone.

To shorten and optimize the phase of liver preparation before surgery,the so-called liver venous deprivation (LVD) technique that combines both PVE and HVE during the same procedure was developed.

The aim of this randomized phase II trial is to compare the percentage of change in FRL volume at 3 weeks after LVD or PVE using MRI or CT-scan.
