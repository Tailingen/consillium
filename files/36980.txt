De Novo Resistance to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
This study is based on the following hypothesis "De novo resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFR mutation positive patients is related with mutations in EGFR downstream genes".

Investigators will prospectively collect genomic DNA and clinical data regarding treatment outcomes to EGFR-TKI in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations. Investigators will sequence candidate mutations of EGFR downstream genes and analyze c-met gene amplification and protein expression in PTEN, HGF, and IGFR. To identify genetic mutations, amplification, and protein over expression as predictive markers of treatment outcomes, investigators analyzed the association of treatment outcomes with the presence of genetic alteration or protein over expression. Investigators will attempt to identify biomarkers that are able to predict de novo resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFR mutated NSCLC.
NSCLC
hazard rates of PFS, The primary objective is to compare hazard rates of PFS in patients treated with Iressa between with and without any molecular aberrancy in EGFR-downstream genes/proteins., 1year
OS, Overall survival (OS) of EGFR-TKI according to each biomarker (i.e. PIK3CA, AKT, PTEN, and STK11 mutation and HGF, c-met, and IGFR amplification) Disease control rate (DCR) of EGFR-TKI according to each biomarker (i.e. PIK3CA, AKT, PTEN, and STK11 mutation and HGF, c-met, and IGFR amplification) Progression-free survival (PFS) of EGFR-TKI according to each biomarker (i.e. PIK3CA, AKT, PTEN, and STK11 mutation and HGF, c-met, and IGFR amplification), 2years
Investigators will prospectively enroll patients who match the following criteria: pathologically proven unresectable NSCLC, planning to treat with EGFR-TKI, patients with activating EGFR mutations, and available tissue sample for DNA extraction.
