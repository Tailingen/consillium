Fruquintinib in Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Real-world Study
Fruquintinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Here, we explore the real-world treatment patterns of fruquintinib in the third- or late-line setting for mCRC in six centers in China.
