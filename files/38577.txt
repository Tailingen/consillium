A Study of Letrozole in the Treatment of Endometrial Cancer
Currently available treatments for endometrial cancer are associated with limited efficacy and significant toxicity. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, on endometrial cancer.
Recurrent and Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Letrozole
Response rates (complete response, partial response, no change, progressive disease) measured by tumor marker assessments and radiologic imaging at week 12 then every 12 weeks x 1 year followed by every 16 weeks
Duration of clinical response, time to progression of the disease, correlation of tumor response with pretreatment ER/PR status, histological grade and aromatase levels
