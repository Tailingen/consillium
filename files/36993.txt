Post-operative Radiotherapy in Poor Responders Ewing's Sarcoma Patients
Local recurrence after surgical resection is a complex phenomenon. An important predictive factor is the response to chemotherapy. Central site of disease may be a second independent predictive factor (Lin et al. 2007). Patients with more than 10% viable tumour cells at surgery following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had a less favourable outcome with an Event-free Survival \[EFS\] of 47% after 10 years. Patients with good histological response (\< 10% viable tumour cells) after chemotherapy alone had a prognosis of about 70% after 10 years.

However, further studies are necessary to determine the merit of adjuvant radiation for high-risk patients (poor responders). Taking into consideration that the toxicity and morbidity of combined surgery and radiation is greater than either alone and must be closely monitored.
