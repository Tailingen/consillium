Primary Objectives:

The overall purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of CHW-delivered selfsample HPV testing (CHW-SS) to increase cervical cancer screening among women in RGV and other low- resource communities in Texas.

The specific aims of this protocol are to:

Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of CHW-SS in the RGV and other low-resource communities in Texas (i.e., reach, screening uptake, notification of test results).

Specific Aim 2: Assess the acceptability and experiences of CHW-SS among under screened persons in rural, persistent poverty communities in the RGV and other low-resource communities in Texas.

Secondary Objectives:

Exploratory Aim 3: Assess attendance for clinical follow-up among individuals who participate in CHW-SS and test positive for HR-HPV.

Exploratory Aim 4: Evaluate contextual fit of the intervention.
