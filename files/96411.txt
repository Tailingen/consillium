Mozobil for Autologous Stem Cell Mobilization
The aim of this study is to evaluate Plerixafor (MOZOBIL) plus recombinant human G-CSF (G-CSF) efficiency in mobilizing sufficient number of stem cells from Lymphoma (NHL and HL) patients for autologous transplantation.

Mobilisation success rate, Mobilisation success rate is defined as the mobilisation of a PBSC graft containing \>2x106 CD34+ cells/kg in ≤ 4 apheresis sessions. We will evaluate the time from chemotherapy to stem cell collection,number of collections required to reach \>2x106 CD34+ cells/kg, number of CD34+ cells collected and percentage of patients reaching \>5x10 CD34+ cells/kg in ≤ 4 apheresis sessions., 4 weeks
engraftment after transplantation, speed of engraftment is determined by the time until recovery of blood counts after transplantation., 100 days
