Evaluate Efficacy of Respiratory Rehabilitation Personalized Mobile Services for Respiratory Diseases
This trial is multicenter prospective study to evaluate clinical efficacy of respiratory rehabilitation personalized mobile services for respiratory disease.

OTHER: Fixed respiratory rehabilitation|OTHER: Responsive respiratory rehabilitation
change from baseline in Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score, The MMRC dyspnea scale is a five-option grading system. The scale measures a person's limitation base on a scale of 0-4 and uses the final value to determine how much disability is caused by shortness of breath., 12 weeks|change from baseline in COPD Assessment Test(CAT) score, The CAT is a validated, short and simple subject completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of subjects with COPD. Subjects are scored on eight items (cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence, sleep and energy) on a scale of 0-5 depending on their impact. The sum of scores for each item gives the subject's impact score ranging from 0 (no impact) to 40 (worst possible impact)., 12 weeks|change from baseline in real distance walked for 6 minutes, 12 weeks
change from baseline in Physical activity, Physical activity will be assessed with the daily walking distance monitored by the application and wearable device., 12 weeks|subject satisfaction with health status, changed from baseline in EQ-5D-5L, 12 weeks|subject satisfaction with service, Assessment tool: Patient's Global Assessment - Subjects are scored on four items (general, easy-to-follow, helpful in exercise and Physical fitness ) on a scale of 1-5 depending on their satisfaction level. The sum of scores for each item will be used for assessement of the subject's satisfaction in the trial., 12 weeks|change in Healthcare resource utilisation(the number of hospitalization) in COPD(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Patients, Comparison with the number of hospitalization during the same period last year, 12 weeks|change in Healthcare resource utilisation(hospitalization period) in COPD(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Patients, Comparison with hospitalization period during the same period last year, 12 weeks|change in Healthcare resource utilisation(the number of visiting emergency room) in COPD(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Patients, Comparison with the number of visiting emergency room during the same period last year, 12 weeks
Patients with Lung Cancer or COPD who need respiratory rehabilitation were enrolled in this trial. The subjets were randomized to 3 group(A: Fixed respiratory rehabilitation program group, B: Mixed respiratory rehabilitation program group(Fixed respiratory rehabilitation for 6 weeks, and then responsive respiratory rehabilitation for 6 weeks) and C: Control group(Ordinary rehabilitation service of the site)).

Patients in Group A\&B were provided with mobile application and wearable O2 saturation machine and mobile application monitors physical activity and provides

1. how to do stretching, weight training with The-ra Band
2. daily and weekly target of exercise
3. alarm algorithms depending on patient's respiratory status(purse rate and O2 saturation)
