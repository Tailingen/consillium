Dual Algorithm Post Market Clinical Study
The purpose of this study is to assess the validity and reproducibility of the MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4 in blood specimens testing repeat reactive (RR) on the first FDA licensed screening assay (Abbott Prism) and non-reactive (NR) on the second FDA licensed screening assay (Avioq ELISA).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4
Assess the HTLV dual algorithm testing in blood donor facilities, HTLV I/II confirmation of specimens testing RR on the first FDA licensed HTLV screening assay and non-reactive (NR) on a second FDA licensed HTLV screening assay., 3 months
This is a prospective study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a dual algorithm testing for HTLV I/II in blood donors. The study hypothesis is that blood donors testing repeat reactive (RR) on the first FDA licensed HTLV screening assay and non-reactive (NR) on a second FDA licensed screening assay will be confirmed as indeterminate or negative on the MP Diagnostics HTLV Blot 2.4.
