The Italian Registry of Malnutrition in Oncology
The aim of the Italian Registry of Malnutrition in Oncology (IRMO) is to set up a digital register of newly diagnosed or treated oncologic patients to monitor their nutritional status, early identify malnutrition and investigate the implications of nutritional support management. In particular, this project aims to establish a prospective cohort of cancer patients in order to investigate the effects of nutritional status and management on overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), and analyse the effects of the nutritional management and support on patients' symptoms and QoL.
Cancer|Cancer Metastatic
OTHER: Cohort observational
Overall survival, Percentage of patients who are alive., 1 year
Progression-free survival, Percentage of patients who are free from tumor progression., 1 year and 2 years|Treatment toxicity, Treatment-related severe adverse event (grade \> or =3) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) and toxicity resulting in any treatment delay or dose reduction., 1 year
This is a multicentric longitudinal observational study on a cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients, candidate for active treatment. In Italy, no reliable data are still available with regards to the actual implementation of adequate nutritional support management in cancer patients; only "real-world" data collected by administrative databases are available in the context of nutrition in oncology, and this somehow limits the possibility to interpret the evidence from a clinical point of view. Hence, the purpose of the intestigators is to collect "real world" clinical data on malnutrition in oncology at the national level, in order to strengthen the evidence and concretely improve nutritional care practices in oncology.
