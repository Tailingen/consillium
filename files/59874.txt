Engineered NK Cells Containing Deleted TGF-BetaR2 and NR3C1 for the Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma
This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of engineered natural killer (NK) cells containing deleted TGF-betaR2 and NR3C1 (cord blood \[CB\]-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1-) in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent). CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- cells are genetically changed immune cells that may help to control the disease.

BIOLOGICAL: Cord Blood-derived Expanded Allogeneic Natural Killer Cells|PROCEDURE: Resection
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Group 1), Will determine maximum tolerated dose and safety of escalating doses of cord blood (CB)-(NK) cells patients with recurrent glioblastoma. A DLT is defined as any grade \>= 3 adverse event assessed as related to CB-NK cells by the investigator (that is, grade \>= 3 adverse drug reaction; grading according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03., Up to 28 days
Overall survival (OS), OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison between or among patients' characteristics groups will be evaluated by log-rank test. Cox regression models will be applied to assess the effect of covariates of interest on OS., From definitive histological diagnosis until the time of death, assessed up to 90 days post-treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction (partial response and complete response, per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology \[RANO\] criteria). Will be calculated as the ratio of number of patients with response over number of patients treated, and 95% confidence interval of ORR will be estimated., Up to 90 days post-treatment|Duration of response (DOR), From the time of initial response until documented tumor progression per RANO criteria, assessed up to 90 days|Time to progression (TTP), TTP will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison between or among patients' characteristics groups will be evaluated by log-rank test. Cox regression models will be applied to assess the effect of covariates of interest on TTP., From the date of start of treatment until the tumor progression as defined by RANO, assessed up to 90 days post-treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison between or among patients' characteristics groups will be evaluated by log-rank test. Cox regression models will be applied to assess the effect of covariates of interest on PFS. The point estimate of median PFS and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) will be estimated., From the start of treatment until the time of first disease progression or relapse (as defined by RANO criteria), or death due to disease, assessed up to 6 months post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral injection of escalating doses of allogeneic CB-NK-TGF-£\]R2-/NR3C1- in patients with recurrent grade 4 astrocytoma,
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Group 1) of CB-NK-TGF-£\]R2-/NR3C1- administered via IT injection in patients with recurrent grade 4 astrocytoma
* To evaluate the immunological phenotype and anti-tumor function of NK cells in resected tumor tissue after treatment with CB-NK-TGF-âR2-/NR3C1- in the surgical expansion group (Group 2). Persistency of the NK cells in the tissue will be assessed by flow cytometry. Tissue cells will be stained with anti human CD45, anti human CD56 and anti HLA molecule expressed by the cord blood donor infused in the patient. NK cells from the tissue may be isolated using magnetic bead selection (anti-HLA specific from cord blood donor labeled with PE and them use a anti PE magnetics bead selection). Those NK cells would be used to perform a chromium release assay (killing assay) to test the ability of the NK in killing K562 and GSC targets. If the NK cells obtained from the tissue are too low to do killing assay, the NK cells could be expanded for one week using UAPC and IL2 to get more NK cells for assays.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

-To determine response as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO), duration of clinical response, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS)ƒn

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

-Monitoring immune responses following CB-NK-TGF-£\]R2-/NR3C1- dosing, in vivo persistence and expansion of CB-NK-TGF-£\]R2-/NR3C1- during treatment, characterization of immune cell subpopulations in the peripheral blood, serum analysis of immune correlates, alloreactivity characterization, and anti-HLA antibody analysis, and CB-NK-TGF-£\]R2-/NR3C1- trafficking in tumor microenvironments in the surgical expansion cohort. Tumor tissue from surgical resection will be further analyzed for immune infiltrates, fibrosis, and tumor microenvironment.
