Study of Tislelizumab, Pamiparib, and Other Investigational Agents in Participants With Advanced Malignancies
This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of BeiGene investigational drugs in participants with advanced malignancies who participated in a prior BeiGene-sponsored clinical study (parent study).
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Pamiparib|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Sitravatinib|DRUG: Ociperlimab|DRUG: BAT1706|DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: BGB-15025|DRUG: Zanidatamab|DRUG: BGB-A445|DRUG: Surzebiclimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: LBL-007
Number of Participants with Immune-Mediated Adverse Events, Safety as assessed by the number of participants with immune-mediated adverse events related to immunotherapy as assessed by the investigator, \> Grade 3 adverse events, Grade 2 adverse events that affect key organs (eg, heart, liver, brain, lung, kidney, eye), nonserious adverse events that lead to dose modification or drug discontinuation or withdrawal from the trial, and serious adverse events., up to 7 years
Overall survival, Overall survival defined as the time from start of treatment in the parent study (or randomization date for a randomized parent study) until the date of death from any cause., up to 7 years
For the purposes of this study, "study treatment" will refer to all investigational agents. A parent study is defined as the original BeiGene-sponsored clinical trial in which the participant was initially enrolled and received BeiGene investigational drugs (with or without other treatments).
