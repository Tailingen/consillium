Explore the Clinical Value of 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms
68Ga-DOTANOC and 18F-FDG PET/CT have important values in the staging and clinical treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. Retrospective studies suggest that the positivite rates and SUVmax of dual imaging associated with pathological findings and prognosis. The study was designed to confirm thet clinical values of dual imagings for neuroendocrine tumors.
