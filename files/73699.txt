A Study to Assess the Efficacy of WSD0922-FU in Patients with C797S+ Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, Open Label, Multicenter, Single Arm Study of WSD0922-FU for Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with First-Line Osimertinib Treatment and whose Tumors harbor a C797S mutation within the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

WSD0922-FU is a potent reversible inhibitor of both the single EGFRm+ (TKI sensitivity conferring mutation) and dual EGFRm+/C797S+ (third-generation TKI as first-line resistance conferring mutation) receptor forms of EGFR with selectivity margin over wild-type EGFR. Therefore WSD0922-FU has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with advanced NSCLC harboring both the single sensitivity mutations and the resistance mutation following first-line therapy with a third-generation EGFR TKI (e.g., Osimertinib). The clinical development program with WSD0922-FU will assess the safety and efficacy of WSD0922-FU in patients with advanced NSCLC whose cancers have progressed with or without brain metastasis following a first-line Osimertinib treatment.
