Extended Access of Momelotinib in Adults With Myelofibrosis
The primary objective of this study is to provide extended access and assess long-term safety of momelotinib (MMB) in participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-PV/ET MF) enrolled in studies GS-US-352-0101 (NCT01969838), GS-US-352-1214 (NCT02101268), GS-US-352-1154 (NCT02124746), SRA-MMB-301 who are currently receiving treatment with MMB (available as 50mg,100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg tablets) and have not experienced progression of disease. The secondary objective is to assess overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) in all subjects.
