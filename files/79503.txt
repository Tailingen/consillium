Phase I Trial of Afatinib (BIBW 2992) and Dasatinib in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to:

* Find out if the study drugs Afatinib and Dasatinib can be safely given together to patients with lung cancer
* Learn how these two drugs work in cancer cells when they are combined
* Learn more about the side effects of these two drugs when combined
* Find the highest doses of the study drugs Afatinib and Dasatinib that can be given safely without causing serious side effects
Lung Cancer|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Dasatinib - 1A|DRUG: Afatinib - 1A|DRUG: Dasatinib - 1B|DRUG: Afatinib - 1B
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Afatinib (BIBW 2992) in Combination With Dasatinib, The MTD for this combined treatment will be defined as either:

1. The highest dosage cohort in which six patients had been treated and there were less than two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or,
2. Afatinib at the highest tolerated dose investigated (40 mg by mouth \[PO\] daily) plus dasatinib at the highest tolerated dose investigated (cohort 3, 140 mg PO daily)., Up to 6 Months
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Estimates objective response rate (complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]) in participants with acquired EGFR resistance, Up to 6 Months|Median Progression Free Survival, Estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate in participants with acquired EGFR resistance. Response Criteria for Phase 1B will follow RECIST v.1.1: Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 6 Months
