Impact of Tamsulosin on Voiding Patterns Following Early Catheter Removal After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy
To date, there is a lack of consensus concerning the optimal timing for removal of the urethral catheter, its related complications, the effectiveness in prophylactic drug use to reduce complication, and the patient reported outcomes (quality of life) after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of tamsulosin on voiding patterns following early urethral catheter removal after RALP for prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms, Prostatectomy
DRUG: tamsulosin 0.4mg|OTHER: No medication
The incidence of acute urinary retention, within the 30 days after surgery
Patient reported outcomes, 20 days after surgery (plus or minus 3 days)
