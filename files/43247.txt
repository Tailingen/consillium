Dose Escalation Study of Minnelide in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study is to determine the safety and recommended dosing of Minnelide in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Minnelide
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Minnelide, MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses up to 1.25 mg daily. MTD reflects highest dose of drug that did not cause a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)., Up to 28 days for each dosing cohort|Number of Participants Who Experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is any Grade 3 or 4 drug-related non-hematologic toxicity, with some exceptions per protocol., Up to 28 days for each dosing cohort
Complete Response (CR), Participants who experience Complete Response (CR) and Complete Response with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi) rate as defined by 2003 International Working Group (IWG) for AML., Up to 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate is defined as CR + CRi + partial response (PR) as defined by 2003 IWG criteria for AML., Up to 12 months|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as time interval between achievement of CR to time of relapse., Up to 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as time interval from time of enrollment onto the clinical trial to death from any cause., Up to 12 months
This phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Minnelide as single-agent in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. The oral formulation of Minnelide will be used. Minnelide is a prodrug of triptolide (a potent heat shock protein (HSP) 70 inhibitor) with promising preclinical activity in AML.
