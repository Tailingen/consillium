Phase II Nivolumab and Ramucirumab for Patients With Previously-Treated Mesothelioma
This study will evaluate the combination of Nivolumab and Ramucirumab in patients with previously-treated mesothelioma.
Mesothelioma, Malignant
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ramucirumab
Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. Response rate will be defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1., Up to a maximum of 23 months
Adverse Event Assessment, The frequency and severity of all grade â‰¥ 2 treatment related adverse events are reported by CTCAE v4 term., AE had been recorded from time of consent until 100 days after discontinuation of study drug or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first; up to a maximum of 28 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. PFS is defined as time from treatment start until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death, up to a maximum of 23 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as time of treatment start until death or date of last contact., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 32 months.
The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) \[16\] and VEGFR2 \[34\] are highly-expressed on mesothelioma cells, and are therefore attractive options for this cancer. We chose to study the combination of ramucirumab with nivolumab because of the potential efficacy of these two agents in mesothelioma and because of the potential synergistic activity between them \[30\]. As previously discussed, immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 inhibitors must contend with a hostile, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment due to angiogenesis that results in hypoxia. This hypoxia decreases the ability of antibodies to infiltrate the tumor. We hypothesize that the normalization of tumor vasculature (by reducing the area of the tumor that is hypoxic) with an anti-VEGF strategy (i.e., ramucirumab) used in synergy with a PD-1 inhibitor will facilitate the infiltration of T-lymphocytes into tumor parenchyma. We will conduct a phase II study based on this premise using nivolumab and ramucirumab as second-line therapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma who have failed standard doublet platinum and anti-folate therapy.
