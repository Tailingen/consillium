A Phase I Study Investigating the Combination of the Ziftomenib, Venetoclax and Azacitidine in Pediatric Relapsed and Refractory Acute Leukemias
To find the highest safe dose of ziftomenib that can be combined with venetoclax and azacitidine in pediatric participants with acute leukemia that has certain types of genetic mutations (changes).
Refractory Acute Leukemia|Pediatric Relapsed
DRUG: Ziftomenib|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives - To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of ziftomenib in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for pediatric participants with acute leukemias with KMT2A-r, NPM1-m or NUP98-r.

Secondary Objectives

- To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by overall response (OR), including complete remission (CR), CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS) and partial remission (PR), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR) of pediatric participants treated with this combination.

Exploratory Objective

* To evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance.
* To investigate relationships between PK/exposure and clinical outcomes (e.g.,safety/tolerability, efficacy).
