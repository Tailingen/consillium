Docetaxel and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Cancer of the Larynx or Hypopharynx
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving docetaxel together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Objective response of primary tumor
Local complete response rate|Local progression-free survival at 2 years|Local relapse-free survival|Larynx preservation survival at 2 years|Overall survival at 2 years|Treatment completion rate|Incidence of adverse effects
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the objective response of the primary tumor in patients with stage II or III squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx treated with docetaxel and radiotherapy.

Secondary

* Determine the local relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the larynx-preservation survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the protocol completion rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
