Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma-Recurrent|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma-Refractory
DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Chidamide
complete response rate (CR), To assess the complete response rate (CR) at the end of treatment with Glofitamab combination with chidamide., up to the end of 12 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment of Glofitamab combination with chidamide., up to the end of 12 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)|Duration of Response (DoR), The length of time between the achievement of criteria for response to treatment (first documented complete or partial response) and the first documented relapse or progression., up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the enrollment of a subject to the occurrence of (in any way) progression of disease or Death for any reason. patients with indeterminate recurrence or Death at the last follow-up, defined as the date of the last Investigation, up to 2 years|OS, The time from subject enrollment to Death caused by any reason. for patients lost to follow-up, the time of the last follow-up; for patients still alive at the end of study, the date of the end of follow-up., up to 2 years
To identify biomarkers, To identify biomarkers that may predict response to a combination regimen, biomarkers associated with progression to a more severe disease state, biomarkers that are sensitive to the development of Adverse event, biomarkers that provide evidence of the activity of the combination, or biomarkers that may enhance the understanding or understanding of the biology of the disease., up to 2 years
This is an open-label, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of Glofitamab Combination with chidamide in the patient â‰¥ 18 years of age with recurrent/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive combination therapy of Glofitamab, chidamide. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up.
