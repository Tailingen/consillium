Pilot Study of Bisphosphonates for Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to mechanistically define the potential anticancer activities of the osteoporosis bisphosphonate (BP) drug alendronate, and extend the analysis to learn novel information about the impact of BP on gamma delta (γδ) T cells in breast tissues as well as epithelial breast cell differentiation of high-risk women. To this end, we have designed a BP "window trial" to examine the effect of 1 - 3 weeks administration of alendronate on women at high-risk for breast cancer, at the level of immunosurveillance and mammary epithelial cell differentiation.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Alendronate
Percentage change of γδ T cell in CNB, γδ T cell infiltration and activation as defined by the presence and increase in percentage of γδ T cells in the CNB sample following study agent (alendronate) administration. The effect of alendronate will be assessed using a one-tailed one-sample paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level of 0.10., 1-3 weeks
Percentage change of mammary epithelial basal cells in the CNB samples after alendronate administration, The effect of alendronate will be assessed using a one-tailed one-sample paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level of 0.10., 1-3 weeks|Percentage change of mammary luminal cells in the CNB samples after alendronate administration, The effect of alendronate will be assessed using a one-tailed one-sample paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level of 0.10., 1-3 weeks
Percentage change of γδ T cells in the blood, The effect of alendronate will be assessed using a one-tailed one-sample paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level of 0.10., 1-3 weeks|Ratio of percent of luminal cells to percent of basal cells in CNB, The effect of alendronate will be assessed using a one-tailed one-sample paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test at a significance level of 0.10., 1-3 weeks
