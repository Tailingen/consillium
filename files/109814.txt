Comparing CGM and OGTT in Relation to Iron Overload Detected by Pancreas T2* MRI in High-Risk Hematology Group
A prospective, observational, comparative study with no intervention.The objective of the study to compare the efficiency of detecting glycemic abnormalities using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMs) versus Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and HbA1C (Glycated Hemoglobin) and their relation to iron overload detected by T2\* MRI of the pancreas in high-risk patients due to insulin deficiency (potential beta cell injury) and those with insulin resistance and to study the different factors that may affect the glycemic control in these patients in relation to their results like the Dose of corticosteroids and chemotherapy in ALL and Hemoglobinopathies, Liver function in ALL and Hemoglobinopathies, and Serum ferritin in Hemoglobinopathies and their transfusion status. Using Validated Tools with Permission, the participants will be selected through probability (random) sampling method with expected subjects numbers ALL/L: 30-50, Thalassemia Major: 20, Sickle cell disease: 20.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: T2* MRI of the Pancreas
Efficiency of continuous glucose monitoring compared to oral glucose tolerance and MRI of the Pancreas, Compare the efficiency of detecting glycemic abnormalities using CGMS versus OGTT vs HbA1C. in high-risk patients due to insulin deficiency (potential beta cell injury) and those with insulin resistance. Detect the prevalence of glycemic abnormalities detected in the same group of patients (high-risk patients) using three different modalities of testing (CGMS, OGTT, HbA1C)and T2\*MRI for pancreas, 12 Months
