A Trial Comparing Two Modalities of Prophylactic Nutritional Support During Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer
Purpose:

To compare the effect of prophylactic enteral feeding tube placement (either percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or nasogastric (NG) tube) in patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) on nutritional status, quality of life, mental and emotional health, rates of clinical complications, and cost of care.

Study Design:

Prospective randomized controlled trial with 2 arms and equal allocation ratio

Study Objectives:

1. The primary objective is to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing chemo-radiation at SKMCH\&RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end of 24 weeks after treatment initiation.
2. The secondary objectives are to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing chemo-radiation at SKMCH\&RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end of 12 weeks; the rates of complications; quality of life including symptoms of depression and anxiety; and cost of care (all related to enteral feeding tube placement only) at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks and 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

Patients and methods:

Eligible patients will be enrolled consecutively from the gastroenterology outpatient clinics at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH\&RC), Lahore and randomly assigned to receive either PEG tube or NG tube placement prior to commencement of treatment. Patients will receive counseling from a trained nutritionist regarding adequate nutrition during treatment and enteral feeding tube care. Detailed information regarding demographics, cancer location, type and staging, clinical status, nutritional status, quality of life, mental and emotional health, and cost of care will be obtained at baseline (time at which cancer treatment is initiated) and on 21st day (3 weeks), 42nd day (6 weeks), 84th day (12 weeks) and 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation. The primary endpoint will be to compare the nutritional status between the two treatment groups on an intent-to-treat basis on 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement|PROCEDURE: nasogastric tube placement
Nutritional Status, Nutritional status will be assessed using three methods: (1) Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool, (2) anthropometric data, and (3) biochemical data. Biochemical assessment will be done by measuring serum albumin and electrolytes and kidney function tests. Primary outcome will be analyzed at aggregate level and after stratifying by age, sex, location of tumor, disease severity, and grade of dysphagia., change from baseline nutritional status at 24 weeks after starting treatment
Quality of Life + Mental/Emotional health, The quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) version 3.0. and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT H\&N) version 4. Patients will also be assessed for their mental and emotional health. For this purpose, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used. All of these questionnaires are available in Urdu., change from baseline quality of life & mental/emotional health scores at 12 and 24 weeks|Cost of care, Data on cost of care associated with nutritional support will be assessed from the hospital's and patient's perspective., up to 24 weeks|Clinical Complications, Rate of minor and major clinical complications related to placement of PEG or NG tube will be assessed, up to 24 weeks|Nutritional status, Nutritional status will be assessed using three methods: (1) Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool, (2) anthropometric data, and (3) biochemical data. Biochemical assessment will be done by measuring serum albumin and electrolytes and kidney function tests. All secondary outcomes will be analyzed at aggregate level and after stratifying by age, sex, location of tumor, disease severity, and grade of dysphagia., change in nutritional status from baseline at 12 weeks after starting treatment
