The primary purpose of the study is to quantify participants' demographic parameters, country standard therapies, treatment patterns and outcomes among participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in oncology concentration hospitals in Latin America.

Number of Participants with Previous Comorbidities, Comorbidities included: heart, diabetes, hypertension, renal, infections, other neoplasia, neurologic, rheumatologic, HIV, thrombosis, bone and other., 1 year|Number of Participants as per treatment therapy received, Cancer treatment (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia \[CLL\], Multiple Myeloma \[MM\] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma \[NHL\]) for all participants is summarized by the number of participants who had any type of surgery or radiotherapy (external radiation or brachytherapy) or other drug treatments., 1 year|Overall survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of starting treatment to death due to any cause., 1 year|Number of Participants with Response to Treatment, Number of participants who responded to treatment is presented. Treatment response will be assessed based on complete response or partial response., 1 year
Incidence Percentage of Participants with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Incidence of CLL, MM and NHL will be reported. It is a percentage of the population at risk of developing the disease., 1 year|Prevalence Percentage of Participants with CLL, MM and NHL, Prevalence of CLL, MM and NHL will be reported. Prevalence will be estimated using available population demographic information as the denominators and using the percentage of registered participants with those cancers at the sites as the numerators., 1 year
This is a retrospective (take a look back at events that already have taken place), non-interventional, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to review medical records of adult participants with a diagnosis of CLL, MM or NHL anytime since 01 January 2006. Only data available from clinical practice will be collected. All eligible participants at participating centers will be included regardless of participant's demographics, prior or current treatments for disease, or clinical outcome. The period of observation will span from 01 January 2006 through present, but all eligible participants must be followed for a minimum of 1 year, unless the participant died within that first year. Participant demographic parameters, standard therapies, treatment patterns and outcomes will be primarily quantified.
