Analysis of CMTM6 Expression in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
In this study, we aim to investigate the expression of CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 6 (CMTM6) in leukemia cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We will use peripheral blood samples and assess CMTM6 expression by flow cytometry and Western Blot.
