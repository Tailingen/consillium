Influence of Intraoperative Blood Salvage and Autotransfusion on Tumor Recurrence After Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation
The practice of intraoperative blood salvage and autotransfusion (IBSA) during deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can potentially reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion. However, implementing IBSA remains debatable due to concerns about its possible detrimental effects on oncologic recurrence. Hence, a nationwide multi-center study was conducted to investigate further the association between IBSA and post-transplant HCC recurrence, including a stratified subgroup analysis.
