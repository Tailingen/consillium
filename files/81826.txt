Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Ascending Doses of Simotinib Hydrochloride in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Simotinib Hydrochloride in NSCLC patients. The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity.
