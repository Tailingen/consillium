Prospective Research Assessment in Multiple Myeloma: An Observational Evaluation (PREAMBLE)
The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of all approved multiple myeloma (MM) therapies in the newly-diagnosed (NDMM) and the relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) settings in real-world clinical practice.
