HFSRT With Concurrent TMZ for Large BMs
A multi-center randomized phase III trial was conducted to investigate the feasibility and safety of adding temozolomide to hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large brain metastases.
Brain Metastases|Chemotherapy|Radiotherapy
DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: hypofractionated radiotherapy
intracranial progression free survival (IPFS) rate, IPFS was defined as the interval from the beginning of radiation to any intracranial progression, up to 2 years
local control rate, the control rate of treated lesions, up to 2 years|Brain metastasis-specific survival (BMSS) rate, BMSS was defined as the internal from the beginning of RT to death caused by BM, up to 2 years|overall survival (OS) rate, OS was defined as the internal from the beginning of RT to death caused by any reason, up to 2 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 and NRG/RTOG CNS toxicities criteria, the toxicities caused by RT and (or) Chemotherapy, acute toxicities: up to 3 months after RT; Late toxicities: up to 2 years after RT
A previous single arm phase II trial and propensity- matched study of our institution have shown that HFSRT combined with concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of â‰¥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year local control, intracranial progression free survival, progression free survival and overall survival rates were better than HFSRT alone group. Thus, the investigator conducted this randomized phase III trial to broad the sample size and verify our previous results. To finish the study in time, the investigator designed a multi-center trial.
