Novel Method to Assess Hepatic Regeneration and Predict Hepatic Related Morbidity After Partial Hepatectomy
the investigators will pursue two specific aims: (1) to monitor the extent of heme oxygenase induction (by measuring endogenous CO production) in relationship to the extent of hepatic resection (2) to assess the production of CO in patients following liver resection and correlate these findings to the rate of liver regeneration and liver function.

OTHER: carbon monoxide measurement via smokerlyzer
correlation of carbon monoxide levels in exhaled breath with quantity and quality of liver regeneration, patients will be asked to donate exhaled breath into a smokerlyzer device, measurements will be taken pre, then 4 hours and 24 hours post resection
level of carbon monoxide in exhaled air of patients, patients will be asked to donate exhaled breath into a smokerlyzer device, measurements will be taken pre, then 4 hours and 24 hours post resection|quantity of liver regeneration, liver volume (ml), CT liver volumetric studies, one and three months after resection|quality of hepatic regeneration, normalized liver function, serum protein, albumin, AST and ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin level, one and three months post resection
