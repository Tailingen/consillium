the SXRN transcripts,its targets, and possible regulated targets, Explore the expression changes of the following indicators:the SXRN transcripts 1-RNA, Its targets -miR-214, possible regulated targets-A2AR, INSL3, and Inflammatory Biomarkers, 12 months
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of SXRN Plasmid DNA Technique in patients with advanced solid tumors. Three dose levels are initially formulated, namely 2mg, 4mg, and 10mg of SXRN, adopting an accelerated titration followed by the traditional "3+3" design. SXRN will be administered daily x 5 with 2 days off (total of 21 days) for 3 weeks followed by a no-treatment observation period.
