GP Combined with Toripalimab Versus GP Induction Chemotherapy for Advanced Childhood Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a low incidence rate in children, accounting for only 1-2% of pediatric tumors. However, it is prone to metastasis, and most patients are already in advanced stages at the time of diagnosis. Chemoradiotherapy has been shown to effectively improve prognosis. Induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with adjusted radiation doses has demonstrated good efficacy in children and adolescents with locally advanced NPC. Nevertheless, 10-15% of patients still experience treatment failure, and 15-20% of patients respond poorly to induction chemotherapy, necessitating higher doses of radiation, which in turn increases the incidence of treatment-related sequelae. Therefore, it is crucial to explore further treatment strategies that can enhance response rates, reduce acute and long-term treatment toxicities, and improve overall efficacy on the basis of induction chemotherapy followed by adjusted concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP regimen) has been identified as the highest level of evidence-based induction chemotherapy regimen (Class 1A). However, the complete response rate of only 10% after three cycles of GP regimen induction chemotherapy in adults with locoregionally advanced NPC indicates the need for intensified induction treatment. PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have demonstrated synergistic tumor-killing effects, providing additional curative opportunities for patients with locally advanced disease. Toripalimab, with its dual-blocking mechanism, is an ideal PD-1 monoclonal antibody model that can fully relieve T-cell-mediated antitumor immune suppression. Previous clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

This study aims to conduct the first single-center, phase II randomized controlled clinical trial in children and adolescents with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, comparing the GP regimen combined with toripalimab induction chemotherapy versus the GP regimen alone. The goal is to optimize the treatment model for pediatric and adolescent NPC, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and provide high-level evidence-based medical support for the international treatment guidelines for pediatric NPC.

Complete Response (CR) Rate After Induction Chemotherapy, CR is assessed after induction chemotherapy by independent reviewers, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Complete response defined as the complete disappearance of the target and non-target lesion(s) identified at baseline after radiological evaluation by enhanced MRI (or enhanced CT if indicated)., when the induction chemotherapy complete
Overall survival, defined as the time from random assignment to death from any cause or censored at the date of last follow-up., 3 years|Progression-free survival, defined as the time from random assignment to documented local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, 3 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS), defined as the time from random assignment to local or regional relapse, or death from any cause., 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), defined as the time from random assignment to distant metastasis, or death from any cause, 3 years|Incidence of acute and late toxicity, Incidence of acute toxicity is evaluated on basis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 criteria. Late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme. Acute adverse events, occurring during study treatment, and radiation-related late adverse events, occurring from 3 months after completion of radiotherapy, and chemotherapy-induced late adverse events, occurring from 3 months after completion of chemotherapy until end of follow up., 3 years|Hormone levels, Changes in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (GH), will be monitored., 3 years|Growth condition of Height, Patients will be monitored for height (in metres) before treatment, after treatment, and during follow-up., 3 years|Growth condition of Weight, Patients will be monitored for Weight(in kilograms) before treatment, after treatment, and during follow-up., 3 years|Growth condition of BMI, Patients will be monitored for BMI (in kg/mÂ²) before treatment, after treatment, and during follow-up., 3 years|Quality of life, The quality of life will be evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30, Version 3.0) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H and N35, Version 1.0). For the EORTC QLQ-C30, scores range from 0 to 100. In the Functioning and General Health domains, higher scores reflect better functional status and quality of life, while in the Symptoms domain, higher scores indicate more symptoms or problems, signifying poorer quality of life. For the QLQ-H and N35, scores also range from 0 to 100, with higher scores consistently indicating poorer quality of life. We will calculate the scores for patients in each domain according to the scoring criteria of the respective questionnaires and explore the correlation of these scores with treatment plans, etc. Each domain and questionnaire will be treated as a separate outcome measure., 3 years
