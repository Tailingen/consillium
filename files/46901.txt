Adujvant CT+CRT vs Adujvant CT After D2 Resection for Locally Advanced Proximal Gastric Adenocarcinoma
This study evaluates the addition of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced proximal gastric adenocarcinoma after standard D2 radical resection.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|DRUG: Adjuvant Chemotherapy
disease-free survival, after primary treatment the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of cancer., 3 year
Because of its special anatomical structure, local recurrence rate of locally advanced proximal gastric adenocarcinoma is still high after radical operation.

As a local/regional therapy, radiotherapy combined with concurrent chemotherapy can kill local residual tumor cells and reduce the risk of local and regional recurrence.
