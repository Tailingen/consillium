Clinical Study of the Hyperviscosity Syndrome in Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
Walsdenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is defined by a bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) in blood. Clinical manifestations of the hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) are related to the large amount of IgM in circulating blood or to some physicochemical characteristics such as the presence of a cryoglobulin property. Although HVS is one of the most frequent criteria for initiating therapy in WM, few studies focused on its description and no diagnostic criteria are available.

The present study aims to identify a diagnostic system for HVS, taking into account objective symptoms such as bleedings, fundoscopic findings and also subjective symptoms such as fatigue and comorbidities that may influence the severity of symptoms.
