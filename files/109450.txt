A Study of CAR-GPRC5D in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Plasma Cell Leukemia
This study is a single-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to observe the safety and efficacy of different doses of CAR-GPRC5D in patients with R/R MM or Plasma Cell Leukemia.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Plasma Cell Leukemia
DRUG: CAR-GPRC5D
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) by dose group, Dose limiting toxicity will be assessed after infusion in each dose group, 28 days after CAR-T cell infusion|Type and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) by dose group, Calculate type and incidence of adverse events (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), including those happened after lymphodepletion and after infusion, those related to study drug and lymphodepletion, or those that led to withdrawal from the study. They will also be aggregated by systematic organ classification (SOC), preferred term (PT), and severity, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of participants who achieved PR or better response., 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), OS is measured from the date of the initial infusion of CAR-GPRC5D to the date of the participant's death, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Duration of response (DOR) after administration, DOR will be calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of the initial infusion of CAR-GPRC5D of participants to the first time of disease progression or death for any reason, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Time to response (TTR), The time interval between the first treatment of CAR-GPRC5D and the time of first recording of sCR or CR or VGPR or PR of the participants, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Time to complete Response (TTCR), Time from CAR-GPRC5D infusion to first documentation of complete response of the participants, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Percentage of Participants With Negative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), MRD negative rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve MRD negative status by the respective time point, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, The maximum transgene level at Tmax, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax, Time to peak transgene level, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-28days, Area under the curve of CAR-T cells from time zero to Day 28, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-90days, Area under the curve of CAR T cells from time zero to Day 90, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|PD endpoints - the level of free CAR-GPRC5D, The content of free CAR-GPRC5D in peripheral blood will be detected at each time point, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|PD endpoints - the levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines, The concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines (such as IL-6) will be detected at each time point, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Health-related quality of life assessment, HRQoL will be assessed by the European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Evaluation of lymphocyte subsets, Lymphocyte subsets will be assessed by FACS, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Levels of immunoglobulins, Immunoglobulins in peripheral blood will be assessed to monitor changes, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion
Positive rate of human anti-CAR antibody, The levels of human anti-CAR antibody of participants will be detected, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion|Number of Participants with replication competent lentivirus (RCL), Number of participants exhibiting anti-drug antibodies for CAR-GPRC5D will be reported, 2 years after CAR-T cell infusion
Apheresis will be performed to manufacture CAR-GPRC5D CAR-T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between apheresis and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. Then, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of CAR-GPRC5D at 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 x 10\^6 CAR-T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of 2 years after infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be followed for up to 15 years after infusion.
