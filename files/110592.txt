Postoperative Thrombosis Prevention in Patients With CD
Patients with Cushing disease was randomized to 2 groups. After surgery, the patients were managed with mechanical prevention or mechanical prevention plus anticoagulant drugs(LMWH followed by rivaroxaban), VTE was observed 24h, 5day, 4weeks and 12weeks after surgery.Bleeding events were also recorded.

Cushing disease, caused by ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, can lead to serious complications with increased mortality. Minimally invasive surgery is currently the preferred treatment for the disease, allowing more than 80% of tumors to be completely removed. However, postoperative venous thrombosis (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) pose great threats to patients' safety. According to the literatures and the data from our center, up to 27% of the patients with Cushing's disease developed VTE after surgery. Due to the lacking of a randomized prospective study, there is no consensus or guideline on preventative anticoagulation protocols for postoperative management in patients with Cushing's disease. This is a prospective randomized control study on preventative anticoagulation in patients with Cushing's disease after transsphenoidal resection.
