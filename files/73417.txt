Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of Erythrocyte-αPD-1 Conjugate in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of Erythrocyte-αPD-1 conjugates in patients with advanced malignancies
Cancer|Solid Tumor|Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: Engineered erythrocytes (or red blood cells) covalently conjugated with commercially available anti-PD-1 antibodies on their membranes
Incidence of adverse events, The incidence of adverse events (AE), treatment related adverse events (TRAE), and severe adverse events (SAE) during the treatment of engineered erythrocytes, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pharmacodynamics characteristics Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax), The occupancy rate of PD-1 receptor on the surface of peripheral blood T cells in subjects after infusion,including Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax), through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacodynamics characteristics Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve（AUC）, The occupancy rate of PD-1 receptor on the surface of peripheral blood T cells in subjects after infusion,including Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Efficacy of Erythrocyte-αPD-1 Conjugate, According to RECIST 1.1, the effectiveness of Erythrocyte-αPD-1 Conjugate injection in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced solid tumors was evaluated. The evaluation indicators included objective response rate (ORR),etc., per 6 weeks
Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Describe the number of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) produced by subjects at each time point after treatment., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Peripheral immune response assessment, Immune cell alterations(number of T-cell,etc) in the peripheral are analyzed by flow cytometry., through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of Erythrocyte-αPD-1 conjugates in patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced malignancies who have failed previous systemic therapy.

The study was divided into two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion
