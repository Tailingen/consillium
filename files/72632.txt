Reconstruction of Maxillary and Midfacial Defects Using Latissimus Dorsi Scapular Free Flaps
Bony reconstruction of the midface with free tissue transfer is complex and challenging due to structural considerations such as the need for orbital support, patency of the nasal cavity, restoration of the palate and alveolus and skull base support when needed. As a result, bony reconstruction is important especially for patients who experience diplopia, hypoglobus and enophthalmos postoperatively.

Orocutaneous and nasocutaneous fistulae and infection due to communication with the oral cavity or sinuses are also common complication . Finally, cosmetic deformities from inadequate projection are also a concern.

Cosmetic and functional outcomes are improved with bony reconstruction as it is able to provide rigid support of key structures, restoration of contour, affords the possibility of dental rehabilitation and is less likely to contract significantly following radiation treatment.

Subscapular system free flaps (SF) are uniquely suited to address the needs of midface reconstruction. A substantial amount of bone can be harvested from the lateral scapular border and scapular tip, each with different shapes and thicknesses. Chimeric flaps can be harvested in various combinations, adding Para scapular and scapular skin paddles, latissimus muscle (with or without skin), serratus muscle and rib. Additionally, due to the vascular organization of this network, these components can be harvested off separate pedicles, offering great flexibility and freedom of movement relative to each other .
