Objective response rate, The percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator based on the RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months after study start.
Progression-free survival, From randomization to the time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 36 months after study start|Duration of disease remission, For subjects whose best response is CR or PR , it is defined as from the date when tumor response is first recorded to the date when disease progression is first recorded or the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months after study start|Disease control rate, Percentage of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease(SD) at 6 weeks or more as determined by RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months after study start|Clinical benefit rate, The percentage of subjects achieving CR, PR or SD as assessed by the investigator based on the RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months after study start|Overall survival, From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Up to 48 months after study start|Incidence of adverse events, All adverse medical events (e.g. adverse events, serious adverse event and abnormal laboratory values) that occurred after the subject received the investigational drug., Up to 36 months after study start|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Incidence of ADA, 1 hour Before infusion on Cycle 1 Day1, Cycle 2 Day1, Cycle 4 Day1, Cycle 7 Day1, Cycle 12 Day1, and 30 days after the end of the last infusion.
