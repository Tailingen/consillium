Hyperpolarized Carbon C 13 Pyruvate Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging works in predicting treatment response in patients with prostate cancer. Hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging may help to accurately predict how prostate cancer patients will respond to standard therapy (abiraterone and apalutamide).

Reproducibility of the key performance indicator, Up to 3 years
Sensitivity assessed by comparison to biopsy, The location of signal by hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate will be compared to location of tumor at biopsy or if available, follow-up surgical pathology in patients who did not receive interval additional prostate directed therapy, such as hormonal or radiation therapy., Up to 3 years|Specificity assessed by comparison to biopsy, The location of signal by hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate will be compared to location of tumor at biopsy or if available, follow-up surgical pathology in patients who did not receive interval additional prostate directed therapy, such as hormonal or radiation therapy., Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess reproducibility of quantitative spectroscopic and imaging parameters in hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), including key performance indicator (kpl), which assesses the rate of conversion of 13-C pyruvate to 13-C lactate in the tissue of interest, using a test-retest study design.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To provide initial assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate MRSI performed pre-therapy for detecting high risk localized prostate cancer.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds and undergo MRSI over 2-3 minutes at 6 and 8 weeks.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 day and then for up to 3 years.
