Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors
This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of combination chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
Recurrent Prostate Cancer|Stage IV Prostate Cancer|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: tanespimycin|DRUG: docetaxel
Maximum tolerated dose determined by dose-limiting toxicities assessed using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2.0, 28 days
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) administered with docetaxel in patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer or other progressive metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

Group 1: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and 17-AAG IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Group 2: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and 17-AAG as in group 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients per group receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 20 additional patients (10 per group) are treated at the MTD.

Patients are followed every 2-3 months.
