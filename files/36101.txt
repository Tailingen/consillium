A Study of AK146D1 for Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an first-in-human, Phase I clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor efficacy of AK146D1 for injection in advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AK146D1 for injection
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug., During the first 3 weeks of treatment.|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), AEs refer to any untoward medical occurrence or deterioration of existing medical events after the participants sign the ICFs, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after the last dose of study drug
Serum PK concentration of AK146D1, Serum PK concentration of AK146D1 in participants after administration, From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1|Anti-drug antibodies (ADA), The number and percentage of participants with detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA), From pre-dose to 90 days post end of treatment|Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, ORR is the proportion of participants with complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) , assessed based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) assessed per RECIST v1.1, DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with CR, PR, or SD, assessed based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DoR) assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST Version 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Time to response (TTR) assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, TTR is defined as the time to objective response based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression (based on RECIST Version 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
