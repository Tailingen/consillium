FDG-PET/CT Imaging as Early Predictor of DP
In this study the investigators would like to describe FDG-PET/CT responses in patients who are receiving CART-19 immunotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) as part of UPCC #13413. Subjects will undergo two FDG-PET/CTs. One performed within 6 weeks of CART-19 infusion and a repeat scan at about 1 month after infusion.

Global objective tumor response measured from serial PET/CT scans, global objective tumor response measured from serial PET/CT scans as the change (absolute and relative (%)) in total metabolically active tumor volume (i.e., the total volume (in cc) of FDG-avid tumor throughout the body) between pre-treatment and post-treatment PET/CT scans., 1 month
