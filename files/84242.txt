Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Oligo-Progressive Metastatic Cancer (The STOP Trial)
A multicenter randomized phase II trial of stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligo-progressive metastatic cancers. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio between receiving their standard of care therapy or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to all sites of oligo-progressive lesions.Radiotherapy will be administered as soon as possible following randomization, and subjects will be followed until next disease progression. The primary outcome is progression-free survival (PFS).
Metastatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)|OTHER: Standard of Care Treatment
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival is defined as the time from randomization to progression of disease or death from any cause, 5 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as they time from randomization to death from any cause, 5 years|Quality of Life, Quality of life in domains of physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), 5 years|Toxicity, Toxicity related to radiation treatment will be assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4 for each organ treated (i.e. liver, lung, bone), 5 years|Lesional Control Rate, Local control rate of lesions treated with SABR, 5 years|Total Time on Chemotherapy, Duration of systemic therapy treatment, 5 years|Duration of current systemic agent treatment after SABR, Arm 2 only, 5 years|Location of sites of further progression after SABR, Sites of progressive disease after SABR are captured in follow up, 5 years
