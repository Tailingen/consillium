Number of commercial Antibodies capable of identify specific Prostate Cancer Biomarkers, Qualitative assessment of Staining Positivity for different Prostate Cancer Biomarkers, day 1 : blood collection day
In this research study different commercial RUO (Research Use Only) antibodies will be purchased and then tested on blood samples obtained by patients affected by prostate cancer and by healthy participants as control. Sixty participants will be enrolled belonging to different risk categories:20 participants affected by prostate cancer at low risk, 20 participants affected by prostate cancer at high risk, and 20 participants without a cancer disease (healthy volunteers) as control.

Risk categorization is based on the definition of the European Association of Urology. After signing the informed consent form, participants will be screened to evaluate if they meet the eligibility criteria. If all the criteria are met, participants will be enrolled into the study and will be asked to provide some demographic and other data. A 13 ml blood sample will be collected by the participants and shipped to Sponsor's laboratories, in order to be processed and analysed.
