A Study of Atezolizumab in High PD-L1 Expression, Chemotherapy-Naïve Patients With Stage IV Non-Squamous or Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, single arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in high PD-L1 expression, chemotherapy-naïve, without a sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation patients with stage IV non-squamous or squamous NSCLC.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from atezolizumab initiation to death from any cause., Atezolizumab initiation to death from any cause (up to approximately 28 months)
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from atezolizumab initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Atezolizumab initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), (up to approximately 28 months)|OS Rate at 1-Year, OS rate at 1-year is defined as the probability of participants who have not experienced death from any cause at 1-year after atezolizumab initiation., Atezolizumab initiation to 1-year|OS Rate at 2-Year, OS rate at 2-year is defined as the probability of participants who have not experienced death from any cause at 2-year after atezolizumab initiation., Atezolizumab initiation to 2-year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization up to approximately 34 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first occurrence of an objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization up to approximately 34 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of participants with adverse events., Randomization up to approximately 34 months
