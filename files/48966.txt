Vaccine Therapy in Treating Lung Cancer Patients With Cancer Stem Cells
Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors into immunosuppressed mice, preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and effects of CSCs. In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinct murine tumors after their inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor immunity.
Neoplasms, Lung
BIOLOGICAL: cancer stem cell vaccine
The primary study purpose to determine the safety of immunization with cancer stem cells vaccine by the number of participants with adverse events, up to 3 months
The secondary objectives are to evaluate vaccine immune responses to the immunizations by the data of body measurements, 1 month
The dose of CSC vaccine, up to 3 months
To assess the feasibility of generating CSC-loaded DC vaccines for clinical use, the investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with Lung Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the Lung cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the Lung cancer patient using a similar protocol as investigators reported .

Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-Lung cancer CSC immunity induced by Lung cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of Lung cancer CSCs by antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with Lung cancer CSC-DC.
