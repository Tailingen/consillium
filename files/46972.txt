Axitinib and Oral Metronomic Etoposide for Pediatric Children and AYA Refractory/Relapsing Medulloblastoma and Ependymoma
It is an open multicentric phase I/II trial with axitinib (Inlyta®) and metronomic delivery of etoposide for children, adolescent and young adults (AYA) with refractory/ relapsing solid tumors. It is a two-stage trial:

First stage: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of axitinib and oral metronomic etoposide for patient with medulloblastoma or ependymoma Second stage: Extension cohort evaluating the preliminary efficacy at the recommended dose for the phase II (RDP2) of the combination. The 2nd stage will start after a meeting of independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). Two cohorts of 9 patients with ependymoma and medulloblastoma Patients treated at first stage won't be included in the second stage.
Medulloblastoma|Ependymoma
DRUG: administration of axitinib in combination with etoposide
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), During first stage, During the first 28 days (cycle 1)|Progression-free survival (PFS), During second stage, progression-free survival (PFS) computed as the time interval from the beginning of treatment to the date of centrally-assessed with RAPNO criteria. A central review of all imaging is planned at the end of phase 1 and at the end of phase expansion to evaluate tumor response and progressions. PFS-duration of patients alive free of progression at last follow-up will be censored at the date of last visit., 3 years (from start of treatment to last follow-up visit)
