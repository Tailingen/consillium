Yttrium-90 Radioembolization Using Glass Microspheres (TheraSphere) for Patients With Liver Metastases
This is a prospective pilot study designed to document safety and efficacy of liver-directed therapy for colorectal, neuroendocrine, cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer metastases to the liver using Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere).

DEVICE: Selective internal radiation therapy to the liver using Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse effects of treatment with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere) were collected prospectively for 6 months after each treatment administration., 6 months
Radiographic Response, Radiographic response of treated lesions on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) following treatment with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere) was assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), no change in target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), increase in target lesions., 6 months after treatment
