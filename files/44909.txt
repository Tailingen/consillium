Study of ISB 2001 in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (TRIgnite-1)
This study is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label study that will evaluate safety and anti-myeloma activity of ISB 2001 in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM).
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ISB 2001|DRUG: ISB 2001
Frequency and Severity Of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Up to 18 months|Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) During the First 28 Days After the First Administration of ISB 2001 (Cycle 1) in Each Cohort (Part 1), Up to 28 days
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of ISB 2001 in Serum, Up to 28 days|Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of ISB 2001 in Serum, Up to 28 days|Area Under the Concentration Time Curve in Dosing Intervals (AUC0-tau) of ISB 2001 in Serum, Up to 28 days|Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From Zero to Time t (AUC0-t) of ISB 2001 in Serum, Up to 28 days|Percent Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA), Neutralizing Antibody (nAb) and Titer of ADA From Baseline Until End-of-Treatment (EOT), Baseline to 18 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 18 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR) Based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 18 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 18 months|Time to Progression (TTP), 18 months|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), 18 months|Time to Response (TTR), 18 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), 18 months
The study will enroll participants with R/R MM that have been treated with immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 therapies either in combination or as a single agent and are refractory to, or intolerant of, established therapies known to provide clinical benefit in MM.

The study will be conducted in two parts:

* Part 1: Dose escalation
* Part 2: Dose expansion

Dose escalation will continue until either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined, the maximum planned dose is reached, or a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is selected. Dose expansion cohorts will be initiated to further confirm safety and optimal biologically active dose. Participants will receive ISB 2001 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, any criterion for stopping the study treatment, or participant withdrawal from the study.
