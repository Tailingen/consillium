Phase IIa Study of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered to Contain Anti-CD19 Attached to TCRz and 4-Signaling Domains in Patients With Chemotherapy Relapsed or Refractory CD19+ Lymphomas
Phase IIa study to estimate the efficacy of a single infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCR and 4-1BB (TCR /4-1BB) costimulatory domains (referred to as CART-19 or CTL019 cells) in non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) patients. The duration of active protocol intervention is approximately 24 months from screening visit. The protocol will require approximately 48 months to complete.
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) Patients, With CD19+B Cell Lymphomas
BIOLOGICAL: CART-19
Number of Subjects With an Overall Response (i.e. Either Complete Response or Partial Response) Evaluated at Three Months Post Infusion., Responders will include those patients achieving complete response (CR), complete response unconfirmed (CRu) and partial response (PR) using anatomic imaging such as CT or MRI to assess tumor volume or, in the event of bone marrow involvement, morphologic and immunohistochemical confirmation that the bone marrow infiltrate has been cleared., 3 months
