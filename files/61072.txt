Multiparametric MRI as a Non-Invasive Biomarker of the Tumor Microenviroment
This study is looking at how an imaging test could help doctors understand if a patient with early breast cancer will respond to drugs that use the patient's immune system to fight cancer.
Breast Cancer|Triple-negative Breast Cancer
OTHER: Tempus assay|OTHER: Advanced pathology 1|OTHER: Advanced pathology 2
Correlate dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI characteristics, Baseline up to about 14 weeks|Correlate diffusion weight imaging MRI characteristics, Baseline up to about 14 weeks
Evaluate association between MRI features and pathologic response, Baseline up to about 14 weeks|Evaluate association between MRI features and recurrence-free survival, Baseline up to about 14 weeks
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate serial multiparametric MRI as an early marker for tumor immune response to an immune checkpoint inhibitor agent

Secondary Objective:

* To assess the potential of early treatment imaging changes on MRI to discern final tumor treatment response
* To assess the prognostic potential of MRI features

Correlative:

* To correlate MRI features with immunophenotypes (i.e. hot and cold tumors)
* To evaluate the association of MRI features with other known biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitor response
