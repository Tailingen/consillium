Thalidomide Enhances Clinical Efficacy of Cetuximab Combined With Standard Chemotherapy for Left Colorectal Cancer
1. To verify that thalidomide can increase the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the treatment of stage IV RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable left colorectal cancer, which has important clinical significance and provides a basis for subsequent large-scale research and clinical application.
2. To evaluate the changes of cytokines and verify the effect of some cytokines on the efficacy of cetuximab +FOLFIRI, so as to provide a scientific basis for the subsequent precise therapy using cytokines antibodies.
