Effect of Parecoxib Sodium and Flurbiprofen Injection on Postoperative Shivering
Shivering is an early postoperative complication during the postoperative recovery period, and there is no clear consensus about the best way for its prevention. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and accompanying side effects of prophylactic flurbiprofen with that of parecoxib or placebo for reducing postoperative shivering.

154 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, who were scheduled for colorectal operation under general anesthesia, were randomly assigned to receive flurbiprofen (Group F), parecoxib sodium (Group P ) or normal saline(Group S)40min before the end of surgery. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored. The occurrence of shivering postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded during the recovery period. And visual analogue score (VAS) and ramsy sedation scale (RSS) were also recorded.
