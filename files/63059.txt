Ph II OSI-774 (Erlotinib,Tarceva) In Advanced Bronchioloalveolar Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the major objective response rate of OSI-774 in participants with unresectable or metastatic bronchioloalveolar cell variant of non-small cell lung cancer.

This study is a Phase II study. The first study of OSI-774 was done to evaluate what dose should be given to patients with cancer has been completed. The purpose of this research study is to see whether this experimental treatment, called OSI-774, can cause a type of non-small cell lung cancer to stop growing or shrink. This study is sponsored by a company called Genentech, and is being done at Memorial Hospital, as well as other cancer centers around the country interested in developing new drugs for the treatment of this type of cancer.
Bronchioloalveolar Cell Variant of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: OSI-774: erlotinib, TarcevaTM
Overall Objective Response of OSI-774, (complete and partial responses) Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. A complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions, and a partial response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions. Stable disease is defined as fitting the criteria neither for progressive disease nor a PR., 53 weeks
