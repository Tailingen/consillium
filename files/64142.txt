the pressure on the affected eye, the pressure on the affected eye using the two methods, 10 minutes after bandage application in awake individuals
the pressure outside the affected eye, the pressure outside the affected eye using the two methods, 10 minutes after bandage application in awake individuals|discomfort scores, Discomfort levels were measured using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no discomfort and 10 represents the worst discomfort; this scale has been confirmed to be sensitive and reliable. Discomfort was defined as "sensation other than pain" and included nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Clinically significant postoperative discomfort was considered serious discomfort (NRS score â‰¥5) any time postoperatively., 1 minute after recording the pressures
