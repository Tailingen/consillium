A Study of Sunitinib in Combination With Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel in Previously Untreated Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (SABRE-B)
This is a multicenter, Phase II, randomized, controlled, open label trial designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of sunitinib when combined with bevacizumab and paclitaxel in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: sunitinib|DRUG: paclitaxel
Best Response, The best overall response is the best response, per the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, recorded from randomization until disease progression/recurrence (includes both confirmed and unconfirmed responses). Although the original primary outcome was progression-free survival, there was insufficient data available to report on that outcome., From randomization until disease progression/recurrence (by patient)
