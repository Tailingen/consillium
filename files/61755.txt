Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis and Extraesophageal Reflux
The purpose of the study was to determine, whether patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) suffer from extra oesophageal reflux more often than patients with laryngeal cyst (control group).
Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis|Extra Oesophageal Reflux|Laryngeal Cyst
PROCEDURE: Surgical collection of histology specimen|PROCEDURE: Performance of immunohistochemical analysis
Occurrence of EER (percentage), The occurrence of extra oesophageal reflux will be assessed in both study groups., 36 months
Presence of pepsin, The presence of pepsin (yes-no) will be assessed in both study groups., 36 months
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a chronic viral disease, which affects children and adults as well. It is characterised by grow of squamous cell tumours on mucosa of aerodigestive tract, with predilection for the larynx. The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). However, in contrast to the low incidence of RRP, HPV prevalence is common. It is indicated that other factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of RRP. One such factor might be extraesophageal reflux (EER). We investigated whether patients with RRP suffer more often from EER.
