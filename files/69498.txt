The Effect of Music on Pain and Anxiety in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy During COVID-19
Introduction: This study has been conducted to determine the effect of music on pain and anxiety levels in patients receiving chemotherapy during COVID-19.

Methods: The research has been carried out in a real trial model with adult patients receiving chemotherapy. The sample of the study is consisted of 92 patients (45 in the experimental group and 47 for the control group). The data have been collected by the researcher with Google Forms (using State and Transient Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analog Skala) between March 2020 and July 2020, through the links sent to the phones of participants on the day they received chemotherapy.

Results: The mean scores obtained from the post-test STAI (53.11±4.77) and VAS (3.44±2.53) scales in the experimental group have been determined to statistically significantly decrease when compared to the pre-test measurement data (STAI:54.26±4.26; VAS:4.22±2.41) (p\<0.05). No statistically significant difference has been determined between pre-test and post-test mean scores of the patients in the control group.

Conclusion: It has been observed that music applications reduce the pain and anxiety levels of patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process. It can be recommended to use music applications in the management of pain and anxiety symptoms.
