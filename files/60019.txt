Prehabilitation and RecOVERy From Surgery for Breast Cancer Study
Background and study aims:

Nine out of ten women experience some negative effects due to their disease or its treatment such as anxiety, depression, weight gain and low quality of life. Research shows that exercise may help women overcome some of these effects. The investigators also know that most women become physically inactive after cancer treatment. Therefore, The investigators feel it is important that women get into a routine of doing regular exercise before they start their cancer treatment, this is called prehabilitation. The investigators believe that prehabilitation might help to build confidence and help women to continue exercising after their cancer treatment.

The investigators are doing this study to find out if a remote (NHS Attend Anywhere), multimodal (aerobic, resistance and targeted exercise), behavioural change (Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), dyadic coping (the collective effort to dealing with the stress of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment), and wearable technology), multiphasic (pre- and post-surgery) intervention is feasible in the short time frame between diagnosis of breast cancer and surgery (less than 31 days). The investigators would also like to find out whether it is feasible for women to begin an exercise rehabilitation programme two weeks after their operation. If successful, the results will potentially enable us in the future to tailor the support gievn to women to help them prepare and recover from breast cancer treatment.
