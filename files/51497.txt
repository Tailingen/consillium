A Study of ASTX030 (Cedazuridine in Combination With Azacitidine) in MDS, CMML, or AML
Study ASTX030-01 is designed to move efficiently from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Phase 1 consists of an open-label Dose Escalation Stage (Stage A) using multiple cohorts at escalating dose levels of oral cedazuridine and azacitidine (only one study drug will be escalated at a time) followed by a Dose Expansion Stage (Stage B). Phase 2 is a randomized, open-label, crossover study to compare oral ASTX030 to subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine. Phase 3 is a randomized open-label crossover study comparing the final oral ASTX030 dose to SC azacitidine. The duration of this phase 1-3 study is approximately 7 years.
