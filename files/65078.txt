A Phase 2b Study of UGN-102 for Low Grade Intermediate Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
This Phase 2b, single-arm, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of UGN-102 as primary chemoablative therapy in patients with low grade intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (LG IR NMIBC).

DRUG: UGN-102
Complete Response (CR) Rate for UGN-102 Treatment, To evaluate the tumor ablative effect of UGN-102 in patients with LG NMIBC. CR rate was defined as the percentage of patients with no detectable disease (NDD) as determined by cystoscopy, for cause biopsy, and urine cytology., 3 months after the first instillation of UGN-102
Durable Complete Response (DCR) Rate, To evaluate the durability of response in patients with LG NMIBC who achieve CR. DCR rate was defined as the percentage of patients who maintained CR at the respective time point., 6, 9, and 12 months after the first instillation of UGN-102|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Study Drug or Procedure Related TEAEs, TEAEs by Maximum Severity, TEAEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation, and Serious TEAEs., The number of patients with each type of event will be summarized. Adverse event severity was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 as follows: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe or medically significant), Grade 4 (life-threatening), Grade 5 (fatal)., Up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Post-baseline Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) Laboratory Values, The number of patients who met PCS criteria for chemistry or hematology parameters post-baseline will be summarized, Up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Post-baseline PCS Vital Signs Values, The number of patients who met PCS criteria for vital signs parameters post-baseline will be summarized, Up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Post-baseline Clinically Significant (CS) Physical Examination Findings, The number of patients with abnormal, CS physical examination findings post-baseline will be summarized, Up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Post-baseline CS Urology-oriented Physical Examination Findings, The number of patients with abnormal, CS urology-oriented physical examination findings post-baseline will be summarized, Up to 12 months
Mitomycin Plasma Concentrations, Mitomycin plasma concentrations were assessed in a subset of 6 patients treated with UGN-102, 0 (pre-instillation), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after the first instillation of UGN-102|Mitomycin Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC), Mitomycin AUC was assessed in a subset of 6 patients treated with UGN-102, 0 (pre-instillation) to 6 hours after the first instillation of UGN-102|Mitomycin Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Mitomycin Cmax was assessed in a subset of 6 patients treated with UGN-102, 0 (pre-instillation), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after the first instillation of UGN-102
Eligible patients were treated with 6 once-weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102.

The ablative effect of UGN-102 was evaluated at the 3-month Visit, which occurred 5 weeks Â± 1 week after the last weekly instillation (3 months after initiation of study drug). Response was determined based on visual evaluation by cystoscopy (appearance, number, and size of the lesions) and, if there were remaining lesions, by histopathology of the remaining lesions. Complete response (CR) was defined as having no detectable disease (NDD) and was assessed visually during cystoscopy and also by urine cytology. In the event that the investigator was not sure, and there was suspect tissue, a small biopsy was taken from the suspect tissue to confirm CR in addition to cystoscopy and urine cytology.

Patients who achieved a CR continued to have monthly telephone contacts to document any adverse events (AEs) and changes in concomitant medications and were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months after the first instillation of UGN-102 for evidence of disease recurrence. Patients who had a non-complete response (non-CR) discontinued the study and continued with standard of care according to their treating physician.

Safety was determined based on a review of AEs, laboratory assessments, and physical examination findings.
