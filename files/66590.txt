A Phase 1b Study to Assess Sitravatinib in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This was an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized Phase 1b clinical trial for participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic tumors including non-squamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ovarian cancer (OC), or melanoma.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Sitravatinib|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), which includes laboratory tests, physical exams, electrocardiogram results and vital signs; TEAE was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug(s) up to 30 days following last dose of study drug(s) or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 4 years and 2 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Efficacy was evaluated by cohort, as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan., Up to approximately 4 years and 2 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response until the first documentation of progressive disease, whichever comes first, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Results are reported for cohorts with responders, defined as CR or PR. Efficacy was evaluated by cohort, as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan., Up to approximately 4 years and 2 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy was evaluated by cohort, as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan., Up to approximately 4 years and 2 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documentation of progressive disease or death, whichever comes first, as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy was evaluated by cohort, as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan., Up to approximately 4 years and 2 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Sitravatinib, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1D21); 21 days per cycle|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) for Sitravatinib, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Measurable Time Point (AUC(0-t)) for Sitravatinib, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle|Clearance After Oral Administration (CL/F) for Sitravatinib, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve During the Dosing Interval (AUC(0-tau)) for Sitravatinib, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle|Observed Accumulation Ratio (Ro) for AUC0-tau for Sitravatinib, Presented as geometric mean ratio and confidence interval, transformed from the difference of least square means and confidence interval of the least square differences in the logarithmic scale by exponentiation, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle|Observed Accumulation Ratio (Ro) for Cmax for Sitravatinib, Presented as geometric mean ratio and confidence interval, transformed from the difference of least square means and confidence interval of the least square differences in the logarithmic scale by exponentiation, Predose and up to 24 hours post dose on C1D1 and C1D21; 21 days per cycle
All participants received sitravatinib 120 mg orally once daily in combination with tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks until occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by sponsor. Participants were enrolled according to their tumor type and prior anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 antibody treatment into the following cohorts:

* Cohort A: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody refractory/resistant metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC
* Cohort B: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody naïve metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC
* Cohort C: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody refractory/resistant metastatic or advanced RCC
* Cohort D: Metastatic or advanced RCC without prior systemic therapy
* Cohort E: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody naïve recurrent and platinum resistant epithelial OC
* Cohort F: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treated metastatic, squamous NSCLC
* Cohort G: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody refractory/resistant unresectable or metastatic melanoma
* Cohort H: PD-L1 positive, locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC without prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting
* Cohort I: PD-L1 positive, locally advanced or metastatic, squamous NSCLC without prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting
