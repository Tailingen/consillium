ORIOn-E: A Study Evaluating CPI-1205 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study of CPI-1205 + ipilimumab in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors. This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPI-1205 + ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients in Phase 2 will be treated at the RP2D of CPI-1205 + ipilimumab.

This study was stopped prior to proceeding to Phase 2; no patients were enrolled in Phase 2.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: CPI-1205|DRUG: ipilimumab
Phase 1: Frequency of Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), The RP2D will be selected based on the PK, pharmacodynamics and overall tolerability of the regimen, but will not exceed the MTD., 1 year|Phase 2: Objective response rate, The rate of confirmed complete responses (CR) + partial responses (PR) as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 1 year
Objective response rate, The rate of confirmed iCR + iPR, 1 year|Clinical Benefit Rate, The rate of CR + PR + stable disease (SD) after 3 months of treatment as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria and as the rate of iCR + iPR + iSD after 3 months of treatment by iRECIST criteria, 3 months|Time to response, The time from day (D) 1 of treatment to the date of first response as determined by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, 1 year|Duration of Response, The time from measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR or iCR/iPR (whichever is first recorded) until the date of recurrence or progressive disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, 1 year|Duration of treatment, The time from D1 of treatment until the date treatment is discontinued for any reason, 1 year|Progression free survival, The time from D1 of treatment to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first with progressive disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, 6 months|Adverse Events, AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03)., 1 year
