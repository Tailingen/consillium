Robot-assisted D2 Distal Gastrectomy Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancers
To evaluate the safety of robot-assisted radical gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection in postoperative complications in patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer (cT3-4a, N+, M0).
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robot-assisted D2 distal gastrectomy
Total incidence of postoperative complications, Postoperative complications are defined as complications occurring within 30 days after surgery, and will be classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system, Postoperative 30 days
Hospital mortality, Hospital mortality is defined as death occurring within 30 days after initial surgery, regardless of the cause, Postoperative 30 days|R0 resection rate, The day of surgery|Robotic surgical completion rate, The day of surgery
To evaluate the safety of robot-assisted radical gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection in postoperative complications in patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer (cT3-4a, N+, M0).
