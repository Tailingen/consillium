PLAT-08: a Study of SC-DARIC33 CAR T Cells in Pediatric and Young Adults with Relapsed or Refractory CD33+ AML
A phase 1, open-label, non-randomized study enrolling pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD33+ leukemia with and without prior history of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, to examine the safety and feasibility of administering an autologous T cell product that has been genetically modified to express a Dimerizing Agent Regulated Immunoreceptor Complex (DARIC).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia Refractory|Acute Myeloid Leukemia, in Relapse
BIOLOGICAL: SC-DARIC33
Adverse events associated with SC-DARIC33 cell product infusions will be assessed, The type, frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events will be summarized, 28 days post-infusion|Ability to successfully manufacture SC-DARIC33, Measure of the number of successfully manufactured SC-DARIC33 products, 28 days
Acute Myeloid Leukemia response to SC-DARIC in subjects with relapsed or refractory CD33+ myeloid leukemia will be assessed, The efficacy of the SC-DARIC33 assessed based on the bone marrow aspirate testing following SC-DARIC infusion, 28 days post-infusion
