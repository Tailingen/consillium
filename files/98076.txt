68Ga-NY104 PET/CT in Patients With Metastasis/Recurrence Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Suspicion
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase 2 study in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and metastasis or recurrence suspicion. The goal is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and metastasis or recurrence suspicion
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT
Binary reading of lesions identified on 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT, Any focal accumulation in the lesion suspected of metastasis or recurrence that cannot be explained by physiologic uptake of 68Ga-NY104 will be interpreted as PET positive., From study completion to 1 month after completion
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase 2 study in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and metastasis or recurrence suspicion. Each patient will receive one dose of 68Ga-NY104. Dedicated whole-body PET/CT imaging will be performed. PET/CT studies will be interpreted by two readers, both of whom will provide independent and blinded interpretations. Imaging interpretations and a composite ground truth will be used to estimate the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT.

A total of 40 patients will be recruited at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
