Mayzent (Siponimod) Onboarding of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) Patients With MSGo
This study was a retrospective, non-interventional, longitudinal, descriptive study. This study did not have a key underlying hypothesis, rather it was designed to explore the onboarding and adherence of SPMS patients in Australia to Mayzent (siponimod) treatment.

Initiating siponimod involves pre-screen tests, including a CYP2C9 genotype test to determine siponimod maintenance dosing, and patients underwent a 6-day titration prior to maintenance. The MSGo platform was developed to support onboarding. It is an integrated digital platform that functions as a patient support service.
