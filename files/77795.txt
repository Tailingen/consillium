A Multiple Ascending Dose Study of MEDI7247 in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
To assess safety and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities, assess the preliminary antitumor activity, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose (maximum administered dose) in the absence of establishing the MTD, and a recommended dose for further evaluation of MEDI7247 in patients with selected advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies that have received at least 1 prior line of treatment.
