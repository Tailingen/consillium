Financial Difficulty in Patients With Blood Cancer
This is a hypothesis-driven, observational, cross-sectional, multi-site study of the financial difficulties experienced by patients undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is composed of a patient survey (n=250) (Appendix A), a physician survey (n=100) (Appendix B), and a practice survey completed by each site enrolling patients onto this study (Appendix C). A subset of enrolled patients (n=35) will be invited to participate in an optional second telephone interview (Appendix D). This study will measure the prevalence of patient-reported financial difficulty, specific financial burdens and resources currently available to patients and from practices to assist with patient financial navigation.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma
To estimate the proportion of patients with MM and/or CLL who report experiencing financial difficulty in the past 12 months., Financial difficulties will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) financial difficulty item #28 regarding financial difficulties with a modified recall period: "Has your physical condition or medical treatment caused you financial difficulties in the past year?", measured as "Not at all/A little/Quite a bit/Very much." Participant responses will be dichotomized as follows: "Not at all" or "A little" classified as "No", and "Quite a bit" and "very much" classified as "Yes." This dichotomized response will be assessed using Wilson score confidence interval (95%)., Cross-sectional study / Baseline

These questions are all assessed as "Very worried", "Somewhat worried" and "Not worried" will be scored as 2, 1 and 0 respectively and aggregated using standard practices.
