Cancer|Diabetes
OTHER: Fitbit|OTHER: Continuous Glucose Monitor
To evaluate the feasibility of the ( PA) Physical Activity intervention., The use of CGM through the following criteria: CGM-specific refusal rate \<20% at the participant recruitment phase and protocol adherence rates \>80% at the end of the monitoring period., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary objective:

To evaluate the feasibility of a CGM-based physical activity intervention that includes the use of CGM and FitbitÂ®.

Secondary objectives:

To examine changes in physical activity motivation and other related psychosocial variables (e.g., intention, perceived benefits, outcome expectancy) before and after the intervention.

Exploratory objective:
