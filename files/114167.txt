A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Tiragolumab Plus Atezolizumab, With or Without Platinum-Based Chemotherapy, in Participants With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced Resectable Stage II, IIIA, or Select IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the surgical safety and feasibility of atezolizumab plus tiragolumab alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for participants with previously untreated locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will also evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety of atezolizumab plus tiragolumab alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant atezolizumab plus tiragolumab or adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.
