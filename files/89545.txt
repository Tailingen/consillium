Effect of Anthracyclines and Cyclophosphamide on Cardiovascular Responses
The present study aims to investigate the chronic effect of treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on neurovascular control and blood pressure in women undergoing adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.

The development of new drugs and different adjuvant therapeutic regimens, based on the combination of anthracycline (A) and cyclophosphamide (C), have contributed greatly to improve survival rate in breast cancer patients. Despite the clinical benefits of this therapy, AC treatment can cause cardiovascular acute and chronic changes. In a recent investigation, we observed that an acute AC chemotherapy session increases sympathetic nervous activity and blood pressure in patients with breast cancer.

The present study aims to investigate the chronic effects of AC regimen on sympathetic nervous activity, peripheral vasoconstriction, endothelial microparticles and blood pressure, in women with breast cancer.
