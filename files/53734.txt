Study of Cabozantinib in Combination With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase 3 trial of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with matched placebo. Approximately 840 eligible subjects with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced or metastatic RCC by IMDC criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio at approximately 180 sites.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Cabozantinib-matched placebo
Duration of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as determined by blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC), Up to 23 months after first subject randomized
Duration of Overall Survival (OS), Up to 69 months after first subject randomized
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase 3 trial of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with matched placebo. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab ("triplet") on the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) versus nivolumab and ipilimumab. A secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of triplet combination on the duration of overall survival (OS).
