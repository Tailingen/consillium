Improved Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: Bladder Suspension and Preliminary Outcomes
This study is a prospective, single-center clinical trial. It aims to establish an improved robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for treating locally advanced prostate cancer. The technique evaluates the impact of preserving the anterior peritoneum of the bladder on postoperative bladder descent and urinary control recovery. A retrospective analysis compares this modified approach with traditional anterior approach surgery, assessing differences in oncological outcomes, early functional recovery, and postoperative complication rates. The goal is to provide new theoretical foundations and technical support for the prevention and treatment of postoperative urinary incontinence.
