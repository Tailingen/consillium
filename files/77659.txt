Short Course Radiation Therapy in Palliative Treatment
The study wants to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of a short course radiation treatment in patients with symptomatic advanced head and neck cancer.
Palliative Care
RADIATION: Short course radiotherapy
Maximum tolerated dose, The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level below the highest administered dose associated with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one third of patients, 1 year
Acute toxicity, Acute toxicity after treatment is evaluated with CTCAE scale, 1 year|Quality of life, Quality of life after the treatment is evaluated according to CLAS scale, 1 year|Pain relief, Pain after the therapy is evaluated with the visual analogic scale, 1 year|Late toxicity, Late toxicity after the treatment is evaluated with EORTC-RTOG scale, 1 year
The study wants to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a conformal short course accelerated radiation therapy delivered in twice daily fractions and 2 consecutive days, and the feasibility of this fractionation in term of safety and efficacy for symptomatic palliation of metastatic or locally advanced head and neck cancer.
