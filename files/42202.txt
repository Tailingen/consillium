A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3303 Tablets
TQB3303 tablet is a small molecule oral drug inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 / 6). Based on current research, overexpression of positive regulatory proteins in the cell cycle is one of the important reasons for resistance to endocrine therapy. CDK4 / 6 is the key regulators of the cell cycle inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
