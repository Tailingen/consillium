Daratumumab for Chemotherapy-Refractory Minimal Residual Disease in T Cell ALL
In this study, the investigators are hypothesizing that daratumumab-hyaluronidase will effectively treat T-ALL in patients who have persistent or recurrent MRD following treatment with chemotherapy.

The primary hypothesis is that daratumumab-hyaluronidase will effectively eliminate chemotherapy refractory and relapsed MRD in T-ALL. The secondary hypotheses include; daratumumab-hyaluronidase will improve hematologic relapse free survival (RFS),daratumumab-hyaluronidase will improve overall survival (OS), patients that achieve complete MRD response with daratumumab will have improved survival outcomes, and daratumumab-hyaluronidase will be well tolerated in T-ALL after allogenic stem cell transplant.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of complete MRD response by flow cytometry after 4 weekly doses of daratumumab-hyaluronidase (Day 29) among patients with MRD positive T-ALL in hematologic morphologic complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery. The secondary objectives include; evaluation of morphologic relapse free survival (RFS), evaluation of overall survival (OS), assessment of the the survival outcomes in patients that undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant after complete MRD response with daratumumab-hyaluronidase, assessment of adverse effects and tolerability of daratumumab-hyaluronidase in T-ALL, and assessment of flow cytometry based MRD status on Day 64 of treatment or upon count recovery for patients that receive chemotherapy in addition to daratumumab-hyaluronidase during Course 1A.
