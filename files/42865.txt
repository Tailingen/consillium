Development of a Multi-omics Prediction Model for Immunotherapy Response in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Subtypes
This study aims to collect clinical samples from breast cancer patients who have undergone or are expected to undergo immunotherapy at our institution. The samples, including fresh tissue from diagnostic punctures, residual tumor tissue post-surgery, blood samples, and imaging data, will be used to build a predictive model for immunotherapy efficacy. The research will employ proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics sequencing, imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and spatial transcriptomics to construct a multi-omics, multi-dimensional (temporal and spatial) model to predict the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

Predictive Accuracy of Immunotherapy Efficacy Model, The primary outcome is the predictive accuracy of the multi-omics and multi-dimensional model in determining the efficacy of immunotherapy in breast cancer patients. The model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify patients as responders or non-responders to immunotherapy using clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free survival, overall survival) as the gold standard., From the date of sample collection (retrospective cohort: 2015-2023; prospective cohort: 2023-present) until the end of follow-up (up to 5 years post-treatment).
Correlation Between Multi-Omics Profiles and Immunotherapy Response, To assess the relationship between proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic profiles of tumor tissue and the clinical response to immunotherapy., From the date of sample collection until the end of follow-up (up to 5 years post-treatment).
This research will utilize a comprehensive approach by analyzing various types of clinical samples from breast cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. The integration of proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data, along with advanced imaging techniques like IMC and spatial transcriptomics, will allow for a detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its response to immunotherapy. This multi-dimensional analysis aims to enhance the accuracy of predicting immunotherapy outcomes, thereby aiding in personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. The study adheres strictly to ethical guidelines, ensuring patient confidentiality and welfare are maintained throughout the research process.
