Safety and Effectiveness of CATHTONGâ„¢ II PICC
This clinical trial is a prospective, multi-centre, open, parallel and comparative non-inferior trial design.
Cancer
DEVICE: PICC with high pressure tolerance|DEVICE: rontine central venous catheter
Successful rate of one-time catheterization, Subcutaneous detection of blood vessel movements less than three times, and finally completed catheterization and confirmed that the end of the catheter in the pre-positioning proportion of the total number of patients (catheterization success refers to the chest X-ray and other fluoroscopy means to confirm that the end of the catheter is located in the middle and lower segment of superior vena cava)., Day 1
Operating time, The time between the beginning of disinfection of the patient's skin and the fixing of transparent dressing is in minutes., Day 1|success rate of one puncture., Success of one puncture refers to entering the target vein only once. If the puncture needle failed to penetrate the vein once and retreated to the subcutaneous area, then exploratory puncture was the second puncture., Day 1|The incidence of adverse events, Record the adverse events in the test, determine whether they are related to the test product, and calculate the incidence of adverse events/reactions., about three months
Four clinical trial institutions that meet the national qualification are selected as clinical research centers. After informed consent of the subjects and meeting the selection criteria, the subjects will be included in this clinical study. After the follow-up, all the data were sorted out and analyzed. Finally, the data of the two groups were compared to prove whether the high-pressure-resistant peripherally inserted central venous catheter developed by L\&Z US, Inc. was not inferior to the control group.
