Non Elective Vulnerable Elderly Radiotherapy
To evaluate whether patients defined "non-fit for curative non-surgical radio-chemotherapy" and therefore treated with RT alone addressed only to non-elective sites of disease, could obtain a non-inferior loco-regional control compared to similar historical cohorts.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
RADIATION: Non elective radiotherapy
Loco-regional control, clinical or radiological (RECIST 1.1) disease progression from end of treatment with tumor present, or to the date of salvage surgery of primary tumor with tumor present performed for clinical or radiological (RECIST 1.1) disease progression, whichever comes first., 24 months after the start of treatment
rate of severe sub-acute or late toxicity, assessment of toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0 scale, at 6 and 12 months after the completion of radiotherapy|Cause-specific mortality rates, Patients who died from cancer/total amount, within 3 months after start of treatment|overall survival, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death for any cause, 5 years|progression free survival, per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, 12 and 24 months|G8 role, correlation between G8 pre-screening evaluation and toxicity, 6 and 12 months
radiomics, evaluation of radiomics features in study population: using an automated high-throughput extraction of large amounts of quantitative features, through study completion, an average of 5 year
The current standard approach for head and neck malignancies cannot be considered the gold standard for elderly patients, except in carefully selected cases. Given the relevance of this population, scientific societies also suggest to propose prospective studies for this subset of frail patients (European Organization for Research and treatment of cancer (EORTC), European Society for Medical oncology (ESMO)). In addition, it is necessary to collect data on specific categories, which are as homogeneous as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a tailored RT approach administered with a curative intent in a subset of frails elderly patients not candidates neither to standard concurrent RT-CT / RT-cetuximab nor to palliative treatment/best supportive care.
