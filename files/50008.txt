ALK/ROS1/MET Mutations on Plasma ctDNA in Patients With NSCLC
The study aims to explore the prevalence of ALK/ROS1/MET mutations assessed with ctDNA samples in EGFR-wildtype NSCLC

GENETIC: ctDNA analysis
Proportion of patients with ALK/ROS1/MET mutations detected by single molecule amplifcation and re-sequencing technology (cSMART), The investigators will describe the proportion of ALK/ROS1/MET mutations on ctDNA detected by cSMART in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), up to 2 years|Proportion of patients with ALK/ROS1/MET mutations detected by single molecule amplifcation and re-sequencing technology (cSMART) after crizotinib resistance, The investigators will describe the proportion of ALK/ROS1/MET mutations on ctDNA detected by cSMART in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after crizotinib resistance, up to 2 years
