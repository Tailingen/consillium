Abemaciclib in Treating Patients With Advanced, Refractory, and Unresectable Digestive System Neuroendocrine Tumors
This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with digestive system neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body, do not respond to treatment, and cannot be removed by surgery. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as complete or partial response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1, will be represented by a waterfall plot., Up to 1 year after completion of study treatment
Progression-free survival, The distribution for survival times will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier; associated landmark time percentages and the median value will be based on this. Confidence intervals for median values will use the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. Survival outcomes between carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET)s will be compared using a log-rank test., From study registration to radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1 (investigator assessment), clinical progression, or death of any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Overall survival, The distribution for survival times will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier; associated landmark time percentages and the median value will be based on this. Confidence intervals for median values will use the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. Survival outcomes between carcinoid tumors and PNETs will be compared using a log-rank test., Time from study registration to death of any cause, assessed up to 1 year|Incidence of adverse events, Safety will be evaluated by assessing the adverse events according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., Up to 30 days
Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4 months for up to 1 year.
