Circulating Exosomes As Potential Prognostic And Predictive Biomarkers In Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients ("EXO-PPP Study")
Exosomes are formed by inward budding of late endosomes, producing multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and are released into the environment by fusion of the MVBs with the plasma membrane. It has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced. Tumor exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis.

In this prospective translational study, preclinical and clinical phases have been designed. On the first step, the main goal is to characterize the molecular profile of gastric cancer derived exosomes. This exosome biosignature may provide a useful diagnostic tool. As a second step, the study will evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of gastric cancer exosomes levels in plasma and kinetics in a prospectively recruited cohort of advanced gastric cancer patients during first-line chemotherapy.
Gastric Cancer
• Characterization of the molecular profile in tumor derived exosomes from advanced gastric cancer patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy, Up to 2 years from start of study|• Correlation of plasma level and kinetics of gastric cancer derived exosomes (at baseline and monthly during therapy until tumor progression or death) and time-to-event end-points: Overall survival, Progression-free survival and Overall response rate., Up to 3 years from start of the study
