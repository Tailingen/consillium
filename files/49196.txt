Study of Cabozantinib With Lu-177 in Patients With Somatostatin Receptor 2 Positive Neuroendocrine Tumors
The phase I objective of this study is to establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib in 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg dose escalation cohorts in combination with Lu-177 dotatate at a standard dose of 7.4 GBq in four (4) 8-week cycles followed by continuation cabozantinib.

Establish the maximal tolerated dose of cabozantinib in combination with Lu-177 dotatae at a standard dose of 7.4 GBg in four 8-week cycles followed by continuation of cabozantinib., The phase I objective of this study is to establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib in 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg dose escalation cohorts in combination with Lu-177 dotatate at a standard dose of 7.4 GBq in four (4) 8-week cycles followed by continuation cabozantinib. Due to overlapping toxicities of cabozantinib and Lu-177 dotatate and to allow more incremental dose escalation of cabozantinib, alternating day dosing of 40mg/20mg and 60mg/40mg cohorts are incorporated into the schema. This is expected to reduce the risk of overlapping toxicities while still achieving radio-sensitizing anti-angiogenic, multi-targeted therapy in combination with the beta-emitting radiation from lutetium 177 synergistic due to the prolonged half-life of cabozantinib., Up to 2 years
Establish objective response rate as measured by RECIST 1.1, The secondary outcome measure is to establish the objective response rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Imaging is done every 16 weeks and/or re-staging through study completion up to 2 years. A minimum observed overall response rate (ORR) of ≥ 25% in the PRRT-naïve cohort, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in the treatment population would justify further randomized efficacy studies., Up to 2 years post study completion
Patients will be treated four (4) cycles of combination cabozantinib with Lu-177 DOTATATE followed by maintenance cabozantinib. Cycles 1-4 combination cabozantinib with Lu-177 DOTATATE is given in 8-week cycles, with cabozantinib initiated on day 1 and Lu-177 DOTATATE given on day 14. Cabozantinib dosing is escalated during cycles 1-4 in the following manner: dose cohort 1 patients receive cabozantinib 20 mg daily, cohort 2 receive 40mg qod alternating with 20 mg qod, cohort 3 receive 40 mg qd, dose cohort 4 receive 60 mg qod alternating with 40 mg qod, and dose cohort 5 receive 60 mg qd. In all cohorts, during cycle 5 and beyond, single-agent maintenance cabozantinib is given in 4-week cycles in a qd dosing scheduling as follows: 20 mg qd cohort 1; 40 mg qd cohort 2; 40 mg qd cohort 3; 60 mg qd cohort 4; 60 mg qd cohort 5, until disease progression.
