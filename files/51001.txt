Safety and Efficacy Study of TAK-700 in Patients With Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer and a Rising Prostate-specific Antigen
This is a multicenter phase 2 open-label single-arm study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAK-700 in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) without radiographic evidence of metastases who have a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: TAK-700
To determine the percentage of patients who achieve a PSA less than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL following 3 months of TAK-700 treatment, 3 months
To determine PSA response rate (PSA decline of at least 90%, 50% and 30% from baseline)at 3 and 6 months, 3 and 6 months|To determine the percentage of patients who achieve a PSA less than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL following 6 months of TAK-700 treatment, 6 months|To determine time to PSA progression, time to metastases, and duration of progression-free survival, Evidence of PSA or disease progression|To monitor changes in endocrine markers, Evidence of PSA or disease progression|To evaluate the safety of TAK-700, Evidence of PSA or disease progression
