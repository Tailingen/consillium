Study of Imiquimod Cream Prior to Ablative Therapy in External Ano-Genital Warts
The purpose of this study is to compare the recurrence rate following total clearance of external genital warts (EGWs) when clearance has been obtained by imiquimod (3 applications per week for 4 weeks) followed by ablative therapy (laser or electrocautery therapy) with that from just ablative therapy treatment alone.
Genital Warts
DRUG: Imiquimod|OTHER: vehicle cream
recuurence rate 24 weeks after ablative therapy, 24 weeks
Time to recurrence|Recurrence rate at 4 and 12 weeks post ablation, 4 and 12 weeks|Reduction of EGW area, 4 and 12 weeks|Healing and cosmetic outcome, 4, 12 and 24 weeks|Local and general tolerability|Percent of complete clearance after initial topical treatment, up to 6 weeks after initial topical treatment|Occurrence of new lesions
To compare the recurrence rate 24 weeks after ablative therapy in subjects with external genital warts trated with imiquimod, 3 applications per week for 4 weeks followed by ablative therapy versus vehicle, 3 applications per week for 4 weeks followed by ablative therapy. A recurrence is defined as the investoigator-assessed occurrence of lesion(s) within the baseline area cleared by the treatment: imiquimod/vehicle then ablative therapy (either the initial ablative ther√°py session (A0), or if required for complete clearance of baseline lesions, a second ablative therapy session (A2).
