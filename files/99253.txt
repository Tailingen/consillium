A Pilot Study of Glioma Associated Antigen Vaccines in Conjunction with Poly-ICLC in Pediatric Gliomas
The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data following administration of vaccinations with HLA-A2. This data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted.
Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Pontine Glioma|Newly Diagnosed Pediatric High Grade Glioma|Recurrent Pediatric High Grade Glioma|Recurrent Pediatric Low Grade Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: HLA-A2 restricted glioma antigen peptides vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Poly-ICLC
Safety: Tolerability during the first two vaccine courses as defined in the protocol., Tolerability during the first two vaccine courses as defined in the protocol., 6 weeks
Glioma-associated antigen-specific T-cell response, Glioma-associated antigen-specific T-cell response: determined by IFN-gamma-enzyme linked immune spot (ELISPOT) and tetramer assays, Monitoring will continue as long as subject remains on study.
