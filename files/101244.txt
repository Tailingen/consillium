Nivolumab for Relapsed or Residual Haematological Malignancies After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a prospective study of the safety and efficacy of nivolumab for the treatment of relapsed or residual haematological malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT).

Eligible patients will receive nivolumab at a dose of 3mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate the incidence, severity and treatment responsiveness of GVHD following nivolumab treatment post-alloSCT.
