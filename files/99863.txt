A Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of Bexmarilimab in Combination With Standard of Care in Patients With Hematological Malignancies
This is a study to assess the safety of increasing dose levels of bexmarilimab when combined with standard of care (SoC) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML); Phase 1 aims to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of bexmarilimab based on safety, tolerability and pharmacological activity; Phase 2 will investigate the preliminary efficacy of the combination treatment in selected indications from Phase 1.

This is a multicenter Phase 1/2 open-label, study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of increasing doses of bexmarilimab (FP-1305) in patients with intermediate, high or very high-risk MDS, CMML with 10-19 % marrow blasts, CMML/MDS with failure to hypomethylating agent (HMA), or in patients with newly diagnosed AML non-fit for induction therapy or relapsed/refractory AML. The Phase 1 part of the study will identify a safe and tolerable bexmarilimab dose amongst four predefined dose levels using a bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) dose escalation design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bexmarilimab when administered in combination with SoC.

The Phase 2 of the study is an expansion phase to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of bexmarilimab treatment at RP2D combined with SoC and will follow a Simon's 2-stage design for each of the indications selected to continue forward from Phase 1. This design allows for the investigation of bexmarilimab activity and preliminary response assessments tailored to each indication and allows early stopping in case of futility using a minimum number of patients. Patients from Phase 1, with the selected indication to be investigated in Phase 2, that have been treated at RP2D may be counted towards the number of patients for Phase 2.

Both study phases consist of a screening period, a treatment period, an end of treatment (EoT) as safety follow-up and disease progression/survival follow-up.
