The Expression of Antigens in Bone Marrow Samples From Volunteering Donors.
Antigen expression levels in bone marrow from volunteering donors will be analyzed. The results of this analysis will be used to establish a clinical test to identify cancer patients who could qualify to receive an investigational treatment being developed by GlaxoSmithKline.
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Bone marrow aspiration
Number of copies of Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) antigen expression in bone marrow, Establishment of the range of WT1 transcript levels in a collection of bone marrow samples by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction). Due to the low numbers, they were expressed as \[value x 10E-03\]. Only the samples with gene expression \>0 were presented., At Day 0|Number of copies of PRAME (Preferentially expressed in melanoma)antigen expression in bone marrow, Establishment of the range of PRAME transcript levels in a collection of bone marrow samples by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction). Due to the low numbers, they were expressed as \[value x 10E-03\]. Only the samples with gene expression \>0 were presented., At Day 0
