Sintilimab Combined With Anlotinib Therapy for Initially Unresectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy has been recommended as the standard treatment for locally advanced and unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its efficacy remains to be improved. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been proven to be effective for late-stage NSCLC, and anti-angiogenesis agents have also been used for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Therefore, we designed this single-arm clinical trial, which aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of sintilimab combined with anlotinib therapy for patients with initially unresectable stage II-III NSCLC.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Anlotinib
Surgical conversion rate, The surgical conversion rate was defined as the proportion of subjects with the successful conversion over all subjects who received the tested regime., 18 weeks from the initiation of the tested regime therapy
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have the best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed based on RECIST 1.1., 18 weeks from the initiation of the tested regime therapy|R0 resection rate, R0 resection rate is defined as the complete resection rate of all tumor under microscope., within 28 working days after operation|Major pathological response rate, Major pathological response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a major pathological response (residual tumor â‰¤10%)., within 28 working days after operation|Pathological complete response rate, Pathological complete response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a pathological complete response (residual tumor = 0%)., within 28 working days after operation|Overall survival (OS), OS is measured from the time from the treatment onset (date of first study dose) until the date of death from any cause., 2 years from the initiation of the tested regime therapy|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the time from the treatment onset (date of first study dose) until the date of tumor progression or death from any cause., 2 years from the initiation of the tested regime therapy|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is measured from the time from radical surgery until the date of tumor progression or death from any cause., 2 years from the initiation of the tested regime therapy|Treatment-related adverse events, Incidence and grade of treatment-related adverse events assessed based on CTCAE 5.0, 3 months from the end of the tested regime therapy
Concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, but patients receiving chemoradiotherapy have limited improvement in prognosis and are almost impossible to achieve a radical cure. Considering the excellent effect of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy in NSCLC, we designed this single-arm clinical study, which aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of sintilimab combined with anlotinib therapy for patients with initially unresectable stage II-III NSCLC, in order to enable patients to achieve further surgical treatment and prolonged survival.
