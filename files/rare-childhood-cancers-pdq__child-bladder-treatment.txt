Clinical Presentation and Risk Factors
Urothelial bladder neoplasms are extremely rare in children. The most common presenting symptom of bladder cancer in children is hematuria.[
1
,
2
] Bladder tumors can present throughout the pediatric age range. In one small series, the mean age was 11.9 years (range, 4–19 years).[
3
] In another study, patients were aged between 16 months and 19 years. Most of the bladder tumors occurred in males.[
4
]
Bladder cancer in adolescents may develop as
a result of exposure to alkylating-agent chemotherapy that was given to treat other childhood tumors
or leukemia.[
5
-
8
] The association between cyclophosphamide exposure and bladder
cancer is one of the only established relationships between a specific anticancer drug
and a solid tumor.[
9
] An excess prevalence of bladder tumors has also been observed in survivors of specific cancer types (e.g., heritable retinoblastoma), supporting the concept that genetic factors contribute to the development of subsequent neoplasms.[

Histology
Histological classification of urothelial bladder neoplasms includes the following:
Urothelial papillomas.
Papillary neoplasms of low malignant potential.
Low-grade urothelial carcinomas.
High-grade urothelial carcinomas.
An alternative designation is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The most common
histology is papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, while high-grade, invasive urothelial carcinomas are extremely rare in young patients.[

Treatment and Outcome of Childhood Bladder Cancer
Treatment options for childhood bladder cancer include the following:
Surgery.
In contrast to adult bladder carcinomas, most pediatric tumors are low grade and superficial. Pediatric patients have an excellent prognosis after transurethral resection.[
1
-
4
] In one review of the literature, recurrence risk and mortality rates were low in pediatric patients (8.6% and 3.7%, respectively).[
5
] Most recurrences were observed within 9 months of treatment, and all recurrences occurred within 32 months of treatment. This finding  suggests that patients should be monitored for at least 3 years.
Squamous cell carcinomas and more aggressive carcinomas have been reported in children and may require a more aggressive surgical approach.[

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Childhood Bladder Cancer
Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the
NCI website
. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the
ClinicalTrials.gov website
.
Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[

5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
