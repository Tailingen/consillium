Evaluation of Four Reconstructions After Total Gastrectomy
There are four capital reconstructions after total gastrectomy which is widely used in China. Life quality is the only standard to evaluate postoperative results of different reconstructions. In order to determine the best reconstruction after total gastrectomy, we designed this study to compare life qualities of four reconstructions.
