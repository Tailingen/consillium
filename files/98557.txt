A Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of the Addition of ABT-888 Plus Carboplatin Versus the Addition of Carboplatin to Standard Chemotherapy Versus Standard Chemotherapy in Subjects With Early Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a 3 arm Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of veliparib plus carboplatin versus the addition of carboplatin to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with early stage TNBC.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Veliparib|DRUG: Placebo
Pathological Complete Response (pCR)., Pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast tissue and the lymph node tissue will be assessed upon completion of pre-operative systemic therapy and definitive surgery., At the time of definitive surgery (approximately 24-36 weeks from first dose of study drug).
Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS will be defined as the time from random assignment to documentation of the first of the following events: discontinuation of study therapy due to protocol-defined progression prior to surgery; local, regional, or distant recurrence of breast cancer following curative surgery; a new breast cancer; another new onset malignancy; or death as a result of any cause., Up to 4 years from the date of definitive surgery.|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the number of days from the day the subject is randomized to the date of the subject's death., Up to 4 years from the date of definitive surgery.|Rate of eligibility for breast conservation after therapy (BCR)., Whether a subject is eligible for breast conserving surgery for whom mastectomy was planned at diagnosis will be determined by the subject's surgeon prior to chemotherapy and after completion of chemotherapy., At the time of definitive surgery (approximately 24-36 weeks from first dose of study drug).
