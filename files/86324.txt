Study of LVGN3616 and LVGN6051±LVGN7409 in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel or Bevacizumab and Cyclophosphamide in Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an investigator-initiated industry-supported phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the phase 1 clinic at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who will hold the Investigational New Drug (IND). Lvygen Biopharma will provide as investigational supply LVGN3616, LVGN6051 and LVGN7409 at no cost to the patients on this study. This study will explore antitumor activity of four LVGN3616 and LVGN6051 based regimens in seven selected tumor types:
Metastatic Esophageal|Gastric Cancer|Metastatic Head and Neck Carcinoma|Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Metastatic HPV Related Solid Tumors|Metastatic Ovarian Carcinoma|Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: LVGN3616 + LVGN6051 + Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: LVGN3616 + LVGN6051 + Bevacizumab + Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: LVGN3616 + LVGN6051 + LVGN7409 + Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: LVGN3616 + LVGN6051 + LVGN7409 + Bevacizumab + Cyclophosphamide
To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LVGN3616 and LVGN6051 ± LVGN7409 in combination with nab-paclitaxel or bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide (4 individual regimens).
2. To evaluate antitumor activity of LVGN3616 and LVGN6051 ± LVGN7409 in combination with nab-paclitaxel or bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide (16 specific cohorts according to disease type and regimen).

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess survivals.
* To explore potential baseline biomarkers.
* To explore patient-reported outcomes (PRO).
