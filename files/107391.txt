Study Evaluating Safety Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of AUR112 in Patients With Relapsed Advanced Lymphoma
A Phase 1, Open Label, Dose Escalation, Multicenter, First-in-Human (FIH) Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral AUR112 in Patients with Relapsed Advanced Lymphoma (ADITI-1)
Relapsed Advanced Lymphomas
DRUG: AUR112
First cycle Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)., Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT) taking AUR112, 28 days (Cycle 1)|Safety of AUR112 as measured by the number of participants with treatment related adverse events (AE) graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, The assessment of safety was based on the frequency of deaths, adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE)s leading to discontinuation of study drug, and abnormalities in specific laboratory assessments. AEs and laboratory values will be graded for severity according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, 28 days|To determine the doses to be recommended for evaluation in future studies., Determine selected dose(s) to be studied in future clinical trials, 28 days|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum concentration (Cmax), Maximum concentration of AUR112, [Time Frame: Day 1 and Day 15]|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax in hours, [Time Frame: Day 1 and Day 15]|Pharmacokinetics: Area under the curve (AUC), Area under the curve (AUC) of AUR 112 in h\* mcg/mL, [Time Frame: Day 1 and Day 15]|Pharmacokinetics: Mean Residence Time (MRT), Average time the drugs stays in the body, [Time Frame: Day 1 and Day 15]|Pharmacokinetics: Terminal elimination half-life, Terminal elimination half-life of AUR 112 in hours, [Time Frame: Day 1 and Day 15]|Maximum concentration (Cmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare in fast and fed conditions, [Time Frame: Day 8 and Day 9]|Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare Tmax in fast and fed conditions, [Time Frame: Day 8 and Day 9]|Area under curve (AUC) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare AUC in fast and fed conditions, [Time Frame: Day 8 and Day 9]

The main objective of Part 1 will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug AUR112.

Dose escalation of single agent AUR112 will be conducted in the classic 3+3 design. Safety including Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), PK, and PD will be assessed at each dose. Dose escalation will continue until safety limits are reached or the escalation will stop earlier if PK/PD data suggest that a biologically active dose has reached.

The objective is to determine dose(s) which will be investigated in future trials.
