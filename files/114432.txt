The "Light for the Brain" Study
Cognitive impairment (such as memory problems) due to cancer and its treatment can interfere with quality of life and can linger long after treatment has ended, yet research examining cognitive rehabilitation approaches has produced limited clinical benefit. The proposed study will provide information about systematic light exposure for the treatment of cognitive impairment in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and will investigate how it works. This study would facilitate the development of this potential treatment, giving health care providers and cancer survivors a much-needed tool to help with cancer-related cognitive impairment.

DEVICE: Intervention systematic light exposure|DEVICE: Comparison systematic light exposure
Cognitive Functioning (Neuropsychological Tests), Global composite z-score from baseline to 8 weeks after the intervention based on the HVLT-R; BVMT-R; Psychomotor vigilance task; Trail-making tests A and B; WAIS-IV Coding, Digit Span, Block Design; D-KEFS Color-Word Inhibition, Verbal Fluency; Conners Continuous Performance Test III.

Raw scores at baseline of tests within single domains were averaged and then standardized to z-scores. The mean of the z-scores was calculated, and then this composite z-score was standardized to z-scores. Follow up intervention z-scores were calculated based on differences between raw scores at baseline and raw scores at follow-up time points and divided by the standard deviation of the baseline domain z-score) within each domain, and then averaged to create follow up global composite scores.

A z-score below 0 indicated poorer performance than at baseline and a z-score above 0 indicated better performance than at baseline., Baseline to end-of-intervention to 8 weeks after the intervention
Circadian Activity Rhythms (Actigraphy), F statistic from actigraphy was assessed as a measure of circadian activity rhythm robustness., Baseline to end of intervention to 8 weeks later|Sleep Quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index consists of 19 self-rated items used to calculate sleep quality, Baseline, mid intervention, end of intervention, 8 weeks later|Fatigue (FACIT-fatigue), This is a 13-item measure of fatigue., Baseline, mid-intervention, end of the intervention, 8 weeks later|Depressed Mood (CESD), The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 20-item self-report instrument that measures symptoms of depressed mood over the past week., Baseline, Mid-intervention, End of intervention, 8 weeks later|Neurobehavioral Functioning (Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale), Total raw score for entire scale (minimum = 46, maximum = 230) with a higher score indicating greater neurobehavioral symptomatology., Baseline, mid-intervention, end-of-intervention, 8 weeks later|Quality of Life (FACT-BMT), This 50-item scale is a commonly used and well-validated measure of the functional status of cancer patients who have undergone BMT (SCT)., Baseline, End of intervention, 8 weeks post-intervention|Interleukin-6, Serum cytokine IL-6 in pg/mL, Baseline and end-of-intervention|Pro-inflammatory Cytokine - TNF Alpha, Serum cytokine TNF-Î± in pg/mL, Baseline and end-of-intervention|C-Reactive Protein, C-reactive protein in mg/L, Baseline and end-of-intervention|Self-reported Cognitive Function (Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory), The 33-item Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI) is a reliable and valid measure of perceptions of cognitive functioning (Bell et al., 2013; Chelune et al., 1986). Using a Likert scale from 1 (Almost Always) to 6 (Almost Never), ratings of 1-3 were scored "1" indicating impairment, and ratings from 4 to 6 were scored "0" indicating no impairment. Total impairment was calculated by summing the number of impaired items., Baseline, mid-intervention, end of intervention, 8 weeks after intervention
Treatment Satisfaction (FACT-TS), Range between 0 and 5, with 5 meaning higher treatment satisfaction, During the 4th week of the intervention|Credibility/Expectancy (Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire), Treatment credibility and outcome expectancy were assessed at baseline with the mean of the first 3 items of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. Items are scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 9, and the term "symptoms" was replaced with "thinking, memory and concentration problems." Higher scores represent greater credibility and outcome expectancy., Baseline|Usage of Light Box (Integrated Meter Measurement and Litebook Log), Length of time light box has been used., Throughout intervention period (4 weeks)|Chronotype (Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire), Measure determines chronotype with a lower score indicating an evening type and a higher score indicating a morning type., Baseline
