Bendamustine, Prednisone and Velcade® for First-line Treatment of Patients With Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to improve efficacy of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation by Bendamustin, Bortezomib (Velcade), and Prednisone.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bendamustine, Bortezomib, Prednisone
Overall Response Rate (ORR) of BPV, ORR is defined as PR or better, 2 years
Number and percentage of patients achieving a complete response, Number and percentage of patients achieving a complete response, 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from registration to progression or death whatever comes first, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as time from registration to time of death from any cause., 2 years|Time-to-progression (TTP), TTP defined as time from registration to disease progression. TTP is censored at time of deaths which are not caused by progression., 2 years|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS defined as time from start of CR to relapse or death from any cause whichever comes first. Patients evaluable for DFS are patients in complete Response., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as time from first observation of PR to the time of disease progression., 2 years|Renal response according to IMWG (CRrenal, PRrenal, MRrenal), percent of patients with recovery/improvement of renal function (for patients with impared renal finction at baseline), 2 years|Toxicity (with respect to adverse events of CTCAE grade ≧3 and SAEs), toxicity during study therapy with AE of CTC grade ≧ 3, as well as neuropathy of CTC grade 2, measured by CTC-AE (v4.0)., 2 years|Time to objective Response (TOR), TOR defined as time from registration to achieving an objective response for patients achieving an objective Response., 2 years|Time to treatment failure (TTF), TTF is defined as time from registration to treatment discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, Treatment toxicity, patient preference or death., 2 years
1. Objectives Primary

   -Therapeutic efficacy of BPV regimen for multiple myeloma as evidenced by the overall response defined as partial response (PR) or better

   Secondary
   * to assess overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
   * to determine response duration
   * to investigate improvements of renal function
   * to evaluate safety and toxicity (with respect to adverse events of CTCAE grade ≧3 and SAEs)
   * to analyze the efficacy for genetically defined subgroups of myeloma patients based on iFISH and gene-expression profiling
2. Investigational Medicinal Products Bortezomib Bendamustine both in combination with Prednisone
