Peripheral Neuropathy in Colorectal Cancer Patients Under Adjuvant Chemotherapy With FOLFOX, FLOX or XELOX Regime
Oxaliplatin is a cytotoxic platinum compound and is one of the chemotherapeutic agent used in advanced colorectal cancer. It is used combined with Fluorouracil (5 FU) and Leucovorin. The main and most suffering side effect of oxaliplatin is polyneuropathy. Oxaliplatin-induced polyneuropathy (OIPN) can be acute and/or chronic neurotoxicity.

The early detection of the neurotoxicity and changing the medication dose and/or schedule can prevent its development. It has been used different neurotoxicity scales in grading OIPN. In this study the investigators try to investigate whether the evaluation of the vibrotactile perception VTP, by using a multi frequency tactilometry in a patients hand and foot is a good indicator and superior to the standard of care to detect the underlying OIPN in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with FOLFOX, FLOX or XELOX regime.
Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: VibrosSense MeterÂ®
To evaluate the efficacy of evaluating the vibrotactile sense using a multi frequency tactilometry, in patients hand and foot. This is by assessing the changes in the measurements of a multi frequency tactilometry device in between each two time points., Multi frequency tactilometry device is used., Investigation before cycle 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 6 months after last cycle (cycle 12), if cycle length is 2 weeks. If cycle length is 3 weeks, evaluation before cycle 1, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, and 6 months after last cycle.
To evaluate if Oxaliplatin induced polyneuropathy can be earlier detected by using a multi frequency tactilometry compared with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale (CTCAE)., Multi frequency tactilometry device is used., Investigation before cycle 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and after 6 months after last cycle (cycle 12), if cycle length is 2 weeks. If cycle length is 3 weeks, evaluation before cycle 1, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, and 6 months after last cycle
