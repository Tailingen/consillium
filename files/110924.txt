P53 Gene Combined With Radio- and Chemo-therapy in Treatment of Unresectable Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
The objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and safety of rAd-p53 gene combined with radio- and chemo-therapy vs. radio- and chemo- therapy only in treatment of unresectable, locally advanced head and neck cancer. This is a phase 2, open labeled, and active-controlled study.
Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: rAd-p53|RADIATION: radiation|DRUG: Cisplatin
progression-free survival, Patients will be followed up until progression or death, withdrawal from study, or until data cut-off after 3 years., three years after starting treatment
Adverse events, Adverse events, from starting study treatment until 30 days after the last study treatment|overall survival, Patients will be followed up until death, withdrawal from study, or until data cut-off after 3 years., three years after starting study treatment
To evaluate benefits of rAd-p53) gene therapy combined with radio- and chemo-therapy in treatment of unresectable, locally advanced head and neck cancer, total of 60 patients with above condition will be randomly assigned to two groups: the experiment group (EG) and the control group (CG). The EG received multi-point injections of rAd-p53 into tumor on day 1, 8 and 15 at a dose of 2 Ã— 10\^12 viral particles (VP) in a 21-days cycle. Both EG and CG were given radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 plus paclitaxel 30 mg/m2 IV on day 1, 8 and 15). The patients will be treated until disease progression, withdrawal from study, or untolerated adverse events. study endpoints are efficacy (Progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety variables.
