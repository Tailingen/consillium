CD20-CD19 Compound CAR (cCAR) T Cells for Patients With Relapsed /Refractory B Cell Malignancies
This is a phase I, interventional, single arm, open label, treatment study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD20-CD19 cCAR in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B cell malignancies.

Clinical trials with CD19-directed CARs have achieved unprecedented remission rates as high as 90%. However, recent follow-up studies have shown a substantial portion of treated patients relapsed due to antigen escape. CD20-CD19 cCAR is a compound Chimeric Antigen Receptor (cCAR) immunotherapy with two distinct functional CAR molecules expressed on a T-cell, directed against the surface proteins CD20 and CD19. CD20-CD19 cCAR intends to target the mechanisms of single-CAR relapse, specifically antigen escape.
