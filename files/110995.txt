Adding Lomustine to Chemotherapy in Older Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Allogeneic Transplantation for Patients From 60 to 65 Years Old
A multicenter randomized trial comparing induction therapy (IC: Idarubicin and Cytarabine, 5 + 7) to ICL (the same drugs plus lomustine (CCNU), 200 mg/m2 orally at day 1). Patients in complete remission (CR) will then receive a post-remission schedule with or without lomustine according to randomization. Patients from 60 to 65 years old will be proposed to reduced conditioning allogeneic transplantation after first consolidation.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Lomustine
Overall Survival, 1 year
Complete remission, 1 year|Event-free survival, 1 year|Prognostic factors, 1 year|Quality of Life (QOL), 1 year
* Principal Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of lomustine to increase the overall survival by adding lomustine to induction and post-remission chemotherapy.
* Secondary Objectives:

  * To assess the ability of lomustine to increase the CR rate.
  * To assess the ability of lomustine to increase the event-free survival.
  * To evaluate the toxicity and side-effects of lomustine.
  * To evaluate the feasibility of reduced conditioning allogeneic transplantation \*between 60 and 65 years old.
  * To evaluate prognostic factors.
  * To evaluate QOL in elderly.
* Study design: Parallel
* Study plan:

  * Induction therapy: Patients will be randomized to receive idarubicin (5d) plus cytarabine or the same drugs plus lomustine, the latter given at the dose of 200 mg/m2 orally at day 1.
  * Consolidation therapy: After completing induction treatment, patients who are in complete remission will receive a course of consolidation therapy with idarubicin (3d) and subcutaneous cytarabine.
  * Maintenance therapy: In all patients with persisting CR one month after completing consolidation: six courses of monthly combination chemotherapy (idarubicin (1d) and subcutaneous cytarabine) and then a continuous regimen of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, for 6 months.
  * Allogeneic transplantation: Patients between 60 and 65 years old with a full matched donor will receive after consolidation (if still in CR) an alloBMT with a reduced conditioning regimen of Fludarabine (3d) and TBI (2Gy).
* Number of subjects: 460
