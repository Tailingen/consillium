Optimizing Cellular and Humoral Immunity by Vaccinating With PCV13 Before and After CAR-T Therapy
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether receiving the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) before and after CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy will optimize cellular and humoral immunity to pneumococcus.

This is a phase II, single-institution study to investigate if pneumococcal vaccination before and after CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy elicits cellular and humoral immunity to pneumococcus in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphomas. All the participants will receive the same treatment. Immunoglobulins (IgG) against pneumococcal serotypes not included in the vaccine will be served as an internal control. Treatment includes the same dose (0.5ml) of PCV13 one time prior to apheresis followed by two times after CAR T cell therapy
