TACE Combined With Synchronous Radiofrequency /Microwave Ablation to Treat Large and Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma
It is a prospective and multi-center clinical research in China to compare the efficacy, safety and related impact factors between TACE alone and TACE combined with synchronous multi-point MWA/RFA for large and huge liver cancer.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
PROCEDURE: Thermal Ablation|DRUG: EADM|DRUG: Ultra-fluid lipiodol|OTHER: Gelatin sponge articles
Overall Survival, From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 26 months
Time-to-Disease Progression, TTDP follow-up is done at three months interval after lesions defined as stable with treatment of TACE or ablation combined with synchronous TACE six months after enrollment until lesions are defined as disease progression., From the date of first procedure of TACE or TACE combined with synchronous ablation until the time when the disease progresses from an intermediate to an advanced stage as defined by specific events, assessed up to 26 months|Objective response rate (ORR), The ratio of CR plus PR. The efficacy is defined as complete regression (CR), partial regression (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRESIST), Six months after the date of first procedure of TACE or TACE combined with synchronous ablation.|Progression free survival(PFS), From the date of first procedure of TACE or TACE combined with synchronous ablationto until the time when lesions are defined as disease progression or death by any cause,assessed up to 26 months.|Numbers of TACE and TACE combined with ablation cycles, The times of the subjects undergoing TACE or TACE combined with ablation, From the date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 26 months.|Number of participants with adverse events and severe adverse events in TACE alone and TACE combined with ablation groups, Serious or mild adverse events after treatment, From the date of randomization until the date of follow-up visit (30 days after the procedure of TACE or TACE combined with thermal ablation)
It is an open random prospective phase III clinical trial conducted by Principal Investigator Professor Jian-Hua Wang. Investigators in twenty-five hospitals in China participate in. Patients with unresectable large HCC (\>5cm in diameter) and huge HCC (\>=10cm in diameter) are enrolled. The investigators propose to recruitment 280 patients who are randomly assigned into the combined group (treated with TACE and synchronous ablation) and the control group (treated with TACE alone) according to the proportion of 1:1, which means 140 patients in each group. The criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and the methods of lab tests, imaging modality and treatment procedures are the same.
