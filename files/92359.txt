Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time, in months, from date of randomization to date of the first documentation of definitive disease progression as per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST (the initial progressive disease (PD)) or death due to any cause., Randomization until disease progression, death, or end of study up to 182 weeks
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as patients who are alive at time of analysis, Randomization to death due to any cause, or end of study up to 182 weeks.|Overall Survival (OS) at 1 year, OS is defined as the time from date of Randomization to death due to any cause., Randomization to death due to any cause.at 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Randomization until disease progression, death, or end of study up to 182 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization until disease progression, death, or end of study up to 182 weeks
