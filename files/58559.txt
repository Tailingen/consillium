Concomitant Curcumin Palliative Radiotherapy in Advanced Cervical Cancer Trial
The goal of this clinical trial is to test curcumin as an adjunct treatment in patients with cervical cancer receiving standard-of-care palliative radiation. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Is adding curcumin to standard-of-care palliative radiotherapy of cervical cancer patients feasible? Is conducting this study feasible?
2. Does adding curcumin to standard-of-care palliative radiotherapy of cervical cancer patients improve therapeutic responses?
3. Is adding curcumin to standard-of-care palliative radiotherapy of cervical cancer patients safe?
4. How much curcumin is absorbed into the body and how long will it stay in the body?

Participants will:

i. Take 250 mg curcumin capsules four times per day for 4-6 weeks in addition to the prescribed palliative radiotherapy.

ii. Provide blood and urine samples for laboratory tests. iii. Provide blood samples to measure curcumin levels in their body. iv. Obtain CT-scan to measure their tumor response. v. Complete questioners to measure improvements to their quality of life, if any.

Possible scores range from zero to 100, with a higher scale score indicating a higher response level. As such, high scores on functional and global health status (QoL) scales indicate healthy levels of functioning and high quality of life, respectively. However, a high score on the symptoms scale or item indicates more problems or symptomatology., Baseline, 7-9 weeks|Change from baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (QOL) as assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 at 13-17 weeks, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) measures quality of life in cancer patients by evaluating physical, psychological, and social functions. Possible scores range from zero to 100, with a higher scale score indicating a higher response level. As such, high scores on functional and global health status (QoL) scales indicate healthy levels of functioning and high quality of life, respectively.

Possible scores range from zero to 100 for all scale and single-item measures. While a high score on the functional single-items indicates a high degree of functioning, a high score on the symptom scales or single-items indicates a high level of symptomatology or difficulties., Baseline, 7-9 weeks|Change from baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (QOL) as assessed using EORTC QLQ-CX24 at 13-17 weeks, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cervical Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-CX24) measures quality of life in cervical cancer patients in combination with the QLQ-C30.
