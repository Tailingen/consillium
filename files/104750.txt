Anti-CD19 CAR-T Therapy Combine With HSCT to Treat MRD+ B-cell Malignancies
For micro residual disease (MRD) positive patients who have undergone at least 2 cycles chemotherapies for their CD19+ B-cell malignancies, there would be much more risks for them to receive hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT) than MRD- patients. In order to reduce HSCT-related adverse events for these kind of patients, investigators plan to conduct CAR-T therapies on them first to make them achieve MRD- statuses, and then transfer them to HSCT.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B Cell Lymphoma
GENETIC: Second generation CAR-T cells|PROCEDURE: Hematological stem cell transplantation
Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as \>= Grade 3（NCI CTCAE version 4.03） signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical events that are possibly, likely, or definitely related to study treatment, 200 days from enrollment
Number of participants with an MRD negative complete remission after CAR-T therapy and HSCT, the efficacy of the combination of CAR-T therapy and HSCT will be estimated based on the number of participants who have an MRD negative (flow cytometry) bone marrow aspirate following the treatment, 2 years from enrollment
In order to improve prognoses for MRD+ patients who have undergone at least 2 cycles chemotherapies, patients will receive CAR-T therapy before HSCT, once they achieve MRD- remissions, they will subsequently receive HSCT if there are no contraindications.
