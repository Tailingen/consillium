Combination Therapy With NC-6004 and Gemcitabine in Advanced Solid Tumors or Non-Small Cell Lung, Biliary and Bladder Cancer
In the dose escalation phase (Part 1), this study will determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of NC 6004 in combination with gemcitabine.

In the expansion phase of the study (Part 2), study will evaluate the activity, safety, and tolerability at the RPII dose identified in Part 1 in patients with squamous NSCLC, biliary tract, and bladder cancer.

Determine the RPII Dose of NC-6004 in Combination With Gemcitabine, In the dose-escalation phase of the study (Part 1), to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), MTD, and RPII dose of NC-6004 in combination with gemcitabine, 1 year|Activity of NC-6004 Measured by Progression-free Survival (PFS), In the expansion phase of the study (Part 2), to evaluate the activity of NC-6004 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with first-line Stage IV squamous NSCLC, first-line advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer, and first-line metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer compared with historical control as measured by local investigator/radiologist-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., 1 year

All of the scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A positive value of change from baseline means a better outcome in functional scales and a worse outcome in symptom scales., 1 year
