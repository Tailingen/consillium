Swebcg 91:A RT. Breast Conserving Surgery With or Without Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients
The main goal of the trial was to analyse the value of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery for patients with breast cancer, and to find groups of patients where the treatment could be omitted.
Breast Cancer Early Stage Breast Cancer (Stage 1-3)
RADIATION: postoperative radiotherapy
Loco-regional recurrence, Recurrence in the breast or regional lymph nodes, 35 years
survival, Does radiotherapy have an impact on survival?, 35 years|Secondary malignancies, Does radiotherapy have an impact on secondandary malignancies?, 35 years
The trial recruited patients between 1991-1996, and the primary outcome in terms of recurrences has been updated through the years since then. Tumour material has been collected in order to study prognostic and predictive factors for breast cancer patients that are treated today. Late side effects of the treatment are studied.
