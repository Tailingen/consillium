Effect of Stem Cell Infusion Time on aGVHD in Patients With Hematological Malignancies
To observe the effect of stem cell infusion on the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in patients with malignant hematologic diseases after allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT)
Acute Graft-versus-host Disease
PROCEDURE: Time of stem cell infusion
The incidence of grade III to IV aGVHD, The primary endpoint of the study will be the development of aGVHD in the first 100 days post-transplant. Acute GVHD was graded according to the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium criteria., 100 days
The incidence of grade II to IV aGVHD, The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV aGVHD in the first 100 days post-transplant. aGVHD was graded according to the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium criteria., 100 days|The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at 28 days after transplantation, neutrophil engraftment time was defined as the first of three consecutive days during which the neutrophil count was at least 0.5×10\^9/L., 28 days|The cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 100 days after transplantation, Platelet recovery is defined as independence from platelet transfusion for at least 7 days with a platelet count of more than ≥ 100 × 10\^9/L., 100 days|The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality at 180 days after transplantation, The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality at 180 days after transplantation, 180 days|The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality at 360 days after transplantation, The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality at 360 days after transplantation, 360 days|The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 360 days after transplantation, The severity of chronic GVHD was graded according to the 2014 NIH criteria., 360 days|The probability of GVHD-free, relapse-free survival(GRFS), The composite endpoint of GRFS was defined as the first events occurring after transplantation among Grade III to IV aGVHD, moderate to severe cGVHD, relapse, or death for any reason., 360 days|The probability of disease-free survival(DFS), The DFS was defined as the interval between transplantation and disease recurrence, death or the last follow-up date, whichever occurred first., 360 days|The probability of overall survival(OS), The OS was determined to be the time from the first day of transplantation until death from any cause or the last follow-up date., 360 days
Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication and non-recurrent cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The human biological clock uses recurring environmental cues such as light and food intake to establish 24-hour rhythmic changes in sleep, hormone secretion, metabolism, body temperature, and immune function. Current clinical aGVHD prevention strategies focus on suppression of donor lymphocyte function by drugs or immunomodulatory cells, ignoring the impact of the recipient's own functional changes on the graft. The applicant's previous retrospective cohort study found that the time of stem cell infusion severely affected the incidence of aGVHD and its severity after allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). Due to the lack of prospective clinical trial results on the effect of stem cell infusion time on the occurrence of aGVHD after allo-HSCT in the international arena, as well as the possible influence of multiple confounding factors in the aforementioned single-center retrospective study, the present study intends to randomize patients according to the time of stem cell infusion, and to observe its effect on the incidence of aGVHD, other transplant-related complications, and long-term survival after allo-PBSCT of patients with hematological malignancies.
