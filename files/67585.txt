A Phase II Study Bolstering Outcomes by Optimizing Immunotherapy Strategies With Evolocumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (BOOST-RCC)
To learn if evolocumab and nivolumab can control metastatic and refractory renal cell carcinoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Evolocumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

- To determine the objective response rate (Partial Response (PR) and Complete Response (CR)) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria and immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) criteria of evolocumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) refractory to immunotherapy and/or Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade

To confirm safety of evolocumab and nivolumab in participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) refractory to immunotherapy and/or Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade Detail the primary protocol objectives.

Secondary Objectives:

* To describe the adverse events associated with evolocumab and administered with nivolumab
* To determine the disease control rate (Stable Disease (SD)/PR/CR) based on RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria
* To determine duration of response in patients who achieve response
* To determine progression free survival based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and iRECIST criteria
* To determine 1-year survival rates and overall survival

Exploratory Objectives:

* To evaluate CD3 and CD8 T-cell infiltration and MHC-1 expression of paired tumor biopsies before and after treatment
* To evaluate plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol levels and circulating Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PSCK9) levels at baseline and on treatment
* To evaluate circulating lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets and changes on treatment
* To evaluate circulating tumor cells and changes on treatment
