Development for the Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI) in Ovarian Cancer
* Primary objectives: To develop peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) for ovarian cancer, tubal cancer and primary peritoneal cancer that can represent perioperative intraperitoneal tumor burden objectively
* Secondary objectives: To establish the relationship and find out clinical significance between PCI, tumor location and tumor characteristics
Ovarian Cancer
Devleopment for the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI), 55 months
Patients with primary ovarian cancer

* Informed consent
* Digital photography \& Checking PCI (tumor size, number, and Characteristics)
* Postoperative surveillance(tumor marker, image and physical examination)

  1. Developing the best fitting PCI model to reflect recurrence-free survival and overall survival

     * Selection of items
     * Weighting by items and tumor characteristics
  2. Analysis of prognostic impact of PCI compared to conventional staging system (FIGO stage) for ovarian cancer
