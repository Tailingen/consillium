Novel Oncology Therapies in Combination With Adjuvant Chemo in High-risk MSS-CRC
Columbia 2 is a Phase 2 platform study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard of care (FOLFOX) alone and in combination with novel oncology therapies in adjuvant high-risk microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer
Microsatellite-stable Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Standard of Care - mFOLFOX6|DRUG: E1 - mFOLFOX and durvalumab|DRUG: E2 - mFOLFOX6, durvalumab and oleclumab|DRUG: E3 - mFOLFOX6, durvalumab and monalizumab
ctDNA clearance, ctDNA clearance is defined as the change from ctDNA positive status at baseline to ctDNA negative post baseline (6 months), From the time of first dose to 6 months post treatment
Incidence of adverse events, The secondary endpoint of safety as assessed by the number of subjects with adverse events and serious adverse events, From time of first dose to 90 days post last dose|Disease free survival, From randomization until time of first documented incidence of disease recurrence, secondary cancer, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From time of first dose till end of study (5 years)|Disease free survival at 12 months, Percentage of subject who are disease free at 12 months post first dose of treatment, From time of first dose till end of study (5 years)|overall survival, From randomization until death due to any cause, From time of first dose till end of study (5 years)|Serum conenctration levels of novel agents in combination with mFOLFOX6, Pharmacokinetics of novel agents in combination with FOLFOX, From Day 1 up to 90 days post last dose|Number of subjects with detectable anti-drug antibody (ADA) to novel agents in combination with mFOLFOX6, Immunogenicity of novel agents in combination with mFOLFOX6, From Day 1 up to 90 days post last dose
Columbia 2 is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multicenter, platform study of novel oncology therapies in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer.
