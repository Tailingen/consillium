Parvovirus H-1 (ParvOryx) in Patients With Progressive Primary or Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme.
Investigation on safety, tolerability and efficacy of H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV) in subjects suffering from glioblastoma multiforme.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: H-1PV
Safety and tolerability, Parameters for assessment of safety and tolerability:

* physical/neurological examinations (pathological findings as quality and quantity)
* adverse events (quality and quantity per dose level)
* vital signs, ECG, laboratory parameters (pathological findings as quality and quantity, for laboratory parameters: descriptive statistics)
* viral shedding and viral specific antibodies (quantity depicted over time), Up to 28 days after the first administration of the IMP
Efficacy (treatment response), Parameters for evaluation of efficacy:

* Progression free survival (PFS) based on modified RECIST-criteria depicted as Kaplan-Meier curve
* Overall survival (OS) depicted as Kaplan-Meier curve, Up to 6 months after the first administration of the IMP
Investigation on safety, tolerability and efficacy of H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV) in subjects suffering from glioblastoma multiforme.

H-1PV will primarily be administered either intratumoral or intravenously. Ten days thereafter a complete or a subtotal tumor resection with a subsequent administration of H-1PV into the walls of the resection cavity will be carried out.
