Fusion UltraSound Imaging Of the Thyroid GlaNd With I-124 PET. Evaluation of Nodule Allocation.
Regular thyroid diagnostics versus augmented thyroid work-up with additional I-124 PET/US fusion for metabolic-sonographic nodule allocation in patients with benign thyroid diseases
Thyroid Nodule|Thyroid Diseases|Thyroid Goitre
OTHER: Assessment of already preacquired I-124 PET/US
Metabolic-sonographic nodule allocation, The number of correct assignments of metabolic function of each nodule will be assessed for each group seperately. A three-point scale will be used for evaluation of the nodule's function and the degree of the physicians certainty will be investigated using a four-point scale., 1 year
