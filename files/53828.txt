A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of TOS-358 in Adults With Select Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of TOS-358 in adults with select solid tumors who meet study enrollment criteria. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. what is the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for phase 2?
2. how safe and tolerable is TOS-358 at different dose levels when taken orally once or twice per day?
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck|Urothelial Carcinoma|Endometrial Cancer|HR+/HER2-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: TOS-358
Determine the rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), First 21 days of treatment|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and specific laboratory abnormalities graded according to NCI CTCAE v5, Start of treatment to 30 days after last dose
This study will be conducted in two parts: a dose finding portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TOS-358 administered orally on once a day (QD) and twice daily (BID) schedules, and a dose expansion portion to evaluate safety and tolerability in tumor-specific cohorts administered TOS-358 at the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule.

Adult subjects with histologically confirmed diagnosis of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, urothelial cancer, or endometrial cancer with known PIK3CA mutations or amplifications (as determined at a College of American Pathologists/clinical laboratory improvement amendments \[CAP/CLIA\]-certified or equivalently accredited diagnostic laboratory using a validated test), who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study.

In the dose finding portion of the study, TOS-358 will be evaluated as a single-agent at multiple dose levels administered orally until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until meeting any other reason for discontinuation as specified in the protocol.
