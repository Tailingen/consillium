Antimicrobial Solution or Saline Solution in Maintaining Catheter Patency and Preventing Catheter-Related Blood Infections in Patients With Malignancies
RATIONALE: Antimicrobial solution comprising trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, edetate calcium disodium, and ethanol may help prevent blockages and infections from forming in patients with central venous access catheters or peripheral venous catheters.

PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying an antimicrobial solution or saline solution in maintaining catheter patency and preventing catheter-related blood infections in patients with malignancies.

OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the safety of antimicrobial catheter lock solution comprising trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, edetate calcium disodium (EDTA), and ethanol versus saline solution in patients with malignancies.
* To compare the efficacy of this lock solution versus saline solution in maintaining catheter patency in these patients.
* To demonstrate the superiority of this lock solution in preventing or reducing the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical site and randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive antimicrobial solution into the central or peripheral venous catheter (CVC or PVC) once daily for 90 days. Catheter dwell time is 1-24 hours. The catheter is then flushed through before any drug infusion or blood aspiration.
* Arm II: Patients receive saline solution into the CVC or PVC once daily for 90 days. Catheter dwell time is 1-24 hours. The catheter is then flushed through before any drug infusion or blood aspiration.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 10 days.
