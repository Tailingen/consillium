Retrospective Study of Radio-induced Toxicities in the Treatment of Lung Cancer With Tomotherapy
Lung cancers treated by Tomotherapy represent between 60 and 100 patients per year at the CHR of Metz-Thionville. Some patients were observed to present acute toxicities during treatment such as dysphagia or esophagitis of CTCAE grade \> 2. Beyond well known therapeutic and comorbidities factors, the pathophysiology of these events is largely ruled by a constitutional factor - the enzymatic equipment allowing more or less good repair of the DNA lesions induced by radiotherapy (RT). This equipment is characteristic of each individual, hence the term individual radiosensitivity (IR).The scientific literature is rather poor in data describing the frequency of these toxicities in patients receiving RT for lung cancer.

The objective of this study is to describe the frequency of acute and late toxicities after normofractionated radiotherapy of 66 Gy in 33 fractions in patients with small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, stage 2 or 3.
Lung Cancer
late toxicity of radiotherapy, according to CTCAE v5.0 grading, up to 2 years after tomotherapy treatment
acute toxicity of radiotherapy, according to CTCAE v5.0 grading, 6 months following tomotherapy treatment
