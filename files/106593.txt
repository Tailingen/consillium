Efficacy of Skin Cooling in Reducing Pain Associated With Non-invasive Treatments of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Cutaneous Neurofibromas
This study will evaluate the effectiveness of skin cooling in increasing tolerability of four treatments in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Cutaneous Neurofibromas. These treatments are: a 980nm laser, a 755nm laser, radio-frequency injection, and a Kybella injection. Each patient will have a treatment and a control site..
