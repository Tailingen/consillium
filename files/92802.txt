Reduced Dose Radiotherapy vs Standard Dose Radiotherapy for Early Stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study investigates whether administering reduced dose is non-inferior to standard dose radiotherapy in terms of 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) rate for stage I nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who are sensitive to radiotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Cancinoma (NPC)
RADIATION: Reduced dose radiation|RADIATION: Standard dose radiation
Locoregional relapse-free survival, The time from randomization to either documented local and/or regional relapse or death from any cause,whichever occurred first., 3 year
Progression-free survival, Time from randomisation to any documented local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurr first., 3 year|Overall survival, Time from randomisation to death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 year|Distant metastasis-free survival, Time from randomistion to distant metastasis or death from any cause., 3 year|Incidence rate of adverse events (AEs), Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated. Numbers of patients of treatment-related adverse events(acute toxicity) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0.Numbers of patients of late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme., 3 year|Change of quality of life (QoL) score, QoL scores were assessed for each scale by using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ-Head and Neck module (QLQ-H\&N35) at 61.48Gy radiotherapy, at 1 month after radiotherapy, at 6 month after radiotherapy, and 12 month after radiotherapy.All of the scales and items ranged in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional or global QoL scale represents a relatively high/healthy level of functional or global QoL, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high number of symptoms or problems., 1 year
All the patients receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy. If patients receive CR and EBV DNA undetectable when completing 50.88Gy radiation, they will continue to receive radiotherapy until 61.48Gy, then the patients would be randomised assigned ( 1:1 ) to reduced dose group (observation) or standard dose group (continue to receive radiotherapy until 69.96Gy). Patients with stage IA will receive radiotherapy alone, and patients with stage IB will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. For patients with stage IB, those assigned to reduced dose group will receive a total of 2 cycles cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy, with 100mg/m2 per cycle; those assigned to standard dose group will receive a total of 3 cycles cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy, with 100mg/m2 per cycle. This study investigates whether administering reduced dose is non-inferior to standard dose radiotherapy in terms of 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) rate for stage I nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who are sensitive to radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival.
