Multimodal Assessment of Liver Volume and Function
In liver surgery peroperative assessment och the future liver remnant (FLR) is pivotal in order to avoid posthepatectomy liver failure. To date this is mainly performed by measuring the volume of the FLR. Of course FLR volume acts as a surrogate measure of FLR function and the correlation between volume and function is not always accurate. Several techniques to assess FLR function has been proposed. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) and Dynamic MRI are the two such methods. In this study we compare HBS and MRI, in addition to contrast-enhanced CT and ICG, repeatedly performed before and after right hepatectomy in patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
