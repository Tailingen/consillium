Treatment Strategy for Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
The choice of the best second-line therapy in patients with high LH R/R risk, it is a niche of knowledge not covered at the moment, especially the role of Brentuximab (BV) plus PD-1 blockade and auto-HSCT.

What is the progression-free survival and rate of metabolic responses complete in patients with high-risk R/R HL with the treatment strategy: BV+ PD-1 blockade consolidation with Auto-HSCT and maintenance with BV + PD-blockade

Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma|Relapsed Hodgkin's Disease, Adult
DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin 50 MG [Adcetris]
Progression free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first., 24 months
complete remission, complete absence of any disease assessed by PET after established treatment, 24 months|overall survival, status at last follow-up alive or dead, 24 months
Patientes with Refractory/relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL R/R) with multiple failed therapies represent a therapeutic dilemma. The goal of next-line treatment is long-term disease control with manageable adverse reactions. Given the limited therapeutic options for patients with HL R/R, better therapies should be sought, more effective, with better tolerability, less toxicity, with increased overall survival (OS) of the patients, with the aim of improving outcomes in terms of disease-free survival progression (PFS) of the current standard treatment. Since currently only 50% of the patients with high-risk R/R HL treated with the standard regimen achieve healing. The high effectiveness and low toxicity of immunotherapy with prolonged remission or stabilization of the disease make it a new treatment option promising for HL R/R. Based on the above, a treatment strategy is proposed to rescue base with Brentuximab plus PD-1 blockade followed by autotransplantation and consolidation with Brentuximab plus PD-1 blockade in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma High-Risk Relapse/Refractory Compared to Reported OS and PFS Rates in the literature obtained with standard treatment.
