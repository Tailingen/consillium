Collecting and Studying Blood and Tissue Samples From Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Prostate or Bladder/Urothelial Cancer
This study collects and studies tissue and blood samples from patients with prostate or bladder/urothelial cancer that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the original (primary) tumor or has spread to other parts of the body. Studying samples of blood and tissue samples from patients with prostate or bladder/urothelial cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about new biomarkers, potential drug targets, and resistance developing in response to treatment. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat the cancer.
