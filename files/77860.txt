CEUS vs. AMRI for HCC Detection in Patients With Indeterminate Liver Nodules
The study will be conducted at the following locations:

1. UT Southwestern Medical Center
2. Parkland Health and Hospital System
3. University of Michigan

Investigators will prospectively compare the performance of dynamic contrast enhanced abbreviated MRI (AMRI) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound for early-stage HCC detection in patients with indeterminate liver nodules.

Early HCC Detection, Assess and compare true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of AMRI to CEUS for early-stage HCC detection, as defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Staging system., 5 years

Investigators will prospectively perform both abbreviated MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound in enrolled patients every 3-6 months. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and abbreviated MRI will preferably be done the same day, although will be permitted to be completed within 30 days of each other. Abbreviated MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound will be performed every 3-6 months until HCC development, regression to LR-1 or LR-2 (i.e., definitely or likely benign, respectively), or end of follow-up at 24 months post-enrollment.
