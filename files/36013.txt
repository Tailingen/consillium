A Trial Comparing Yield of Confocal Endomicroscopy Guided Biopsies
We wish to determine whether biopsies obtained with the technique of fluorescence-aided confocal endomicroscopy will detect more patients with specialized columnar epithelium than random biopsies among patients with Barrett's esophagus who are being monitored with endoscopy.
Barrett's Esophagus
OTHER: Fluorescence-aided confocal endomicroscopy guided biopsy.|OTHER: Random four-quadrant biopsies.
Whether specialized columnar epithelium was detected., At biopsy on Day 0.
