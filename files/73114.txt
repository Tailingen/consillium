Motorised Probe Holder Assisting Prostate Biopsies
Study, for the first time in clinical conditions, the potential contribution, in terms of accuracy, of the motorised probe holder during prostate biopsies.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Biopsies using Apollo and UroStation®|PROCEDURE: Biopsies using UroStation® (image fusion)
Distance between virtual and effective biopsy, in the two arms, 8 months
Success rate in locking/releasing the probe combined with success rate in performing a full exploration of the prostate, 8 months|Probe holder positions error between virtual and effective biopsy, 8 months|User satisfaction, * biopsies session duration
* device manageability
* device unwiediness
* contribution of the lock of the probe
* set up, cleaning
* global satisfaction, 2 hours|Safety Evaluation, * number of time the device couldn't be started
* number of times the emergency button was pushed
* number of time the biopsy couldn't entirely be done using the device
* number of time the device protections had to be repositioned, 2 hours
