Study of Osimertinib in Patients with a Lung Cancer with Brain or Leptomeningeal Metastases with EGFR Mutation
Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation is mainly based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR. 1st or 2nd generation inhibitors have been shown to be superior to chemotherapy in terms of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) when used as 1st line treatment.

In case of progression at several metastatic sites, systemic treatment will be considered and will depend on the presence of the TKI resistance mutation, the T790M mutation. In the presence of the T790M mutation, osimertinib is superior to chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival, while in the absence of the T790M mutation, platinum salt chemotherapy is recommended. In case of local progression, treatment of the site in progression by radiotherapy and/or surgery is considered. As these local treatments can cause long-term adverse effects, systemic treatments are increasingly being considered in this indication.

Brain and leptomeningeal metastases are the most frequent isolated site of progression in EGFR mutated patients treated with TKI. The high frequency of isolated cerebral and leptomeningeal progression is a consequence of the lower diffusion of 1st and 2nd generation TKIs in the central nervous system (CNS). Osimertinib is a 3rd generation TKI that has the particularity of overcoming the T790M mutation and having greater brain penetration than 1st or 2nd generation TKIs, which could make it an attractive therapeutic option in the event of brain progression or leptomeningeal progression. However, its efficacy in patients with cerebral or leptomeningeal metastases is still poorly understood.
