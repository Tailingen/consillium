A Study of BL-M07D1 Versus T-DM1 in the Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-positive Breast Cancer With Residual Invasive Cancer After Neoadjuvant Therapy
This trial is a registered phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BL-M07D1 in the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer with residual invasive cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: BL-M07D1|DRUG: T-DM1
Invasive Disease-free Survival (IDFS), IDFS refers to the absence of invasive cancer recurrence after breast cancer treatment., Up to approximately 77 months
Disease-free Survival(DFS), DFS is defined as the time from random occurrence of a tumor to recurrence., Up to approximately 77 months|Distant Recurrence-free Interval (DRFI), DRFI is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first occurrence of distant recurrence of breast cancer or death due to breast cancer., Up to approximately 77 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the subject's randomization date and subject's death., Up to approximately 77 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-M07D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M07D1., Up to approximately 77 months
