Identification of Pathways to Mitigate Immune-Related Adverse Events With Cancer Immunotherapy
This protocol is a prospective, observational study of participants receiving immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors, CPI) for cancer therapy, testing the hypothesis that patients with immune related cutaneous adverse events (ircAEs) have unique immunologic endotypes associated with polarized immune responses.
