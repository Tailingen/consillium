Risk Factors of Complications Regarding Patients Undergoing Brain Tumour Neuro-surgery (Cranioscore).
Patients undergoing a brain tumour neurosurgery with craniotomy may present rare but lifethreatening post-operative complications. There are currently no strong recommendations to help the clinician in an attempt to properly hospitalise these patients after their intervention (Neuro-ICU, ICU,surgical ward).

Determining risk factors of post-operative complications could optimise resources. Therefore hospitalisation in Neuro-ICU would be mandatory in only a little number of patients.
