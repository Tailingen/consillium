Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Stool Output Following Oral Administration of Various Low Volume PEG3350-based Gut Cleansing Solutions Using the Split Dose Intake in Healthy Subjects
This study is to investigate the effect of various modified low volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and ascorbic acid/ascorbate (PEG+ASC)-based gut cleansing solutions on stool output in healthy subjects. In addition, the study is to assess and compare the safety and tolerance of the modified PEG+ASC formulations following oral administration with the safety profile of MOVIPREP®.
