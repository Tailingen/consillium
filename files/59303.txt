Number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), The number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) after starting study therapy. Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 21 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response., Up to 5 years|Number of Patients achieving conversion from PR to CR, Conversion from PR to CR will be assessed by the number of patients achieving an initial PR followed by how many will achieve a subsequent CR by Lugano response criteria.

Partial response (PR) will be calculated by a Deauville score of 4 or 5 with reduced uptake from baseline, and complete response (CR) is defined as a Deauville score of â‰¤ 3., Up to 5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time in years from the start of treatment until disease progression or death, whichever is earlier. Participants who remain alive without progression will be censored at the last documented disease assessment date., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the elapsed time in years from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Alive participants will be censored at the last date known to be alive., Up to 5 years|Number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events (AEs), The number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events (AEs). AEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 42 months|Number of participants experiencing treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs), The number of participants experiencing treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs). SAEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 42 months
