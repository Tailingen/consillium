Phase 2 Study of 9-ING-41 With Chemotherapy in Sarcoma
This is an open label, two-stratum, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine/docetaxel in patients ≥10 years of age with advanced sarcoma. 9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel will lead to sustained disease control and/or increase the rates of objective response in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

Disease Control Rate, To determine the Disease Control Rate (DCR = Complete Response \[CR\] + Partial Response \[PR\] + Stable Disease \[SD\] at 24 weeks) of 9-ING-41 in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel in advanced sarcoma., Approximately 24 weeks
Progression Free Survival, To determine the activity of 9-ING-41 with chemotherapy by assessing progression free survival (PFS)., From start of protocol therapy, approximately 5 years
