A Study of CTX-009 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Adult Patients With Unresectable Advanced, Metastatic or Recurrent Biliary Tract Cancers (COMPANION-002)
This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, phase 2/3 trial of the bispecific antibody CTX-009 plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel in patients with previously treated, unresectable advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancers.
Biliary Tract Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Gall Bladder Cancer|Ampullary Cancer
DRUG: CTX-009|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Best Overall Response, Percentage of patients whose Best Overall Response (BOR) is assessed as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average 6 months
Progression Free Survival, Time from randomization until the date of objective PD (as assessed by RECIST 1.1) or the date of death (by any cause in the absence of disease progression), From randomization to first documented objective PD or death if PD does not occur, average 6 months|Duration of Response, The time between the date of the radiological evaluation that first confirmed CR or PR and the date of the radiation evaluation that first confirmed Progressive Disease (PD), From first confirmed CR or PR to confirmed PD, average 6 months|Overall Survival, Time from randomization until the date of death by any cause. Patients who are still alive at the time of the analysis, or who have become lost to follow-up or withdrawn consent will be censored at their last date known to be alive, From randomization to death from any cause, average 12 months|Disease Control Rate, Percentage of patients whose BOR is assessed as CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD), From randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average 6 months|Safety Profile of CTX-009 in Combination with Paclitaxel, Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and changes in clinical abnormalities for all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (either CTX-009 or paclitaxel), From randomization to 60 days after the last dose of study treatment, average 7 months|Patient Reported Quality of Life, Assessed approximately every 2 months from patient reported data using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and BIL21, From randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average 6 months|Exposure Response by Pharmacokinetic (PK) Sampling, Serum concentrations of CTX-009 at specified timepoints, From C1D1 to treatment discontinuation for any reason, average of 6 months
