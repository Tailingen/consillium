Indocyanine Green (ICG) Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for Pediatric Visceral Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to find out the usefulness and safety of a dye called Indocyanine Green (ICG for short). This dye will be used to help the surgeon find lymph nodes draining solid tumors inside the abdomen that need to be removed. This may also help the surgeon to find if the cancer has moved to other lymph nodes outside of the known area.

Primary Objectives

* To determine the percentage of patients in whom Indocyanine Green (ICG)-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was successful at the time of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for staging of visceral solid tumors.
* To determine the percentage of patients with grade 3 or higher adverse events related to ICG use.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
Percentage of patients in whom Indocyanine Green (ICG)-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was successful, The estimated percentage of ICG identification and its confidence interval (CI) based on the Pearson-Klopper method exact method will be calculated., During surgery (Intraoperatively)|Percentage of patients with grade 3 or higher adverse events related to ICG use, Adverse Events will be captured from the time of ICG administration to 24 hours post-surgery. Adverse Events will be graded by this scale: the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From the time of ICG administration to 24 hours after surgery (post-surgery)
During surgery, participants will be given the dye to help the doctor see the lymph nodes to be removed. Pictures or a video of the procedure will be done. The number of lymph nodes removed will be recorded. After surgery, the lymph nodes will be examined.

Participants will be followed for up to 24 hours after surgery to determine if there were any side effects from the dye.
