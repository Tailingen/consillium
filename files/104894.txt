Financial and Insurance Assistance- Oncology Financial and Legal Navigation Program
The overall objective of this study was to develop and evaluate FINassist (Financial and Insurance Navigation Assistance), a patient-centered, interdisciplinary team-based oncology financial and legal navigation program. The program leverages Medical Legal Partnerships to enhance cost of care conversations with pediatric oncology patients and caregivers. FINassist optimizes the team-based care model by integrating clinicians, social workers, financial navigators, and legal advocates who work in tandem to enhance cost of care conversations with patients and caregivers, identify and intervene on patient socio-legal needs, and advocate for system-level changes.
