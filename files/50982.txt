Feasibility of ERAS Protocol in T4 Colorectal Cancer Patients
Patients diagnosed with T4 colorectal cancer represent a specific subgroup of colorectal patients, frequently composed of fragile patients whose advanced nature of the disease often requires a multi organ resection by an open surgery approach and frequently leads to higher intra/postoperative complication.Those characteristics makes them to be considered less suitable for ERAS protocol, especially regarding an expected difficult compliance to postoperative items.

The impact of enhanced recovery program on postoperative outcomes in this subset of patients has never been addressed in literature, in fact most of studies either excluded T4 patients due to higher rates of complication or adopted an homogeneous patient sampling analizing all stage colorectal cancer together.

Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of ERAS protocol in T4 colorectal patient, primary outcome was to compare postoperative lenght of stay between T4 colorectal patients treated with ERAS protcol and those treated with standard of care.
