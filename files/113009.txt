Clinical Trial of Molecular Biomarkers in Women With Uterine Cervix Cancer
This is a phase 0 clinical trial of molecular biomarkers in women with uterine cervix cancer. Women receive standard-of-care radiochemotherapy followed by brachytherapy. Blood samples are obtained to detect circulating levels of deoxyribonucleotides, human papillomavirus DNA, and circulating tumor cells.
