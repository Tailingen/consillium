A Study of CC-90011 and Comparators in Participants With Prostate Cancer
This is an open-label, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging Proof of Biology (POB) study to determine whether CC -90011 reverses, by the induction of androgen receptor (AR) expression, the castration resistance, due to lineage switch, in participants with mCRPC that have failed enzalutamide as last prior therapy. This study aims to assess whether CC-90011 can induce AR expression and, consequently, re-sensitize tumors to anti-hormonal therapy.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: CC-90011|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Prednisone
Assessment of androgen receptor (AR) level, FDG/FDHT PET imaging will be compared with Screening to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) and from Cycle 1 to Cycle 3 (Cycle 2-3 is combined therapy period) to assess changes in AR expression., From Screening to the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 28 days)
Safety and tolerability assessed by Adverse events (AEs), All AEs will be monitored and recorded from the time the subject signs the ICF until 90 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of study medication. For SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study drug, must be reported. For subjects who have high blood pressure related to abiraterone treatment, blood pressure monitoring every 2 weeks should continue after discontinuation of abiraterone until the blood pressure normalizes or returns to pre-enrollment levels., From the time the subject signs the ICF until 90 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of study medication|Safety and tolerability assessed by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE criteria, version 5.0. An event will be considered a DLT if the event is attributed (definitely, probably or possibly) to study treatment during Cycle 2 (4weeks) consistent with CC-90011 in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, Through study completion, Up to 1.5 years|Assessment of anti-tumor activity, Anti-tumor activity will be assessed based on Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG3) criteria, Through study completion, Up to 3 years
