Walking for Recovery From Surgery in Improving Quality of Life in Older Adults With Lung or Gastrointestinal Cancer and Their Family Caregivers
This pilot clinical trial studies how well Walking for Recovery from Surgery works in improving quality of life in older adults with lung or gastrointestinal cancer and their family caregivers. A walking program, such as Walking for Recovery from Surgery may help support overall well-being as a caregiver, and may help improve family member or friend's recovery from surgery.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine whether the intervention and telehealth approach would be feasible and acceptable.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine patient outcome patterns suggesting the potential efficacy of the intervention on self-efficacy, functional status (daily steps, 6-minute walk time, timed up and go), psychological distress, symptoms, and global health status.

OUTLINE:

Patients and caregivers receive Walking for Recovery from Surgery prehabilitation intervention in 4 sessions 3-7 days before surgery, before discharge, and at 2 and 7 days post-discharge.

After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up for 2 months.
