18F-DCFPyL PET-CT Scan and Prostate Cancer
Primary Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT for initial staging of prostate cancer in Veterans compared to conventional imaging (99mTc-MDP bone scan and Diagnostic CT or MRI). The primary clinical endpoint of our study is the percent of Veterans with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT identifies M1 disease at initial staging.

Secondary Objectives:

Frequency of the change in primary treatment plan after initial staging.
Prostate Cancer Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL
the percent of Veterans with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT identifies M1 disease at initial staging, 120 days
This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial in Veterans with prostate cancer, no prior local therapy, who are at risk of having metastatic disease (PSA greater than 10, or Gleason Score greater than or equal to 4+3, or clinical stage greater than or equal to T2c). Veterans who are planned to undergo or have recently undergone conventional, routine care initial staging scans for prostate cancer (99mTc-MDP or NaF PET bone scan and diagnostic CT or MRI of pelvis) will also receive a 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan. The primary endpoint is the percent of Veterans with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan identifies evidence of M1 disease at initial staging.
