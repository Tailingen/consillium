Optimizing the Preparation Regime Prior to Colonoscopy Procedure With Pure-Vu System
The primary objective of this multicenter, prospective, randomized study is to evaluate the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon who are indicated for a colonoscopy procedure using one of two different reduce bowel preparation regimes.in addition, the cecum intubation rate, time to cecum, total procedure time, and adverse event will be evaluated.

rate of adequate cleansing level, The rate of adequate cleansing level in each colon segment before and after use of Pure-Vu will be evaluated per study arm using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Segment score of 0-3 given to each of the 3 segments of the colon (Left side, Transverse and right side).

BBPS\* scores will be rated by the colonoscopies, on the basis of three segment scores summed for maximum score of 9, where:

* 0 = unprepared
* 9 = completely clean (in completed to Cecum procedures) An adequate cleansing procedure will be considered when all the colon segments will be graded as 2 or above., up to 2 hours
This multicenter, prospective, randomized study will include up to 100 patients (30 patients per site and 15 patients per study arm), aimed at evaluating the performance of Pure-Vu System in cleansing patients' colon who are indicated for colonoscopy procedure using one of two different preparation regimes as detailed below.

Subjects will be enrolled at up to 10 clinical sites in the United States. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to a given study arm and will be required to follow a specific bowel preparation instruction along with a specific prep agent (Bowel preparation instructions for morning and afternoon procedures are provided in appendix B1 and B2, respectively), as per study arm allocation, starting 5 days prior to the colonoscopy with Pure-Vu. Patients will be asked to record and provide their diet and bowel movements in the provided diary log at time of their scheduled colonoscopy (Diary log is provided in appendix D).

In addition patient will be ask to complete a satisfaction questionnaire include feedback on the procedure and on specific aspects related to the preparation regime.

Following the procedure a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (Â± 48 hours) post Pure-Vu procedure to assess patient well-being and capture any adverse events.
