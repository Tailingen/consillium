Study Evaluating SC291 in Subjects With r/r B-cell Malignancies (ARDENT)
SC291-101 is a Phase 1 study to evaluate SC291 safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, cellular kinetics, immunogenicity, and exploratory biomarkers.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: SC291
Evaluate safety and tolerability of SC291, Safety and Tolerability: Proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, 24 months
Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of SC291, Preliminary anti-tumor activity: Proportion of subjects with an objective response (including partial response or complete response), 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC291, Cellular kinetics-related parameters evaluated by CAR T cell copy number, 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC291, Cellular kinetics related peak (Cmax) in peripheral blood, 24 months|Evaluate cellular kinetics and persistence of SC291, Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) in peripheral blood, 24 months|Evaluate host immunogenicity to SC291, Incidence of anti-CD19-directed CAR antibodies, 24 months
This is an open-label, single arm, Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC291 administered intravenously (IV) following a standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in subjects with NHL or CLL who have received two or more prior systemic treatments per standard of care (or after autologous stem cell transplant \[ASCT\] for NHL). This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Phase 1a: dose finding using a 3+3 design in subjects with NHL or CLL. Phase 1b: dose expansion to further evaluate safety and efficacy at the RP2D in subjects with LBCL and CLL.
