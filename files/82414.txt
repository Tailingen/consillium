Pembrolizumab With Locally Delivered Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Metastatic Esophageal Cancers
The investigators propose to treat patients with metastatic esophageal cancers and dysphagia with two fractions of brachytherapy followed by pembrolizumab. The brachytherapy is hypofractionated and will provide a radiation dose of sufficient intensity to induce the release of tumor-derived antigens and trigger an antitumor immune response. The simplicity of the design should maximize the chance to examine the hypothesis that radiotherapy can induce an immune response, which can then be augmented by pembrolizumab treatment. Success in this study would provide the impetus to conduct further trials aimed at developing this unique strategy as a more broadly applicable therapeutic option in the treatment of patients suffering from these deadly cancers, and will provide important mechanistic insights into the relationship between radiation treatment and immune therapy augmentation.

Taken together, these data indicate that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in esophageal cancers in combination with radiation therapy may be a rational treatment strategy for these cancers.
