Neoadjuvant HAIC for Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond Milan Criteria
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of resection plus neoadjuvant hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with resection alone in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: FOLFOX|PROCEDURE: Hepatic resection
Overall survival, Time to death, 60 months
Disease-free survival, Time to recurrence or death, 60 months|Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.0, 30 days
Resection is the long-term therapeutic option for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect and high relapse rate of resection for patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria. Our previous prospective study also revealed that neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) seems to confer a survival benefit for resectable HCC. Recently, the results of our previous prospective study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for HCC with large HCC.Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of resection plus neoadjuvant HAIC over resection alone.
