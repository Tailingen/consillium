A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis in Ambulatory Cancer Participants
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that rivaroxaban is superior to placebo for reducing the risk of the primary composite outcome as defined by objectively confirmed symptomatic lower extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), asymptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), incidental PE, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related death in ambulatory adult participants with various cancer types receiving systemic cancer therapy who are at high risk of developing a VTE.

DRUG: Rivaroxaban|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Participants With Time to First Occurrence of Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Composite and Components), Percentage of participants with time to the first occurrence of primary efficacy endpoint (composite and components) was reported. The primary efficacy composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of objectively confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE, incidental PE, or VTE-related death as adjudicated by an independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC)., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Major Bleeding Events as Defined by International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), Major bleeding is defined as clinically overt bleeding that is associated with a reduction in hemoglobin of 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or more, or a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or occurrence at a critical site defined as intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intra-muscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal, or fatal outcome., From first dose of study drug to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to 32 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Symptomatic VTE Events or VTE-Related Deaths, Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of symptomatic VTE events (symptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, or symptomatic non-fatal PE) or VTE related deaths as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With All-Cause Mortality, Percentage of participants with all-cause mortality as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported. Overall deaths occurred during observation period (defined by start to end date of the observation period \[that is approximately 180 days\] are reported here., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Fatal or Non-fatal Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE), Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of fatal/non-fatal ATE (a composite of occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke \[ischemic infarction with or without hemorrhagic conversion or primary hemorrhagic events - intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma or epidural hematoma\] or any other ATE recorded) event as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Fatal or Non-fatal Visceral VTE, Percentage of participants with time to the first occurrence of fatal or non-fatal visceral VTE as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Composite Efficacy Endpoint 1, Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of composite efficacy endpoint 1 (composite of objectively confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE, incidental PE or all-cause mortality) as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to First Occurrence of Composite Efficacy Endpoint 2, Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of composite efficacy endpoint 2 (composite of objectively confirmed symptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE or VTE-related deaths) as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to First Occurrence of Composite Efficacy Endpoint 3, Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of composite efficacy endpoint 3 (composite of objectively confirmed symptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, asymptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE, incidental PE, VTE-related deaths, fatal/non-fatal ATE \[MI, stroke {ischemic infarction with or without hemorrhagic conversion or primary hemorrhagic events - intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma or epidural hematoma} or any ATE\] or fatal/non-fatal visceral VTE) as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to First Occurrence of Composite Efficacy Endpoint 4, Percentage of participants with time to first occurrence of composite efficacy endpoint 4 (composite of objectively confirmed symptomatic lower extremity proximal DVT, symptomatic lower extremity distal DVT, symptomatic upper extremity DVT, symptomatic non-fatal PE, VTE-related deaths or major bleeding events up to Day 180) as adjudicated by an independent blinded CEC up-to-Day 180 observation period was reported., Up to Day 180|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding, Percentage of participants with time to the first occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding was reported. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, or unscheduled contact with a physician, or temporary cessation of study treatment, or discomfort such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life., From first dose of study drug to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to 32 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Minor Bleeding, Percentage of participants with time to the first occurrence of minor bleeding was reported. Minor bleeding (that is, minimal bleeding) is defined as overt bleeding episodes not meeting the criteria for major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event., From first dose of study drug to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to 32 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Time to the First Occurrence of Any Bleeding, Percentage of participants with time to the first occurrence of any bleeding event was reported. Any bleeding is defined as a composite of major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, or minor bleeding., From first dose of study drug to 2 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to 32 weeks)
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with placebo for primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in ambulatory adult participants, with various cancer types who are scheduled to initiate systemic cancer therapy. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase (14 Days), double-blind treatment Phase (180 Days) and follow up Phase (30 Days). The duration of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 32 weeks.
