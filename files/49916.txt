Increasing Knowledge of Alcohol as a Risk Factor for Breast Cancer Among Women Attending Breast Screening Services
Alcohol is a major modifiable risk factor for breast cancer in women, yet this is not widely understood by health practitioners or policy makers, let alone the general population. The investigators aim to test the effects of a targeted alcohol and lifestyle brief intervention for women attending breast screening services, to improve knowledge of alcohol as a risk factor for breast cancer and reduce harmful alcohol use.
