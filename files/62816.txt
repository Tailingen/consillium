Physical Activity Intervention in African American Men After Radical Prostatectomy
The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting African American prostate cancer survivors to a 12 week physical activity intervention study of three arms (aerobics, resistance training, and usual care) through physician referral and community advertisement strategies. In addition, the investigators will investigate the acceptance rate of the intervention and gather preliminary results on the effect of exercise on African American men's urinary and sexual functions. These data can then be used to refine the intervention and its implementation model, and to inform the submission of a larger grant to the National Institutes of Health.

Recruitment rate comparisons between physician referral and community advertisement, Completion of study (approximately 3.5 years)|Attrition rate in each arm, * Evaluate percentage of finished duration of walking in each session and percentage of total finished session in the aerobic exercise arm.
* Evaluate the percentage of attended sessions in the resistance training arm, Completion of study (approximately 3.5 years)|Intervention effectiveness as measured by change in accelerometer measured physical activity, Completion of study (approximately 3.5 years)|Intervention effectiveness as measured by change in self-reported urinary/sexual function as measured by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), -Intervention effectiveness will be compared between the three arms by comparing the change in self-reported urinary and sexual function. Mixed effects regression will be used to account for the longitudinal design., Completion of study (approximately 3.5 years)
