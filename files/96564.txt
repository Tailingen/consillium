Trans and Non-binary Prostate-Specific Antigen Reference Interval Determination Study
The prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test can help diagnose prostate problems, including cancer.

The prostate is an organ in the pelvis. It is found in cisgender men, transgender (trans) women and some non-binary people.

Anyone with a prostate can get prostate cancer. The prostate remains after genital (lower) surgery. The hormones and surgeries that trans women and non-binary people might have can lower the PSA. We do not have good data on the normal PSA levels are for this group

TransPRIDE is a research study that will help us find the normal levels of PSA in trans women and non-binary people with prostates.

Researchers will ask 500 trans women and non-binary people with prostates to take part. They will need to be aged 40 or over. They will need to be on hormones or have had lower surgery. They will be called after 6 months to recheck their health. If a person has a high PSA, they may be sent for more tests.

Knowing the normal PSA level for trans women and non-binary people will help doctors to find and treat their prostate cancer more quickly.
Prostate CA
The primary endpoint is blood PSA concentration., The 95th percentile will be used to define the upper reference value of PSA values in healthy individuals; this will be estimated separately for each age group (i.e. 40-49, 50-59, 60-79, 70+)., 6months following end of enrolment
Prostate Cancer, The numbers of participants diagnosed with prostate cancer during the study., 6months following end of enrolment
