PRostate Cancer Individual Signature Evaluation Trial in Patients Undergoing Scheduled Prostate Biopsy
The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a blood-based diagnostic test that will predict prostate biopsy outcome as positive or negative for prostate cancer. Such a test will serve to reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.
