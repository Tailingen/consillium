Study on SBRT for Inoperable Lung and Liver Oligometastases From Breast Cancer
Investigators designed a phase II study to evaluate safety and efficacy of lung and liver stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in oligometastatic breast cancer patients unsuitable for surgery, using VMAT RapidArc approach.

Investigators designed a prospective phase II study to evaluate safety and efficacy of lung and liver stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) scheduled for oligometastatic breast cancer patients unsuitable for surgery with age major than 18 years old and with adequate performance status (ECOG), using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of this technique is the ability to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumour's target while reducing doses to normal tissue, optimizing the therapeutic window.
