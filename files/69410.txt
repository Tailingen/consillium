Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Versus Conventional Protocol After Laparoscopic Gastrectomy
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have been introduced with purposes of reducing the surgical stress response and obtaining optimal recovery after surgery.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: ERAS perioperative cares|PROCEDURE: Conventional perioperative cares
Recovering Rate, 1. Tolerance of diet for 24 hours A. Able to eat one third of more of soft-blend meal without abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, or vomiting
2. Analgesic-free (oral or IV analgesic drugs not necessary after cessation of PCA)
3. Safe ambulation (ambulation of 600m without assistance)
4. Afebrile status without major complications (fever defined as body temperature greater than 37.5)

   * Above total 4 criteria should be satisfied for the evaluation of complete recovery., 4 days after surgery
Postoperative length of hospital stay, up to 4 weeks after surgery|Time to tolerance of a full diet, up to 1 month after surgery|Time to first bowel motion Time to first bowel motion, up to 7 days after surgery|Complications during the admissionTime to first bowel motion, up to 30 days after surgery|Readmission rate, up to 30 days after surgery|Pain scores based on a visual analog scale the day of surgery and the subsequent 3 days, postoperative 2hours, 6 hours, 1 days, 2 days, 3 days, up to 3 days after surgery|Quality of life, European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) and gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) questionnaire on postoperative 5 days, 1 month, up to 1 month after surgery
There is strong evidence of the usefulness of the ERAS programs in patients undergoing colorectal surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter length of hospital stay, compared to the patients of conventional treatment.

However, few studies exist about the implication of ERAS programs in the laparoscopic gastrectomy.

The aim of this study was to compare the recovery rate, morbidity, and quality of life in the patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer, receiving either ERAS protocol or conventional postoperative cares.
