Multi-center Observational Study on the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Anti-PD-1 mAb Treated Tumor Patients by Artery Ultrasound Follow-up
Multi-center Observational Study on the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Anti-PD-1 mAb Treated Tumor Patients by Artery Ultrasound Follow-up
Plaque, Atherosclerotic|Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Inhibitor
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor
Sizes of plaque areas at the same locations on artery ultrasound, Comparison of the sizes of plaque areas at the same locations on artery ultrasound before and after anti-PD-1 mAbs treatments., at least of 3 months after the first dosage of anti-PD-1 mAbs
This is a self-control, multi-center observational study. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 mAbs on atherosclerotic plaques in those anti-PD-1 mAbs treated patients. The method for quantification and evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques are based on the calculation of the plaque area of atherosclerotic plaques on the long axis direction of artery on the ultrasound images. By comparing the plaque areas at the same location of artery in each patient before and after anti-PD-1 mAbs treatments, to assess the progression of atherosclerotic plaques response to anti-PD-1 mAbs.
