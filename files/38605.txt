A Study Evaluating The Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Combinations in Patients With Surgically Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized platform study to evaluate neoadjuvant immunotherapy combinations in participants with resectable HCC. The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new agents become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the participant population.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Tobemstomig
Major Pathologic Response (MPR) Rate, MPR rate is defined as the proportion of participants with =\<10% residual viable tumor in the tumor bed at the time of surgery, as assessed by central pathological review., At the time of surgery
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, pCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants with an absence of residual tumor at the time of surgery, as assessed by central pathological review., At the time of surgery|Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from surgery to the first documented recurrence of disease (intrahepatic or extrahepatic) according to EASL and/or RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause., Surgery to the first documented recurrence of disease (up to approximately 2 years)|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events (whichever occurs first): disease progression that precludes surgery, as assessed by the investigator according RECIST v1.1; local regional, or distant disease recurrence as measured by EASL and/or RECIST v1.1; or death from any cause., Randomization up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|OS Rate at 24 Months, OS rate at 24 months is defined as the proportion of participants who have not experience death from any cause at 24 months after randomization., Randomization up to 24 months|OS Rate at 36 Months, OS rate at 36 months is defined as the proportion of participants who have not experience death from any cause at 36 months after randomization., Randomization up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a radiographic Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) prior to surgery, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST. Responses will be assessed and determined according to RECIST v1.1 and HCC mRECIST but are not required to be confirmed by subsequent imaging assessments., Prior to surgery|Proportion of Participants Downstaged to Within Milan Criteria, Proportion of participants downstaged to within Milan criteria (for participants beyond criteria at randomization). Within Milan criteria is defined as single tumor \<= 5 cm or 2 - 3 nodules all \<= 3 cm., Prior to surgery|R0 Resection Rate, R0 resection rate (proportion of resected participants obtaining an R0 resection). R0 resection is defined as a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no tumor (gross or microscopic) remains in the primary tumor bed., At the time of surgery|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Up to approximately 3 years after first participant enrolled|Proportion of Participants With Delayed or Canceled Surgery Due to Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Proportion of participants with delayed or canceled surgery due to treatment-related adverse events (defined as \> 28 days from surgical restaging visit)., >28 days from surgical restaging visit, anticipated up to 56 days|Post-Operative Surgical Complication Rates According to The Clavien-Dindo Surgical Classification, Post-operative surgical complication rates according to the Clavien-Dindo surgical classification. Clinically relevant complications are defined as Clavien-Dindo Grade \>= IIIa., Surgery to treatment completion/discontinuation (up to approximately 2 years)|Post-Operative Mortality, Post-operative mortality is defined as death within 90 days after surgery, Within 90 days after surgery
