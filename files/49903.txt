Gamma-secretase/Notch Signalling Pathway Inhibitor RO4929097 in Combination With Cisplatin, Vinblastine, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Melanoma
This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 when given together with cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of daily RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered orally daily in combination with CVT (starting dose: cisplatin 25 mg/m\^2 intravenous \[IV\] daily x 3; vinblastine 1.2 mg/m\^2 IV daily x 3, and temozolomide \[TMZ\] 150 mg/m\^2 orally \[PO\] daily x 5) administered on an every 21 day schedule. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097 with CVT in patients with metastatic melanoma with correlative biomarkers for Notch pathway signaling and gamma secretase enzyme activity. (Phase Ib) III. Based on the MTD from the phase Ib study, to conduct a phase II trial and to determine the response rate and overall survival. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of RO4929097 and temozolomide. (Phase Ib) II. To obtain tissue biopsy for correlative studies before the initiation of therapy and one week after treatment with RO4929097 and CVT. (Phase Ib and II) III. To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated at the phase II dose. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is phase I dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and vinblastine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3, and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progressive disease continue to receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and temozolomide as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 24 months.
