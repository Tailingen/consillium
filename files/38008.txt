Study of Olaparib Plus Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy Plus Pembrolizumab After Induction With First-Line Chemotherapy Plus Pembrolizumab in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (MK-7339-009/KEYLYNK-009)
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of olaparib (MK-7339) plus pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab after induction with first-line chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary hypotheses are:

1. Olaparib plus pembrolizumab is superior to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to progression-free survival (PFS).
2. Olaparib plus pembrolizumab is superior to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab with respect to overall survival (OS).

As of Amendment 3, study enrollment was discontinued. Participants who were receiving benefit from the study intervention could continue treatment until criteria for discontinuation are met. Participants who are on study treatment or in follow-up phase will no longer have tumor response assessments by BICR.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. PFS is reported based on the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 29 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up.
