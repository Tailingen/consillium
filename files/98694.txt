White Wine or Nutritional Supplement in Improving Appetite in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: It is not yet know whether white wine is more effective than a nutritional supplement in improving appetite.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying white wine to see how well it works compared with a nutritional supplement in improving appetite in patients with cancer
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
OTHER: therapeutic nutritional supplementation|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: white wine|OTHER: questionnaire administration
Difference in the percentage of patients who report an improvement in their appetite over the intervention period, First 3 weeks
Differences in the percentage of patients who manifest weight stability, defined as weight gain of at least 5% of baseline, At one month|Overall survival, Every 6 months for 2 years|Incidence of study intervention-related toxicity, Prior to registration and at week 3-4|Patient-reported quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) appetite scale, Prior to study intervention and then weekly
OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare white wine (Arm A) to non-wine nutritional supplement (Arm B) for the treatment of cancer-associated anorexia.

II. To evaluate the side effect profile of white wine (Arm A).

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to primary malignant disease (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other \[specify\]), severity of weight loss (excluding peri-operative weight loss) within the past 2 months (\< 4.6 kg \[\< 10 lbs\] vs \>= 4.6 kg \[\>= 10 lbs\]), age (\< 50 years vs \>= 50 years), and planned concurrent chemotherapy or radiation (yes vs no).

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients consume white wine with =\< 15% alcohol content twice daily for 3-4 weeks.

ARM B: Patients receive an oral non-wine nutritional supplement (e.g., Boost or Ensure) twice daily for 3-4 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
