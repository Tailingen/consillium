Anti-PD-1 and Chemotherapy for R/R Hodgkin Lymphoma
Anti-PD-1 therapy provides high response rates in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients who have relapsed or are refractory (R/R) to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and brentuximab vedotin (BV), but median progression free survival (PFS) is only one year. The efficacy of treatment following anti-PD-1 is not well known.

In this context, the optimal treatment for patients who failed after anti-PD-1 therapy is an issue. To better assess their outcome, the investigators retrospectively analyzed the characteristics and outcome of patients from 14 LYSA (The Lymphoma Study Association) centers who lost response to anti-PD-1 therapy and received additional CT.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Evaluate the improvement in response from the end of anti-PD-1 monotherapy
Overall response rate after re-exposure to chemotherapy, Patient evaluation was timed by treating physicians according to the policy of each center, and all patients were evaluated after a median of 10 weeks (min 7 weeks, max 12 weeks) with PET/CT using Lugano criteria, 10 weeks
Best response obtained (Group 1), the best response obtained with CT after anti-PD-1, 10 weeks|Best response obtained (Group 2), the best response obtained with CT after the combination anti-PD-1 and CT, 10 weeks|The toxicities experienced during CT or anti-PD-1 plus CT combination, The toxicities were graded retrospectively according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs (version 4.0)., 10 weeks|Outcomes including PFS, PFS was defined as the time from first relapse, or progression, to the next event (defined as either second relapse/progression, change of therapy, or death from any cause), up to 12 months|Outcomes including overall survival (OS)., OS was defined as the time from first relapse, or progression, to death from any cause., up to 24 months
