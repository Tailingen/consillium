General Practitioners and Participation Rate in ColoRectal Cancer Screening
Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality in France. However this cancer is preventable in the majority of cases by early detection of adenomas.

In France, there is organized colorectal cancer screening, which relies on general practitioners (GPs). Tests delivered by GPs are performed in 89% of cases. However, GPs do not systematically offer the test, for time management and communication reasons. Patients expect their GPs to offer the test and to focus on their expectations. A previous study conducted on GPs showed that training in communication and motivational interviewing increases the number of tests performed by 12.2%.

In order to facilitate the promotion of screening, the investigators would like to develop a training programme for GPs focusing on the application of Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques to the promotion of colorectal cancer screening.

Motivational Interviewing is a directive, client-centered counseling style for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence.

This study is a multicenter trial in general medicine. In this randomized trial the 902 subjects will be included prospectively by the general practitioners (GP) participating in the study.

As a first step, general practitioners who have never participated in Motivational Interviewing training will be recruited and split into 2 groups by randomization, an intervention group and a control group. The interventional group will then undergo a 3 times 2-day training in Motivational Interviewing.

In a second step, the patients will be included by those GP and a self-questionnaire will be send at the inclusion and after 6, 12 and 24 months. The evaluation of the number of tests performed and the analyse of the Health Belief Model (HBM) self-questionnaire will be carried out.

At 24 months, there will be an evaluation of the denial motivation questionnaire for patients who have not participated in organized colorectal cancer screening.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Interaction between patient and trained general practitioners in motivational interviewing
Rate of organised colorectal cancer screening at 24 months, The impact of training general practitioners in motivational interviewing on the rate of organised colorectal cancer screening will be assessed by determining whether or not the immunological test proposed as part of organised colorectal cancer screening at 24 months will be carried out., 24 months
Rate of organised colorectal cancer screening at 12 months, Whether or not to perform the proposed immunological test as part of organized colorectal cancer screening at 12 months., 12 months|Changes in perceptions of colorectal cancer screening, Changes in perceptions of colorectal cancer screening will be assessed using a Health Belief Model (HBM). The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a social psychological health behavior change model developed to explain and predict health-related behaviors, particularly in regard to the uptake of health services.

This Health Belief Model use for this study evaluate : individual perceptions (perceived susceptibility and severity), modifying factors (perceived threat and cues to action) and likelihood of action (perceived benefit and perception barriers and taking health action) at Day 0, Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24., Day 0, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Evolution of the self-assessment of life expectancy, Patients will answer a question to find out their self-assessment of life expectancy., Day 0, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Identification of denial of the colorectal cancer screening, Understand why patients refuse colorectal cancer screening of by identificating et quantificating reasons why the patient did not realised the colorectal cancer screening at 24 months of follow up., 24 months
