TAK-659 and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of TAK-659 and paclitaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. TAK-659 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving TAK-659 and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: Mivavotinib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Pharmacokinetic Study
To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of TAK-659 and paclitaxel, This is a dose-escalation study of mivavotinib and paclitaxel, Up to 4 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of mivavotinib (TAK-659) and paclitaxel.

II. To define the safety profiles of the combination.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the combination. II. To analyze pharmacokinetic interactions between TAK-659 and paclitaxel. III. To assess predictive biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by comparing molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have achieved objective responses.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mivavotinib and paclitaxel.

Patients receive mivavotinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
