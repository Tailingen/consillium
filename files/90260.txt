18F-PD-L1 PET/CT in Nivolumab Treated Patients With NSCLC
A multicenter single arm biomarker exploration and validation study. Eighty patients with NSCLC that are eligible for first line chemo-immunotherapy, first line nivolumab/ipilimumab or 2nd line and beyond PD-(L)1 immunotherapy monotherapy according to EMA label and national guidelines will be enrolled in this trial. All subjects will undergo a whole body 18F-PD-L1 PET/CT scan before start of nivolumab containing treatment. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, withdrawal of patient consent or unacceptable toxicity.
NSCLC Stage IV
OTHER: 18F-PD-L1
Progression Free Survival of >= 9 months, The outcome measures of 18F-PD-L1 PET/CT related to the progression-free survival at 9 months according to RECIST 1.1, From date of registration until the date of progression-free survival >= 9 months (according to RECIST1.1)
Progression Free Survival, The outcome measures of 18F-PD-L1 PET/CT related to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined by modified RECIST, or death due to any cause, From date of registration until the date of first documented progression assessed up to 5 months|Overall Survival, The outcome measures of 18F-PD-L1 PET/CT related to the date of death due to any cause, From date of registration until the date of death assessed up to 12 months|Tumor and stromal PD-L1 IHC., Correlation between PD-L1 expression measured by 18F-PD-L1 PET/CT and PD-L1 expression measured by IHC, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
18F-PD-L1 PET/CT scan to predict durable reponse to nivolumab containing treatment in patients with NSCLC
