A Study Evaluating Safety and Therapeutic Activity of ANV419 in Patients with Advanced Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of ANV419 (single agent) and in combination with ipilimumab in patients with relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumors.

The purpose of this First-in-Human, open-label, dose escalation study is to assess the initial safety and efficacy profile of ANV419 intravenous infusion alone and in combination with ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours. It will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANV419 alone and in combination with ipilimumab and, the safest and best dose of ANV419 when used alone or in combination.
