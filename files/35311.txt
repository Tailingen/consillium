DECT in Imaging Patients With Solid Organ Cancer With Intracranial Metastasis
This trial studies how well dual energy computed tomography (DECT) works in imaging patients with solid organ cancer that has spread to the brain. Imaging techniques, such as DECT, may help find and diagnose tumor cells and find out how far the tumor cells have spread in the brain.

PROCEDURE: Dual-Energy Computed Tomography
Best diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) reconstruction parameters, A repeated-measures analysis of variance with the Dunnett post hoc test will be used to determine the significance of the differences in the signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) measurements at the optimal parameter setting, compared with all other parameter settings., Up to 2 years|Accuracy of CT, A Bland-Altman analysis will be used to show the agreement of number of lesions between optimal parametrized CT and the one of standard of care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To optimize two major parameters of computed tomography (CT) imaging for optimal detection of intracranial metastatic lesions.

Ia. Virtual monochromatic image reconstruction. Ib. Contrast bolus timing. II. To measure the detection accuracy of CT compared to the diagnostic standard of care gadolinium-based "Gamma Knife (GK)" protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

OUTLINE:

Within 7 days before the standard Gamma Knife MRI, patients undergo DECT scan over 6 seconds at 1.5, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after receiving the contrast agent.
