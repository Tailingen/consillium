De-escalated Conformal Radiation Expedited Sequentially With Chemotherapy for Endometrial Cancer
The goal of this study is to evaluate short course radiation in the post-operative female pelvis after hysterectomy in stage III-IVA endometrial adenocarcinoma patients, or any stage patients with uterine serous or carcinosarcoma histology. The investigators hypothesize that short course pelvic radiation will have an acute and late grade 3-4 toxicity rate \< 10%, and patients will benefit from both convenient and effective loco-regional control comparable to the traditional 5-6 weeks of radiation.
Endometrial Cancer
RADIATION: Intensity modulated radiation therapy
Incidence of acute hematologic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary adverse events, From start of radiation through Day 90|Incidence of late hematologic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary adverse events, From Day 91 through month 12
Change in patient-reported urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity as measured by PRO-CTCAE, * PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4 with 0=Never/Not at all/None and 4=Frequently/Very Much/Very Severe/Almost Constantly
* Scores for each attribute (frequency, severity and/or interference) will be presented descriptively, Baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months post-completion of radiation|Change in patient-reported urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity as measured by bowel/bladder domains of EPIC-26, * Bladder has 7 questions and bowel has 9 questions
* The response for each item is standardized to a 0 to 100 scale
* The standardized values will be averaged for all items within a group to create the summary or subscale score., Baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-completion of radiation|Change in quality of life as measured by FACT-En, * Questionnaire asking questions about physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and other additional concerns. Answers range from 0 = not at all to 4 = very much. Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state,
* Scoring is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores., Baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-completion of radiation|Locoregional control, -Locoregional recurrence is defined as histologic or radiographic evidence of cancer in the previously resected site or regional lymph nodes included in the radiated field., Up to 12 months post-completion of radiation|Distant control, -Distant recurrence is defined as histologic or radiographic evidence of cancer outside of the radiated field., Up to 12 months post-completion of radiation|Disease-free survival, -Disease-free survival is defined as survival with no evidence of disease recurrence or death, Up to 12 months post-completion of radiation|Overall survival, -Number of participants alive at the time of completion of follow-up, Up to 12 months post-completion of radiation
