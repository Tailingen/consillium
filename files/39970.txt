Ultrasound Targeting for the Lumpectomy Cavity
Accurate targeting of treatment sites should increase local control by radiation therapy for breast-cancer lumpectomy patients. Currently, ultrasound localization is used for prostate cancer patients to locate the prostate before daily radiation treatments. There is now documented evidence that the lumpectomy site does change during the external radiation therapy. Thus, treatment efficacy should be increased by localizing the target, monitoring volume changes, and adjusting the radiation target prior to the boost radiation dose.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Ultrasound
Determine the volume change in lumpectomy cavity during the course of external beam radiation prior to delivery of the radiation boost., 7 weeks
Determine by daily ultrasound if targeting of the CT-based boost field is inaccurate due to daily variation of subject position., 7 weeks
Study participants will have weekly ultrasounds performed of the lumpectomy cavity to determine shift and volume changed from the initial treatment-planning CT to the time of the radiation boost (approximately 4 weeks). These ultrasounds are done prior to their weekly doctor's appointment with Radiation Oncology.

When it is time to perform the radiation boost (when the radiation is more targeted to the lumpectomy cavity), the ultrasound will be done daily with the participant in treatment position. The SonArray system used for the ultrasound-driven targeting for prostate cancer will be utilized. If the lumpectomy cavity is observed, the ultrasound suggested shifts will be noted and compared to the shifts needed for standard clinical set up.

Once the subject has completed radiation therapy, the study participation is complete.
