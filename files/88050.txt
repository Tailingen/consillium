A Study of Multiple Doses of RO7247669 in Participants With Previously Untreated Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of two dose levels of RO7247669 in participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to select the recommended dose for further development.
