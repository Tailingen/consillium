Comparison of 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET and 18F-FDG PET in Lung Cancer
This is a prospective, single-center, single arm, open label study to evaluate the performance of 68Ga-FAPI-46 for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions of lung cancer with comparison to 18F-FDG PET.
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-FAPI-46
To define the diagnostic performance 68Ga-FAPI PET, To evaluate the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of the 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET scan for identification and staging of lung cancer with comparison to 18F-FDG PET. Histopathology and clinical follow-up will be used as truth standard., Through study completion, 2 years
To determine the safety profile of 68Ga-FAPI PET, Number of participants with 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET scan related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 7 days post injection with 68Ga-FAPI-46
FDG-PET imaging is recommended by clinical guidelines for staging of lung cancer; however, there are still limitations of FDG-PET in lung cancer staging due to false-positive and false-negative findings. 68Ga-FAPI PET images have shown high diagnostic performance with high tumor-to-background ratio in various cancers. The purpose of this study is head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET and 18F-FDG PET for the diagnosis and staging or re-staging of lung cancer.
