The Efficacy and Safety of Drug Loaded Microsphere Bronchial Artery Chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) Combined With Anlotinib and Adebelimumab in the Third Line Treatment of Advanced NSCLC: a Prospective, Single Arm, Single Center, Exploratory Clinical Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about Drug loaded microspheres for bronchial artery chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) combined with anlotinib and adebelimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC after second-line treatment.

The main question it aims to answer is:

The efficacy and safety of Drug Loading Beads Bronchial Arterial Chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) combined with Anlotinib and Adebelimumab in the third line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

Participants will receive DEB-BACE treatment, rest for 1 week and then undergo 1 cycle of treatment with combination of Anlotinib and Adebelimumab. With a maximum of 4 DEB-BACE treatments depending on the therapeutic effect, followed by continued treatment with Anlotinib and Adebelimumab.
