A Study of Azidothymidine (AZT) in the Treatment of HIV Infection in Patients Receiving a Bone Marrow Transplant
To determine whether zidovudine (AZT) in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation prevents the reinfection of donor hematopoietic/lymphoid cells in patients with positive HTLV III antibody and large cell/diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Patients who are candidates will be evaluated for HTLV III activity and drug levels.
