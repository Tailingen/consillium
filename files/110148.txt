Registry of Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Adult With Hematologic Disease
The goal of this observational study is to register hematologic patients with haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploHSCT). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* 1-year progression free survival rate
* 1-year overall survival rate
* Graft-versus-host free relapsed free survival at 30-day, 100-day, 180-day and 1-year
* Chronic Graft-versus-host free relapsed free survival at 180-day and 1-year
* Rate of Neutrophil and platelet engraftment
* Efficacy of donor specific antibody desensitization
* Relapsed rate
* Primary and late graft failure
* Safety and complication of haploHSCT
* Complication of viral, bacterial, and fungal infection
* Viral reactivation
* Comparison outcomes between matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT
* Comparison cost-effectiveness of treatment between matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT Participants will be collected the data of baseline diagnosis, treatment, treatment results of all admission and follow-up visits from hospital medical record.
