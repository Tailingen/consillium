CPX-351 and Glasdegib for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia With MDS Related Changes or Therapy-related Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 2 single-arm, open-label clinical trial determining efficacy of CPX-351 in combination with Glasdegib in subjects with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia with myelodysplastic syndrome related changes or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) Due to Therapy|Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Myelodysplasia-Related Changes
DRUG: Glasdegib|DRUG: CPX-351
Percentage of Participants with Event-Free Survival at 6 months, This is defined as the percentage of subjects with event-free survival (EFS) at 6 months. EFS is defined as the number of months where patients are in a remission state., 6 months
Percentage of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events, To evaluate the tolerability of administering CPX-351 in combination with glasdegib in patients with newly diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) related changes or treatment-related AML from the start of treatment, duration of treatment and up to 4 weeks after completion of study treatment. Toxicity and adverse events are based on the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0., From the start date of treatment until 4 weeks after removal of treatment due to disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 1 year.|Overall Response Rate, To assess the overall response rate to the combination of CPX-351 and glasdegib. The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the rate of complete remissions (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi). ORR = CR + CRi, From the start date of treatment until first date of CR/CRi or an average of 1 year.|Durability of Response, Durability of response is measured by relapse-free survival (RFS). RFS is defined as the amount of time a patient remains in remission after having achieved a CR or CRi, From the start date of treatment until first date of CR/CRi or an average of 1 year.|Overall Survival of Patients who received the combination of CPX-351 and glasdegib, To evaluate the overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) related changes or treatment-related AML., Time from screening biopsy for up to 12 months after the last patient is enrolled or until death from any cause, whichever came first.|Time to normal hematopoiesis as assessed by laboratory studies, To evaluate the time to normal hematopoiesis, process by which blood cells are formed, as determined by laboratory studies inclusive of complete blood counts (CBCs), From the start date of treatment until laboratory studies confirmation of normal hematopoiesis or an average of 1 year|Number of participants who go on to receive an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, This is defined as the number of participants who continue on to receive an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant after induction, re-induction, or consolidation., Up to 3 years
This is a phase 2 single-arm, open-label clinical trial determining efficacy of CPX-351 in combination with Glasdegib in subjects with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia with myelodysplastic syndrome related changes or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia.
