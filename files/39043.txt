Feasibility of Chemotherapy De-escalation in Early-Stage HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
The main purpose of this research study is to find out if de-escalation of chemotherapy before surgery followed by a selective escalation of adjuvant targeted therapies are efficacious and tolerable in early-stage HER2 positive breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine
One Year Invasive Disease-Free Survival, The study will be considered feasible if the researchers observe the invasive disease free survival (IDFS) estimate at one year to be 90% or more among those who achieved a pCR, or if the researchers observe the IDFS estimate at one year to be 85% or more among those who had residual disease., One year from the breast cancer surgery
Pathologic Complete Response rate, Assess the pCR rate after four cycles (12 weeks) of TCHP., 12 weeks from start of treatment|Toxicity of chemo and HER2 therapies, Evaluate toxicity associated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemo and/or HER2 directed therapies. Percentage of grade 1 to grade 5 toxicities will be assessed during the neo-adjuvant TCHP therapy for all participants. Percentage of grade 1 to grade 5 toxicities will be assessed with adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for the cohort with pathological complete response, and with optional adjuvant TCHP therapy and adjuvant TDM1 + pertuzumab therapy for the residual disease cohort. Toxicity data will be obtained based on the clinical assessment of the participants by the investigators and based on laboratory data., One year from the start of treatment|Two Year Invasive Disease-Free Survival, Two year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of participants with pCR and participants with residual disease, Two years from the breast cancer surgery
Assess the feasibility of four cycles of neoadjuvant Docetaxel Carboplatin Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab (TCHP) in women with early-stage (local/locally advanced) HER2+ breast cancer with a selective escalation of targeted HER2 directed therapy in the high risk group in the adjuvant setting. Participants with any residual disease after four cycles of TCHP will receive Trastuzumab Emtansine (TDM1) plus Pertuzumab while those with complete pathological response will receive Trastuzumab in the adjuvant settings.
