Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccine in Immunotherapy (IO) and Non-IO Treated Cancer Patients
Evaluation of antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients treated with IO-treatment, in comparison with antibody titers in patients treated with non-IO treatment.

Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 15 months|Number of immune-related adverse events, 15 months
Blood samples will be analyzed to determine the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy by quantifying antibodies and other tumor or blood-based biomarkers against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes following vaccination. We will also explore for potential development of autoantibodies and other blood-based biomarkers, following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and their correlation with clinical manifestation of IO related immune-related adverse events.
