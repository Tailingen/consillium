Enhancing Radioiodine Incorporation Into Radio Iodine Refractory Thyroid Cancers With MAPK Inhibition
This is a prospective interventional trial that aims to restore iodine incorporation in tumoral lesions of patients with unresectable, radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.
Metastatic Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Trametinib 2 MG [Mekinist]|DRUG: Trametinib 2 MG [Mekinist] and Dabrafenib 75 MG (2-0-2) [Tafinlar]
Proportion of patients with sufficiently increased tumoral iodine incorporation, To determine the proportion of patients with BRAF WT RAIR thyroid cancer in which trametinib and the proportion of patients with BRAF MUT RAIR thyroid cancer in which the combination-therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib can increase tumoral iodine incorporation sufficiently., At the time point of 123I whole-body scintigraphy, 3 weeks after the start of redifferentiation therapy
Changes in thyroglobulin levels, Declines or increases in thyroglobulin levels after redifferentiation therapy, Within 12 months after redifferentiation therapy|The incidence and severity of adverse effects under trametinib (+dabrafenib) treatment, The incidence and severity of adverse effects and necessary therapeutic measures are monitored pursuant to CTCAE 4.0 criteria, Within 3 months
This is a prospective interventional study testing the hypothesis that the inhibition of MEK can restore iodine incorporation in BRAF wild type (WT) and a combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK can restore iodine incorporation in BRAFV600E mutant (MUT), radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) thyroid cancer. Patients with proven iodine negative tumor lesion(s) will be included in this study. Patients will then receive Trametinib (WT-group) or Dabrafenib and Trametinib combination-therapy (MUT-group) for approximately 3 weeks, after which a Thyrogen-stimulated 123I SPECT imaging will be performed. For patients whose tumor(s) demonstrate sufficient iodine incorporation in the post drug treatment 123I SPECT imaging, a treatment according to guidelines for iodine positive lesions will be performed. The follow up of the patients will be conducted as standard of care.
