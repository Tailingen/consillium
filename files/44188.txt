A Study of Ifinatamab Deruxtecan in Subjects With Pretreated Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) (IDeate-Esophageal01)
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd) in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have experienced disease progression following treatment with a platinum-based systemic therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Ifinatamab deruxtecan|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Irinotecan hydrochloride (HCl)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 54 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the first date of disease progression as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 54 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1., From the time of first dose of study drug until date of documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 54 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), which is subsequently confirmed by BICR assessment, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression (confirmed by BICR) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From the time of the first dose of study drug until the date of documented disease progression (as assessed by BICR) or death due to any cause, up to approximately 54 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 and will be determined by BICR assessment review of tumor scans., From the time of the first dose of study drug until the date of documented disease progression (as assessed by BICR) or death due to any cause, up to approximately 54 months|Change from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire Score (EORTC QLQ-C30), Baseline up to 54 months|Change from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Esophageal Cancer Module Score (EORTC OES18), Baseline up to 54 months|Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), A TEAE is defined as an adverse event (AE) with a start or worsening date during the on-treatment period. A serious TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event, or may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes noted. AESIs will also be assessed. AEs will be coded using MedDRA and will be graded using NCI-CTCAE v5.0., Baseline up to 54 months|Percentage of Participants Who Have Treatment-emergent ADA, Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) will be measured in the plasma using a validated assay., Baseline up to 54 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for I-DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1: Before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 3 hours (hr), 6hr, 24hr, 72hr, 168hr, 336hr, 504hr postdose; Cycle 2: BI and EOI; Cycle 3: BI, EOI, and 6hr postdose; Cycle 4, 5, & every 2 cycles thereafter, up to 54 mths: BI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for Total Anti-B7-H3 Antibody, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1: Before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 3 hours (hr), 6hr, 24hr, 72hr, 168hr, 336hr, 504hr postdose; Cycle 2: BI and EOI; Cycle 3: BI, EOI, and 6hr postdose; Cycle 4, 5, & every 2 cycles thereafter, up to 49 mths: BI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for MAAA-1181a, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1: Before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 3 hours (hr), 6hr, 24hr, 72hr, 168hr, 336hr, 504hr postdose; Cycle 2: BI and EOI; Cycle 3: BI, EOI, and 6hr postdose; Cycle 4, 5, & every 2 cycles thereafter, up to 49 mths: BI (each cycle is 21 days)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall survival (OS) benefit of I-DXd compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC).

The key secondary objectives of the study will evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) benefit of I-DXd compared with ICC.
