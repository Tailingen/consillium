A Multicentre, Non-Blinded Study Exploring Self-Administration of Chemotherapy in the Home Environment
This study is to see if the standard of care subcutaneous injection of bortezomib can safely be administered at home by the patient or caregiver. All tests and assessments are based on standard of care procedures.

Chemotherapy for malignancies is predominantly prescribed and delivered in a tertiary hospital and/or cancer centre setting. However, with modern chemotherapy, with a reduced side effect profile, this paradigm should be challenged. Indeed, the use of methotrexate and other biologics (a form of chemotherapy) in the Rheumatologic setting is commonly delivered effectively and safely in the community.

Taken together, a hospital-based model of chemotherapy delivery may not be warranted in all circumstances. Moreover, the use of this current model invariably discounts the time commitments, needs of patients and caregivers, as well as while not addressing the emerging concerns regarding system capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of safe chemotherapy delivery.
