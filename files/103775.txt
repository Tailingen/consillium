A Look Back at How Well Interventional Treatments Work for Bronchopleural Fistulas in Patients With Lung Metastases From Osteosarcoma
Patients with pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma complicated with BPF often suffer from massive hemoptysis, refractory pneumothorax and difficult fistula healing due to tumor erosion of bronchial arteries. Traditional interventional embolization (such as simple coil or gelatin sponge embolization) has some limitations such as embolic material displacement, incomplete fistula closure and postoperative recurrent bleeding. Systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy also have poor efficacy due to the complex blood supply of local lesions and poor tissue repair ability, and the quality of life of patients is seriously impaired. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore a safer and durable precise embolization scheme.

NBCA combined with coil closure is expected to break through the current technical bottleneck through the synergistic mechanism of "colloid embolization + mechanical occlusion". NBCA glue can quickly polymerize to achieve permanent occlusion of the micro vascular network, while the coil can strengthen the fistula through physical support. The combination of the two can not only accurately block abnormal blood supply, promote fistula healing, but also reduce the risk of embolus displacement and hemoptysis recurrence rate. This study is the first to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen in such patients, and provide key evidence for optimizing the embolization strategy and improving the long-term prognosis.

The clinical transformation value and social significance of this study are significant. If NBCA combined with coil is proved to be effective in controlling bleeding, shortening fistula closure time and reducing complications, it will promote this technology to become the first choice for advanced osteosarcoma pulmonary metastasis with complex fistula. Its minimally invasive and repeatability can help to reduce the frequency of repeated hospitalization and the risk of infection, save medical resources, and provide new ideas for the exploration of multimodal embolization techniques in interventional medicine, which has a profound impact on improving the quality of life of patients with end-stage cancer.
