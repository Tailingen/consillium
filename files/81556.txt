A Multicenter, Open Label Phase I Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of TQB2252 Injection in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This study is a multicenter, single arm, and open design Phase I clinical trial aimed at evaluating the safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of TQB2252 injection in subjects with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Cancers
DRUG: TQB2252 injection
Adverse events (AE) rate, The evaluation criteria for the nature and severity of adverse events are based on the National Cancer Institute's CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 5.0)., From date of the first dose until the date of 28 days after last dose or new anti-tumor treatment, whichever came first.
Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), Time to reach maximum (peak) plasma concentration following drug administration, Day1 of Cycle1, Cycle3: within 30 minutes pre-dose, 0.25, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168, 336 hour post dose. Day1 of Cycle2, Cycle4～Cycle 8: pre-dose. (Each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration of TQB2252., Day1 of Cycle1, Cycle3: within 30 minutes pre-dose, 0.25, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168, 336 hour post dose. Day1 of Cycle2, Cycle4～Cycle 8: pre-dose. (Each cycle is 21 days)|Elimination half-life (t1/2), Terminal phase elimination half-life (T1/2) is the time required for half of the drug to be eliminated from the plasma., Day1 of Cycle1, Cycle3: within 30 minutes pre-dose, 0.25, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168, 336 hour post dose. Day1 of Cycle2, Cycle4～Cycle 8: pre-dose. (Each cycle is 21 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first dose of TQB2252 to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)., up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first documented response to documented disease progression., up to 2 years
