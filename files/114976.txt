High-dose Vitamin D3 in Pancreas Cancer
Different studies have shown that a deficiency in vitamin D (≤20ng/mL) results in higher rates in morbidity and mortality rates in cancer patients. Clinical studies investigated and demonstrated altered vitamin d tissue in pancreatic cancer. But there is no prospective study evaluating the beneficiary effects of oral supplementation of vitamin d in altered vitamin d tissue from pancreatic cancer. We want to examine the effect of a high dose vitamin D3 therapy vs. a standard base dose vitamin D3 therapy in pancreas cancer patients with a vitamin D deficiency. In case of benefit in our results we could implement vitamin D3 as a supportive standard therapy in pancreatic cancer patients.
