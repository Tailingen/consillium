A Multi-centre Trial on Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) for Localized Prostate Cancer
This study is to investigate the efficacy of Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) under MRI-Ultrasound fusion and organ-based tracking (OBT) navigation in localized prostate cancer (PCa) in a multi-centre trial.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Targeted Microwave Ablation (TMA) for localized prostate cancer using organ based tracking (OBT) navigation
The oncological control of prostate cancer, Any cancer detected on biopsy of each ablated area, At 6 months after treatment
Cancer detection on biopsy of each ablated MRI visible lesion, Cancer detection on biopsy of each ablated MRI visible lesion, At 6 months after treatment|Cancer detection on biopsy of each ablated MRI invisible lesion, Cancer detection on biopsy of each ablated MRI invisible lesion, At 6 months after treatment|Gleason 4 or 5 cancer detected on biopsy of ablated area, The higher the Gleason score, the higher grade the prostate cancer, At 6 months after treatment|Out-of-field recurrence: Any cancer outside treated area on systematic biopsy, Out-of-field recurrence: Any cancer outside treated area on systematic biopsy, At 6 months after treatment|Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, Complications of treatment using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, At 3 Month, 6 Month and 1 year|PSA change, PSA change after treatment, At baseline, 3 Month and 6 Month and 12 Month|Urinary Symptoms after treatment, Urinary symptoms measured by IPSS score, score ranging from 0-35 (the higher the worse), At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Sexual side effects after treatment, Sexual side effects, up to 1 year, measured by IIEF-5 score (ranging from 1-25), the lower the worse, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Continence side effects after treatment, Continence side effects, up to 1 year, measured by EPIC-26 questionnaire, the higher score the lower score the worse, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) rectal toxicity, Rectal toxicity of treatment using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Quality of life measured by ED-5Q-5Lquestionnaire, Quality of life measured by ED-5Q-5L questionnaire, the higher the score the better in quality of life, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Quality of life in patients with prostate cancer measured by EPIC-26, Quality of life in patients with prostate cancer measured by EPIC-26 range 0-100, the higher score the better the quality of life, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month|Quality of life measured by QLQ-C30,, Quality of life measured by QLQ-C30, score 0-100, the higher the score the better in quality of life, At baseline, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month
This is a prospective multi-centre trial in 5 hospitals in 3 countries to investigate the efficacy and complications of targeted Microwave Ablation as a minimally invasive focal therapy for prostate cancer. Men aged 50-75 with PSA \< 20ng/mL and clinically significant prostate cancer with 1-2 MRI lesions ≤15mm and ISUP grade group ≤3 will be recruited. Transperineal targeted Microwave Ablation of the prostate tumor(s) will be done with repeated ablations by a single microwave needle guided by MRI-Ultrasound fusion and organ-based tracking navigation. The primary outcome is any clinically significant prostate cancer detected on biopsy of treated area(s) per patient at 6 months.
