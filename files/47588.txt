NLG802 Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO) Inhibitor in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating oral doses of NLG802, an investigational agent intended to inhibit the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme and help the human immune system attack solid tumor cells more effectively.
