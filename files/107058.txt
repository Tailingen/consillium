This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to explore the effectiveness of AC591 particles in preventing oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. Patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who are prepared to receive CAPEOX (capecitabine tablets + oxaliplatin injection) postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy within 3 weeks to 2 months after surgery will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The subjects will be stratified based on the chemotherapy cycles they are prepared to receive CAPEOX (4 cycles vs 8 cycles).
