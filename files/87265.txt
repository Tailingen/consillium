Autologous CD30.CAR-T in Combination With Nivolumab in cHL Patients After Failure of Frontline Therapy
This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy, CD30.CAR-T and the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients aged 12 years of age and above with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) following failure of standard frontline therapy.

Safety of autologous CD30.CAR-T in combination with nivolumab, DLT, From first dose of nivolumab (Cycle 1) to end of nivolumab Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)
Anti-tumor activity using CR rate of autologous CD30.CAR-T in combination with nivolumab, CR rate, Up to end of 10 weeks post-CD30.CAR-T treatment|Overall response rate, ORR, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis|Duration of response, DOR, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis|Progression-free survival, PFS, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis
Overall survival, OS, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis|Pharmacokinetics - Maximum concentration (Cmax), Maximum concentration of CD30.CAR-T, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis|Pharmacokinetics - Time of maximum concentration (Tmax), Time to peak concentration of CD30.CAR-T in the blood, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis|Pharmacokinetics - Area under the curve, Area under the curve of CD30.CAR-T in the blood, Through study completion, an average of 3 years from Leukapheresis
Upon successful leukapheresis to produce CD30.CAR-T cells, patients will enter the treatment phase of the study. Treatments will include 4 cycles of nivolumab and CD30.CAR-T infusion (preceded by lymphodepletion chemotherapy). Patients will then enter the post-treatment follow-up phase of the study, whereby patients will undergo either autologous stem cell transplant or continue to receive up to 6 additional treatment cycles of nivolumab. Patients will be followed for response assessments and safety monitoring until end of study (EOS); approximately 3 years after leukapheresis. Long-term follow-up will continue with additional safety monitoring and survival for up to 15 years after Leukapheresis.
