Flotufolastat F 18 PET in Men with Very Low PSA Recurrence
The purpose of this study is to assess detection rate of flotufolastat F 18 positron emission tomography (PET) for low prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) following radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)|Prostate Specific Antigen
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
Detection Rate, The detection rate is defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who have at least one positive lesion (localized correspondence between flotufolastat F 18 PET/CT imaging and the reference standard) regardless of coexisting false positive findings., Periprocedural to date of detected lesion
This is a prospective single arm study for the use of flotufolastat F 18 PET in men with very low prostate specific antigen recurrence. The research study involves collecting flotufolastat F 18 PET images to evaluate the detection rate. Flotufolastat F 18 is a radiopharmaceutical (radioactive agent) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved. Participation in this study will be for the duration of the flotufolastat F 18 PET scan. It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.
