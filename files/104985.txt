Phase 1 Study of Allo-RevCAR01-T-CD123 in Patients With Selected CD123 Positive Hematologic Malignancies
The Allo-RevCAR01-T-CD123 drug is a combination of a cellular component (Allo-RevCAR01-T) with a recombinant antibody derivative (R-TM123), which together form the active drug. The cellular component Allo-RevCAR01-T consists of an allogeneic human T-cell genetically multi-edited and expressing a reversed, universal chimeric antigen receptor (RevCAR) presenting an extracellular peptide epitope (RevCAR epitope). R-TM123 functions as a bridging module between Allo-RevCAR01-T and a CD123-expressing target cancer cell by selectively binding the RevCAR epitope and CD123.
