Computer-Guided Glucose Management Systems in Treating Patients With Hyperglycemia Who Have Undergone Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant
This clinical trial studies computer-guided glucose management systems in treating patients with hyperglycemia who have undergone blood and bone marrow transplant. A computer-guided glucose management system may help manage glucose levels in patients who have undergone blood or bone marrow transplant.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine the ability of computer-guided glucose management system (CGGMS) algorithms to control glucose within or close to current University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) intensive care unit (ICU) targets (100 to 140 mg/dl) in non-critically ill bone marrow transplant (BMT) adult (age \>= 18 years) patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive blood glucose management with intravenous (IV) insulin using Glucommander.
