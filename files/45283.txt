RGL-305+ Lymphoma + Exploratory Clinical Study
This study is an open, prospective, dose-increasing exploratory clinical trial. To evaluate the safety, cytodynamics and initial efficacy of RGL-305 in patients with lymphoma. All enrolled lymphoma patients were required to achieve CR or PR and MRD positive after standard treatment, PR patients were required to have a Deauville score of 4, and all patients would receive RGL-305 cell reinfusion therapy.
Lymphoma Patients With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) After Standard Treatment Had a Positive Minimal Residual Lesion (MRD)
DRUG: RGL-305
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RGL-305, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE)/serious adverse events (SAE) (severity based on CTCAE v 5.0 criteria) and association of adverse events with the investigational drug

- Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) incidence of DLT during the observation period, up to 2 years
To evaluate the cytodynamics of RGL-305 after reinfusion, Flow cytometry was used to detect the number and proportion of Target cells in peripheral blood and the changes compared with baseline, up to 2 years
This study adopted a "3+3" dose escalation design. RGL-305 preset two dose groups: low dose and high dose , and each dose group planned to enroll 3 to 6 subjects. The first patient in each group was set as a sentinel subject and observed for at least 48 hours. After evaluation by the investigators, it was found that no important adverse reactions occurred (such as CRS â‰¥ grade 3, aGVHD, anaphylaxis, etc.), and the other subjects at this dose level could be administered. The DLT observation period was set to 21 days after the subject received RGL-305 for the first time, during which the subject continued to receive the same dose level of RGL-305 for 1 cycle every 2 weeks (Q2W) and the first day of each cycle (D1), receiving a total of up to 5 cycles of cell transfusion. Treatment until the end of the cycle, disease recurrence or disease progression, intolerable toxicity, initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy, death (whichever occurs first)
