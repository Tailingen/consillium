Seoul National University Pituitary Disease Cohort Study
The purpose of this study is to investigate the treatment and natural history of pituitary disease. We have a longstanding interest in pituitary disease including acromegaly, central diabetes insipidus, and nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. We will continue to follow patients and recruit new patients for treatment and follow-up. Blood and pituitary tumor tissue (when available through clinical care) will be saved for future analyses related to pituitary disease.
