The Pharmacokinetic Variability of Sunitinib in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the percentage of patients with a plasma concentration of sunitinib remaining at equilibrium (\[Suni\]REq) greater than 100 ng / ml (effective concentration according to the current literature).
