A Study of a Patient-Specific Neoantigen Vaccine in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Blockade for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to characterize the clinical activity of maintenance therapy with GRT-C901/GRT-R902 (patient-specific vaccines) in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in addition to fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab versus a fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab alone as assessed by molecular response which is based on changes in circulating tumor (ct)DNA. The primary objective of the Phase 3 portion is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the regimen as assessed by progression-free survival.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: GRT-C901|DRUG: GRT-R902|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Fluoropyrimidine plus leucovorin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Phase 2: Molecular response defined as â‰¥ 30% decrease from baseline in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), Baseline and up to 27 months|Phase 3: Progression-free survival per Immune-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) as assessed by blinded independent review committee (IRC), defined by time from randomization until disease progression as per iRECIST or death from any cause, Up to 60 months
Phase 2 and 3: Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), immune-related AEs, treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to death, AEs leading to dose delays, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Progression-free survival per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by the investigator, Phase 2: up to 27 months, Phase 3: up to 60 months|Phase 3: Progression-free survival per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded IRC, Up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Overall Survival as time from randomization to death from any cause, Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Overall Response Rate, measured by the proportion of patients with best overall response (BOR) of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) by REICST v1.1 or , immune-based PR (iPR) or immune-based by iRECIST, Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Duration of response (DOR) defined by time from the first objective response of PR or PR until disease progression or death, Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Clinical benefit rate (CBR) as defined by the proportion of patients with best overall response of stable disease (SD), PR or CR using RECIS v1.1 or immune-based SD (iSD), iPR, or iCR by iRECIST., Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: Deepening of Response the proportion of patients who have a BOR of SD or PR during the VPS and who convert from SD to PR or CR, or from PR to CR after start of the study treatment and/or SOC maintenance treatment in the STS per RECIST v1.1, VPS = Vaccine Production Stage; STS = Study Treatment Stage, Phase 2 up to 27 months, Phase 3 up to 60 months|Phase 2 and 3: The feasibility of manufacturing a patient-specific vaccine defined by the proportion of patients for whom vaccine was successfully manufactured from those randomized to the vaccine arm., Study Treatment Screening visit (up to 28 days before Day 1 of study drug administration)
Tumors harboring non-synonymous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations can present peptides containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on the tumor cell surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens capable of generating T-cell responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Sensitive detection of these mutations allows for the identification of neoantigens unique to each patient's tumor to be included in a patient-specific cancer vaccine that targets these neoantigens. This vaccine regimen uses two vaccine vectors as a heterologous prime/boost approach (GRT-C901 first followed by GRT-R902) to stimulate an immune response. This study will explore the anti-tumor activity of this patient-specific immunotherapy in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in addition to fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab.
