Optimal Treatment on Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) With Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension
There is no consensus about the optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhotic portal hypertension, While this group of patients are classified as hepatectomy contraindication according to guidelines from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). With improvement of surgical technique, preoperative evaluation, and perioperative management,especially the Precise Hepatectomy Technique, more and more studies confirmed the safety of surgical intervention to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension.However, most of the previous studies were either retrospective or with small samples.

The investigators project is a prospective randomized controlled trial, planning to compare the safety, efficacy and quality of life between precise hepatectomy and combined interventional treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhotic portal hypertension, to make a further understanding of optimal strategy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC)|Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension
PROCEDURE: Precise hepatectomy|OTHER: Combined intervention (chemoembolization/ablation)
Overall survival, Overall survival is based on death from any cause, not just the condition being treated, thus it picks up death from side effects of the treatment, and effects on survival after relapse, 5 years
Treatment complication, defined as complications within the 90 days after treatment, 90 days|Time to progress(TTP), TTP: The Hazard Ratio will be analyzed respectively with 95% confidence interval. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier estimation and survival curves will be performed., 3 years|Disease control rate(DCR), Disease control rate: Calculate the disease control rate of the two treatment groups (disease control rate) and its 95% confidence interval, and make a descriptive analysis., 3 years|Quality of life(Qol), Quality of life: Follow the QOL-LC V2.0, 5 years
