Evaluating the Efficacy of Structured Exercise Interventions in Alleviating Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia in Breast Cancer Survivors: a Pilot Study Protocol
Endocrine therapy represents a foundational approach for managing hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, with treatment typically spanning 5 to 10 years. Although its clinical efficacy is well-established, medications like aromatase inhibitors frequently result in musculoskeletal (MS) complications, such as joint discomfort, stiffness (especially in the morning), carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, myalgia, and reduced muscle strength. These issues, which can manifest intermittently or persistently, impact both central joints (spine, hips, shoulders) and peripheral ones (elbows, wrists, knees, feet), thereby substantially diminishing patients' quality of life (QoL). Evidence suggests that physical activity can mitigate these symptoms; however, adherence to exercise routines remains insufficient. Moreover, there is no agreement regarding the most effective type, intensity, or duration of exercise, and standardized guidelines are absent. Acknowledging the need for exercise as a sustainable habit, this research aims to design a home-based rehabilitation program customized for individuals undergoing endocrine therapy.

WOMAC, Developed in 1988 by Bellamy and Buchanan, the WOMAC index evaluates pain, stiffness, and physical function in knee or hip osteoarthritis patients over the past 48 hours . The WOMAC 3.1 version contains 24 items scored using either a VAS (0-100 mm) or a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). This study will use the VAS version, with pain (5 items, 0-500 points), stiffness (2 items, 0-200 points), and physical function (17 items, 0-1700 points) subscales. Total scores range from 0 to 2400, with higher scores indicating greater symptom burden. Scores below 800 denote mild symptoms, 800-1200 moderate, and above 1200 severe symptoms., Baseline and 1month|Grip strength, Grip strength will be measured by the exercise group at baseline (0 months) and at 1, 3, and 6 months of intervention. An electronic hand dynamometer (CAMRY EH10) will be used for assessment. Participants will perform the test by extending their arms straight down with their palms facing their thighs, abducting their dominant upper limb (on the non-surgical side) by 30 degrees. The grip strength value, displayed in kilograms on the dynamometer, will represent the maximum force achieved. To ensure accuracy, participants will be instructed not to swing their arms, squat, or allow the dynamometer to touch their body during the test. Each participant will undergo three assessments, with a 60-second interval between measurements, and the highest value will be used for analysis., Baseline and 1month|M-SACRAH, The SACRAH, developed by Leeb et al. in 2003, is a validated tool for assessing chronic rheumatic hand conditions. The Modified Score for the Assessment of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH), a shorter and simplified version of SACRAH, has shown similar reliability and representativeness. M-SACRAH contains 12 items scored using a visual analog scale (VAS, 0-100 mm) across three dimensions: pain (2 items, 0-200 points), stiffness (2 items, 0-200 points), and physical function (8 items, 0-800 points). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms, with a total possible score of 0-1200., Baseline and 1month|BCTQ, The BCTQ consists of 11 items assessing symptom severity (Symptom Severity Score, SSS) and 8 items evaluating functional status (Function Scale Score, FSS) . The SSS addresses issues such as nocturnal pain, frequency of night awakenings, daytime wrist pain, hand numbness or weakness, and difficulty handling small objects. The FSS evaluates activities like writing, buttoning clothes, carrying groceries, and performing household tasks. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, with 1 indicating "none" and 5 indicating "severe." The average score across all items represents the final score., Baseline and 1month|Range of Motion, Tools for ROM measurement include goniometers, rulers, and electronic measuring devices. The goniometer comprises a stationary arm (proximal arm) with a semicircular (0째-180째) or circular (0째-360째) angle scale and a movable arm (distal arm) attached via a rivet. The movable arm rotates with the limb, allowing ROM to be read from the scale., Baseline and 1month
