SIRT Versus cTACE for Unresectable HCC (CHANCE2506)
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres versus cTACE in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres versus in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. This multicenter, prospective, open-label, phase 3 trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres versus conventional TACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint is time to progression for patients with HCC. While the secondary endpoints include the overall response rate, duration of response, local time to progression, tumor biomarkers variation, overall survival and adverse events.
