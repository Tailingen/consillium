Study of Iomab-B vs. Conventional Care in Older Subjects With Active, Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Iomab-B, in conjunction with a Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) regimen and protocol-specified allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), versus Conventional Care in patients with Active, Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

SIERRA is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled study of Iomab-B in Relapsed or Refractory AML patients. The SIERRA trial has a primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission (dCR) at six months and a secondary endpoint of overall survival following randomization to Iomab-B, as well as Event-Free Survival. Iomab-B is intended to prepare and condition patients for a bone marrow transplant, also referred to as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in a potentially safer and more efficacious manner than intensive chemotherapy conditioning that is the current standard of care in bone marrow transplant conditioning.
