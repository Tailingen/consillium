A Clinical Trial With Intranasal Fentanyl in Cancer Patients With Breakthrough Pain
The aim of this clinical trial was to demonstrate the efficacy of a 400 μg dose strength of intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS, Instanyl®) and to evaluate the safety and to establish long term tolerability of treatment with INFS doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg.
Break Through Pain|Cancer
DRUG: Intranasal Fentanyl Spray (INFS)|DRUG: Placebo
Induction Phase: Pain Intensity Difference at 10 Minutes (PID10) After Treatment, During the efficacy phase participants assessed their pain intensity at each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode at 0 and 10 minutes after first dose using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is "worst possible pain". PID10 is calculated as the difference in pain intensity from time 0 to 10 minutes. A positive value is a decrease (improvement) of the pain; a ≥ 2-point difference is considered as clinically important., During the efficacy phase (II), at each episode of breakthrough pain, at 0 and 10 minutes after first dose of study drug.
Incidence of Improvement or Worsening in Nasal Mucosa Sign or Abnormality Score, Medical examination of the nasal cavity by rhinoscopy was performed by an oto-rhino-laryngologist before the start of study treatment and at 12 weeks. Signs and any abnormalities were observed for each nostril using the following 4 points assessment scale: • 0 =not present; • 1 =present in a mild degree; • 2 =present in a moderate degree; • 3 =present in a severe degree. A difference in score of 1 or more from Baseline to the end of treatment represented a worsening, while a negative value indicated an improvement of the observed clinical sign. The oto-rhino-laryngologist also assessed whether worsening of a sign was related to study drug. Assessments for both left and right nostrils are presented together. The incidence is calculated as the number of assessments (n) in the improvement or worsening category divided by the number of assessments with a non-missing score for the Nasal Mucosa or Abnormality assessment. Only those signs or abnormalities with n\>0 were included, Baseline and at 12 weeks|Efficacy Phase: Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at 5, 30, and 60 Minutes After First Dose of Study Drug, During the efficacy phase participants assessed their pain intensity at each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after first dose using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is "worst possible pain". PID is calculated as the difference in pain intensity from time 0 to each time point. A positive value is a decrease (improvement) of the pain; a ≥ 2-point difference is considered as clinically important., During the efficacy phase (II) each episode of breakthrough pain, at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after study drug.|Efficacy Phase: Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID0-60 and SPID0-30) Derived From PI Scores, The SPID30 and SPID60 represent the average improvement in pain intensity over the 30 minute interval and 60 minute interval, respectively. SPIDt was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) for Pain Intensity Difference over the time interval 0 to t minutes, respectively, divided by the length of the time interval (t minutes). A positive value is a decrease (improvement) of the pain.

Pain intensity was assessed at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after study drug using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is "worst possible pain". PID is calculated as the difference in pain intensity from time 0 to each time point., During the efficacy phase (II) each episode of breakthrough pain, at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after study drug|Efficacy Phase: Proportion of BTP Episodes With a Positive Response Defined as a ≥ 1, 2 or 3 Point Reduction in Pain Intensity, Overall responder rate is defined as the proportion of breakthrough pain (BTP) episodes with a positive response to treatment. The following definitions of a positive response were analyzed: • greater than or equal to 1 point reduction in pain intensity (PI) from time 0, • greater than or equal to 2 point reduction in PI from time 0, and • greater than or equal to 3 point reduction in PI from time 0. Pain intensity was assessed using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is "worst possible pain"., During the efficacy phase (II) each episode of breakthrough pain, at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after study drug|Efficacy Phase: Proportion of BTP Episodes With a Positive Response Defined as a ≥ 33% or 50% Reduction in Pain Intensity, Overall responder rate is defined as the proportion of breakthrough pain (BTP) episodes with a positive response to treatment. The following definitions of a positive response were analyzed: • Greater than 33% reduction in PI from time 0; • Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in PI from time 0. Pain intensity was assessed using the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 is "worst possible pain"., During the efficacy phase (II) each episode of breakthrough pain, at 0, 5, 30 and 60 minutes after study drug|Efficacy Phase: General Impression (GI) Score at 60 Minutes After First Dose, Participants assessed their general impression (GI) of treatment efficacy for treated BTP episodes at 60 minutes after first dose of study drug. The validated, categorical 5-point Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) was used for this assessment and scored as follows:

* 0 =poor;
* 1 =fair;
* 2 =good;
* 3 =very good;
* 4 =excellent., During the efficacy phase (II), at each episode of breakthrough pain, 60 minutes after first dose of study drug.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), The severity (intensity of each AE was assessed as mild (transient symptoms, no interference with daily activities), moderate (marked symptoms, moderate interference with daily activities), or severe (considerable interference with daily activities) by the investigator. Serious adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death or is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The investigator assessed each AE as either related or not related to study treatment., 12 weeks
This is a clinical trial with 12 weeks treatment of Intranasal fentanyl (INFS) in cancer patients with breakthrough pain (BTP). It was composed of a dose titrated, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, cross-over efficacy phase, combined with a titration and a tolerability phase assessing the safety and nasal tolerability of INFS. The trial is set up with a screening period and three treatment phases: a titration phase (I), an efficacy phase (II) and a tolerability phase (III). The entire trial period for each completed patient consisted of the one week screening period and 12 weeks treatment with INFS.
