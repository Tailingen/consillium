NK Cells Infusion for Advanced Malignancies
This study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of natural killer (NK) cell infusion as treatment for patients with advanced malignant tumors after multiline therapy, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of NK cells in patients
Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: NK cells infusion
Successful expansion of NK cells in patient's circulatory system, CD56 positive cells ≥100 cells/μL in blood is considered as successful expansion of NK cells, 7 days after the last treatment|Objective Response Rate, The percentage of patients who reach complete response（CR）or partial response （PR）after all treatment finished. The response is evaluated according to irRECIST., 4 weeks after all the treatment finished
Overall survival, The interval time from the date when patients are enrolled into study to death or the last visit, 1 and 2 years after treatment|Disease progression free survival, The interval time from the date when patients are enrolled into study to disease progression, death or last visit, 1 and 2 years after treatment|Dynamic changes of NK cells number in blood, Numbers of CD56 positive cell in peripheral blood, Day 1,3,5,7,10,14,21,28 and 2, 3, 6 months after NK cells infusion finished
