FLT-PET/MRI for Early Response Monitoring to Novel Cancer Therapeutic Agents
This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in measuring early response in patients with metastatic solid tumors receiving treatment that blocks blood flow to the tumor. Diagnostic procedures, such as FLT-PET/MRI, may help measure a patient's response earlier during treatment.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
OTHER: fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine|DEVICE: positron emission tomography|DEVICE: magnetic resonance imaging
Concordance analysis of standardized uptake values (SUVs) between the 2 baseline scans, A sample size of 20 produces a two-sided 95% confidence interval \[0.553, 0.918\] for the Pearson correlation coefficient when the sample correlation is 0.80. Additional analysis for concordance will include Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation., Baseline|Comparative Analysis of PET/MRI Images, Describe changes in images at baseline PET/MRI scan compared to PET/MRI image taken after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy, Up to 4 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

The primary objective of this pilot imaging study is to determine the feasibility of FLTPET/MR imaging for early prediction of treatment response in patients undergoing antiangiogenic cancer treatment. The study will assess PET/MRI test-retest reproducibility and compare baseline PET/MRI with PET/MRI after initiation (within 2-4 weeks) of antiangiogenic therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To compare early changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).
* To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment response assessed at completion of therapy.
* To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with FLT tumor uptake.
* To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo FLT-PET/MRI twice at baseline and once within 4 weeks after start of treatment.
