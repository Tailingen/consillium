Addition of microRNA Blood Test to Lung Cancer Screening Low Dose CT
To demonstrate that the specificity of the Hummingbird microRNA profile for the diagnosis of lung cancer in a cohort of patients who meet current eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening in the U.S. is superior to the specificity of LDCT.
Lung Cancer
Specificity of HMBDx microRNA Test for Lung Cancer, The reference standard will be the combination of all available diagnostic information (LDCT, subsequent diagnostic imaging studies, biopsy results and surgical pathology results) obtained during at least 12 months of follow-up., 12 months
This is a prospective, longitudinal, blinded, observational diagnostic study on 400 individuals undergoing lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).

There will be two patient cohorts: Cohort 1: individuals undergoing their first or subsequent annual LDCT screening study; and Cohort 2: individuals referred for a follow-up diagnostic chest CT scan due to a lung-RADS category 3 or 4 result on a previous LDCT scan.

At study enrollment a blood sample will be drawn prior to the LDCT scan. On this blood sample a novel lung cancer test relying on microRNA signatures will be evaluated. The results will be compared with the CT scan results and follow-up tests including pathology. Histologic results and follow-up data will be collected on all patients for a minimum of 12 months post-enrollment. During the follow-up period, the results of all diagnostic chest CT scans, lung biopsies or lung resections will be captured from the Partners electronic medical record and entered into the case report form (CRF).
