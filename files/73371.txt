The purpose of this study is to determine whether bendamustine HCl for injection is safe and effective in the treatment of Rituximab refractory or relapsed B-cell indolent lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma by Clinical Course
DRUG: Bendamustine
Overall response rate (ORR=CR+PR) of bendamustine hydrochloride in patients who are refractory to rituximab therapy., 18 months
Safety profile of Bendamustine hydrochloride in this patient population, 18 months|Progression free survival (PFS), 18 months|Overall survival (OS), 18 months
This is multicenter, open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine HCl in patients with indolent Non-hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed after rituximab treatment. This injection will be given through i.v. infusion in \>= 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 of every 21-day treatment cycle. Patients will be treated for up to 8 cycles unless progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity take place. Patients will be followed for up to 1 year before evaluating progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
