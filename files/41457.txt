Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of Balstilimab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Lymphomas (IMMONC0001)
The goal of this study is to see if the drug balstilimab is safe and effective in participants with relapsed/refractory lymphomas.

Participants will receive balstilimab every 3 weeks and their outcomes will be assessed periodically.
Lymphoma
DRUG: Balstilimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed per the Lugano criteria, First dose to up to 27 months
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from first observation of response to first observation of documented disease progression per the Lugano criteria or death within 12 weeks of last tumor assessment, First dose to up to 27 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response or stable disease per the Lugano criteria, First dose to up to 27 months|Duration of Stable Disease (SD), Duration of SD is measured from the start of treatment until the criteria for progression are met, per the Lugano criteria, First dose to up to 27 months|Time to Response, Time to Response is defined as the time from the first dose date to first observation of confirmed response per the Lugano criteria, First dose to up to 27 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS time is defined as time from first treatment administration to first observation of documented disease progression (or death within 12 weeks after last tumor assessment), per the Lugano criteria, First dose to up to 27 months|Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS Time is defined as time from start of treatment to death, First dose to up to 48 months|Baseline expression of PD-L1 association with ORR, Tumor PD-L1 status will be determined and correlation with ORR will be investigated, First dose to up to 48 months|Baseline expression of PD-L1 association with DOR, Tumor PD-L1 status will be determined and correlation with DOR will be investigated, First dose to up to 48 months|Baseline expression of PD-L1 association with PFS, Tumor PD-L1 status will be determined and correlation with PFS time will be investigated, First dose to up to 48 months|Baseline expression of PD-L1 association with OS, Tumor PD-L1 status will be determined and correlation with OS time will be investigated, First dose to up to 48 months|Frequency, severity, and duration of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and laboratory abnormalities, TEAEs are reported using the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, First dose to up to 27 months
This is a single-arm, open-label phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent balstilimab in participants with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. The study will enroll participants with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. The participants will receive balstilimab (BAL) 300 mg IV every 3 weeks. BAL infusions will be administered within 30 minutes (Â± 5 min) using an infusion pump.

The total estimated maximum time of study participation for each patient is approximately 49 months across 3 periods:

* Screening Period: approximately 28 days
* Treatment Period: up to 24 months, or until any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the study occurs
* Follow-up Period: up to 24 months from last dose of study treatment for every patient who is alive

Study Duration

* Recruitment: 2 years
* Treatment: 2 years
* Follow-up: 2 years
