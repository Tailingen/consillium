Neo-adjuvant Gemcitabine, Epirubicin, ABI-007 (GEA) in Locally Advanced or Inflammatory Breast Cancer
In this trial we will evaluate ABI-007 with gemcitabine and epirubicin, utilizing the biweekly pegfilgrastim support, in order to further improve upon the effectiveness and favorable toxicity of this triplet.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Albumin-bound Paclitaxel
Pathologic Complete Response, For the purpose of this study, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no evidence of residual invasive tumor in the breast (pT0) and axillary lymph nodes (pN0), gross or microscopic, in the sample removed at the time of surgical resection. Residual ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ was not considered in pCR assessments. Percentage of participants who experienced pCR is reported., 18 months
Clinical Response Rates, Clinical response rate is defined as percentage of patients whose disease decreased (Partial response - PR) and/or disappeared (Complete response - CR) after treatment). Clinical tumor response was defined as complete if there was no clinical evidence of palpable tumor in either the breast or axilla at the time of surgery. Reduction of total tumor size \>50 % at the time surgery was considered a clinical partial response. Evaluations are based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 18 months|Time to Disease Progression, Time to progression is the length of time from the start of treatment until the disease progressed. Progressive disease is defined as an increase of \>25% in the total calculated product of the tumor's measurements or development of a new lesion. Evaluations are based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 36 months|Rates of Breast Preservation, Number of patients who underwent breast conservation after neo adjuvant chemotherapy, 18 months
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive both induction neo-adjuvant regimen and a postoperative adjuvant regimen:

Induction Neo-adjuvant: Epirubicin + Gemcitabine + ABI-007 + Pegfilgrastim

Postoperative Adjuvant: Gemcitabine + ABI-007 + Pegfilgrastim

Upon completion of chemotherapy, all ER and/or PR+ patients will receive Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor at physician discretion.
