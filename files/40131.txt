P-MUC1C-ALLO1 Allogeneic CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
A Phase 1, open label, dose escalation and expanded cohort study of P-MUC1C-ALLO1 in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic epithelial derived solid tumors, including but not limited to the tumor types listed below.
Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Nasopharyngeal Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Gastric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: P-MUC1C-ALLO1 CAR-T cells|DRUG: Rimiducid
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of P-MUC1C-ALLO1, Number of subjects with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Baseline through Day 28|Evaluate the overall safety and tolerability profile of P-MUC1C-ALLO1, Frequency and severity of adverse events, Baseline through 15 years|Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of P-MUC1C-ALLO1, According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, secondarily Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST): Overall Response Rate (ORR), Baseline through 15 years
This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study that will follow a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts of single and multiple doses of P-MUC1C-ALLO1 to determine a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). P-MUC1C-ALLO1 is an allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy designed to target cancer cells expressing Mucin1 cell surface associated C-Terminal (MUC1-C) antigen. Additional participants will be treated with P-MUC1C-ALLO1 at the determined RP2D.

Following enrollment, subjects will be treated with P-MUC1C-ALLO1 and will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.
