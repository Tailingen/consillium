A Multicenter, Open-label Phase IIa Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of B1962 Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label Phase IIa clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of B1962 in the treatment of ad-vanced solid tumors.

The study consists of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Follow-up Period (EOT Visit, Safety Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up).

Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria at screening will enter the appropriate study co-hort according to tumor type and receive B1962 until unacceptable toxicity, radiographic disease progression, or withdrawal of the sub-ject for other reasons, whichever comes first, for a maximum of 24 months of treatment. Enrollment will be conducted according to three stages: Stage I: It is planned to enroll 5 patients in each of 8 cohorts (tumor type) to observe the safety and efficacy; Stage II: 1 \~ 2 cohorts are preferred to enroll 15 \~ 20 patients to observe the ef-ficacy and safety; Stage III: 1 cohort is finally preferred to continue enrollment until a total of no more than 60 patients are observed in this cohort to observe the efficacy and safety.
