This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. Two groups of patients will be enrolled, 36 in each group. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose- related safety.
