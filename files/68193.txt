New Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers for HPV-associated Oropharyngeal Cancer
The study involves the coexistence of a retrospective part, in which a group of patients with HPV-associated OPC for whom follow-up data of at least 2 years after diagnosis are available, designed in order to evaluate the expression of HPV16-specific E5 transcript as well as that of pEGFR and HLA, and a multicenter prospective part, involving the enrollment of a control group, enrolled at the ENT outpatient clinic of the IRE and the outpatient clinics of the relevant LILT provincial committees, to better elucidate the role of HPV16-E5 in identifying potentially transforming infections due to the presence of HPV.
PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS|Evaluation of HPV-specific E5 Transcript Expression in a Cohort of Patients With HPV-associated OPC|HPV 16 Positive Oropharyngeal Tumors (OPC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HPV-ASSOCIATED OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER
Presence of specific mRNA for the E5 oncoprotein in HPV-associated OPC samples, The expected results concern the identification of OPC subgroups correlated with the expression of HPV16 E5.RNA will be extracted from FFPE with a commercial RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed into cDNA.

The synthesized cDNA will be subjected to real-time PCR with specific primers, already designed by the Beacon Design software (BioRad) to include the splicing site (880-3358) of the specific E5 transcript.

The relative amount of genes will be determined by the ΔΔCt method normalized to housekeeping genes., Sample collection period: 6 months Total duration of the study: 12 months
Presence of specific mRNA for the E5 oncoprotein in HPV-associated OPC samples, the primary outcome is necessary for a subsequent larger study in which the expression of E5 will be evaluated together with that of EGFR and HLA and associated with prognosis and different responses to therapy, Sample collection period: 6 months Total duration of the study: 12 months
