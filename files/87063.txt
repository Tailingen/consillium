A Phase I Clinical Study of Oral CP-4126 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumour
At step 1, patients with advanced solid tumors will receive CP-4126 capsules following a dose escalation schedule until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. At step 2, 20 patients will be randomized. They will receive at days 1 and 8 in a double cross design either oral CP-4126 at the recommended dose or gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 intravenously. At both steps, the schedule of treatment will be day 1, 8, 15 q4w until complete response or disease worsening/ progressing. All further treatment at step 2 will be oral CP-4126.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: CP-4126|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Step 1: MTD of oral CP-4126 in patients with advanced solid tumours, followed by establishing the recommended dose, 6 months|Step 2: Pharmacokinetic parameters comparison of oral CP-4126 with IV gemcitabine, 12 months
Tolerability of oral CP-4126, 12 months|Biovailability of oral CP-4126, 12 months|Preliminary assessment of antitumor activity of oral CP-4126, 18 months
This is a multicentre clinical study conducted in Belgium and in The Netherlands. The study is a phase I divided in 2 steps: The first step is a dose escalation to define the RD. At the second step the PK profile of oral CP-4126 will be compared with the PK profile of IV gemcitabine. In addition, the study is conducted to characterize the tolerability of oral CP-4126, to evaluate its bioavailability, and to make a preliminary assessment of antitumor activity in patients with solid tumours.
