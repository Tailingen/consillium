Safety assessment, throughout the study|dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), assessed for individual patients from C1D1 to C1D28 during the dose escalation portion of the protocol, until maximum tolerated dose is identified|determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), during dose escalation portion of the protocol. Three to six subjects are treated at a specified dose level. If deemed safe dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose is identified
Efficacy based on duration of response and time to progression based on assessment, measured every 8 weeks throughout the study
