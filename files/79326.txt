BIOLOGICAL: infusion of JY231 injection
Objective Response Rate, Metric/method of measurement:IWG-2（2007）《Revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma》, Month1、Month2、Month3、Month6、Month9、Month12
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-treatment clinical study. In this study, approximately 10-20 adult and elderly patients with CD19-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma will be enrolled for JY231 infusion therapy. The safety of JY231 was evaluated by observing adverse events after cell therapy. Evaluate the effectiveness of JY231 treatment compared to the results of the subjects' own previous standard treatment regimens or base data. Blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid were collected before and 12 months after the JY231 infusion to detection.
