Study For Evaluating The Value Of A Multi Biomarker Approach In Metastatic GEP NETs
This exploratory study aims to evaluate the diagnostic, prognostic and response predictive value of a multi biomarker strategy in patients with Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (GEP NETs) originating from the midgut or pancreas. Using a recently developed methodology enabling the evaluation of 92 concomitant cancer biomarkers will provide an interesting approach to solve this question (Lundberg et al 2011).
Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
OTHER: This is a non-interventional study. Patients will be treated with any intervention deemed appropriate by the patient's physician.
Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival, Up to 60 months
Change in oncological biomarker levels, Baseline visit and follow-up visit [i.e. every 3 months during the first year, every 6 months for the remainder of the study] up to 60 months
