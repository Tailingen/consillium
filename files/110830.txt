Hypofractionated Pencil-Beam Scanning Intensity-modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in Recurrent Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypofractionated IMPT for the reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent rectal cancer.
Recurrent Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Pencil-Beam Scanning Intensity-modulated Proton Therapy|DEVICE: MEVION S250i Hyperscan and Adaptive Aperture Proton Therapy Machine
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of reirradiation using hypofractionated IMPT, * MTD is defined as the dose associated with a 35% probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
* DLT is defined as any toxicity listed below that occurs within 6 months from start of treatment and is considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to proton reirradiation:

  * Any grade 5 toxicities
  * Any grade 4-5 GI toxicities
  * Bowel obstruction
  * Grade 3-5: diarrhea; anal, colonic, or bowel ulcers; bladder perforation; any fistula formations; peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy of the pelvis above baseline; osteonecrosis/soft tissue necrosis; radiation dermatitis; hematuria; hematochezia; bowel/pelvic hemorrhage; reproductive tract toxicity
* Toxicity will be graded using CTCAE v5, Through 6 months from start of treatment for all participants enrolled (estimated to be 55 months)
Clinical complete response rate, -DRE, endoscopy, and cross sectional imaging will be used to measure clinical complete response rate, Within 6 weeks to 3 months post-completion of radiation therapy (estimated to be 7 weeks to 3 months and 1 week))|Median freedom from locoregional progression (FFLP), -Defined as time from end of radiation therapy to date of first instance of local or regional tumor progression, At 12 months post-radiation therapy (estimated to be 12 months and 1 week)|Median overall survival (OS), At 12 months post-radiation therapy (estimated to be 12 months and 1 week)|Median progression-free survival (PFS), -Defined as time from end of radiation therapy to the earliest date of locoregional progression, distant progression, or death from any cause, At 12 months post-radiation therapy (estimated to be 12 months and 1 week)|Change in quality of life as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30, -The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of a 30-question questionnaire, which assesses patient well-being with five functional scales (the physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social, and global). It also includes three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and six single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, diarrhea, constipation, and financial impact). Single-item QL scores for overall physical condition (question 29), overall quality of life (question 30), and the global and social functioning scales have been shown to be prognostic for overall survival in adult patients with advanced malignancies, Prior to start of radiation therapy, 1-2 weeks post radiation therapy, 3 months post radiation therapy, 6 months post radiation therapy, 9 months post radiation therapy and 12 months post radiation therapy|Change in quality of life as measured by the EORTC QLQ-CR29, -The QLQ-CR29 contains 29 questions, including items in 4 scales (urinary frequency, blood/mucus in stools, stool frequency, body image) and 19 single items (urinary incontinence, dysuria, abdominal pain, buttock pain, bloating, dry mouth, hair loss, taste, anxiety, weight, flatulence, fecal incontinence, sore skin, embarrassment, stoma care problems, sexual interest for men, sexual interest for women, impotence, dyspareunia). There are 11 items allocated for specific sub-populations, including males, females, and stoma patients. Scores of the QLQ-CR29 can be linearly transformed to provide a score from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher levels of functioning on the functional scales, greater degrees of symptomatology on the symptom scales and improved QOL on the global QOL scale, Prior to start of radiation therapy, 1-2 weeks post radiation therapy, 3 months post radiation therapy, 6 months post radiation therapy, 9 months post radiation therapy and 12 months post radiation therapy|Frequency of acute adverse events as measured by CTCAE v 5.0, From start of treatment through 3 months after completion of radiation therapy (estimated to be 3 months and 1 week)|Frequency of late adverse events as measured by CTCAE v 5.0, From 3 month post-completion of radiation therapy to 12 months post-completion of radiation therapy
The purpose of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypofractionated IMPT for the reirradiation of locoregionally recurrent rectal cancer.
