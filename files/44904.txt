Quantitative Bowel Readiness Assessment System in Predicting the Missed Detection Rate of Adenomas
To verify the correlation between the proposed artificial intelligence based bowel preparation assessment system and the missed detection rate of adenomas, and to evaluate whether the system can effectively assist doctors in identifying patients who need to be re-examined by colonoscopy due to poor intestinal cleanliness.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Bowel readiness
Missed detection rate of ≥5mm adenoma, (≥ 5mm adenoma missed rate, ≥ 5mm AMR) : Each patient will receive two colonoscopy examinations. The ≥ 5mm adenoma that were not detected in the first colonoscopy was define as missed ≥ 5mm adenoma. Numerator is the number of missed detection of ≥5mm adenomas during colonoscopy, and denominator is the total number of ≥ 5mm adenomas receiving colonoscopy., 6 months
