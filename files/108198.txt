ARTEMIS-003: HS-20093 in Patients With Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and Advanced Solid Tumors
HS-20093 is a fully humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which specifically binds to B7-H3, a target wildly expressed on solid tumor cells. The objectives of this study are to investigate the anti-tumor activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of HS-20093 in Chinese patients with metastasis Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.

This is a phase 2, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) of HS-20093 as a monotherapy in subjects with metastasis castration resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) and other solid tumors.

Incidence and severity of AEs are assessed according to vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram, etc., From the first dose through 90 days post end of treatment.|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-20093., Cmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20093 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of HS-20093 following the first dose., Tmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20093 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Terminal half-life (T1/2) of HS-20093 following the first dose., Apparent terminal half-life is the time measured for the concentration to decrease by one half. Terminal half-life calculated by natural log 2 divided by λz., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to last sampling time (AUC0-t) following the first dose of HS-20093., Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last sampling time when the concentration was no less than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). AUC0-t was calculated according to the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).|Percentage of participants with antibodies to HS-20093 in serum, Serum samples were collected for the determination of anti-drug antibody (ADA) at designated time points., From pre-dose to 90 days post end of treatment.|ORR determined by Independent review committee (IRC), Cohort 1(mCRPC): Objective response rate (ORR) determined by IRC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) Cohort 2(Other advanced solid tumors)：Objective response rate (ORR) determined by IRC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks)\]., From the first dose up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response (DoR) determined by investigators and IRC according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3, DoR is defined as the period from the first occurrence of CR or PR to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. If no PD or death after CR/PR, the cut-off date of progression-free survival (PFS) would be used \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks)\]., From the first dose up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR) determined by investigators and IRC according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). DCR was evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of CR, PR and stable disease (SD) \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks); SD shall be assessed at least 5 weeks after the first dose\]., From the first dose up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by investigators and IRC according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). PFS is defined as the time from first dose or random assignment (if any) to PD or death from any cause., From the first dose or random assignment up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) determined by investigators and IRC according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3, The rPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progressive disease (PD) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From the first dose or random assignment up to disease progression, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose or random assignment (if any) to death from any cause., From the first dose or random assignment up to death or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Prostate-specific Cancer Antigen (PSA) response rate, PSA response is defined as a ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline with PSA confirmation ≥ 3 weeks after the first documented reduction in PSA of ≥ 50%., From the first dose or random assignment up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.|Time to PSA progression, In participants with a decrease in PSA from baseline: ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir value, which is confirmed by a consecutive second value obtained ≥ 3 weeks later. In participants with no decrease in PSA from baseline: ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the baseline value after 12 weeks., From the first dose or random assignment up to disease progression or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
This is a phase 2, open-label, multi-center study consisting of two parts: Phase 2a and 2b.

Phase 2a: The study will be conducted in the following two cohorts: Cohort 1: Patients with metastasis castration resistant prostate cancers who have progressed on or intolerant to standard therapies. Cohort 2: Other patients with advanced solid tumor if they have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, or no standard or available curative therapy exists. All subjects will receive 8 mg/kg of HS-20093.

Phase 2b: The study will be conducted in patients with metastasis castration resistant prostate cancers who have progressed on or intolerant to standard therapies. Subjects will receive 8 mg/kg of HS-20093.

All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of HS-20093. Subjects will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression if the product is well tolerated and sustained clinical benefit exists.
