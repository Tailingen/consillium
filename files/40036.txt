Trial of BDC-1001 +/- Pertuzumab in Subjects With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of BDC-1001 administered as a single agent and in combination with pertuzumab in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (EnhertuÂ®).

Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive BDC-1001 as a single agent or BDC-1001 in combination with pertuzumab. Within each treatment arm, a Simon 2-stage design will be applied. Subjects will receive study treatment (i.e., BDC-1001 or BDC-1001 in combination with pertuzumab) for up to 24 months after Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal for any reason.

Bolt amended the protocol to transition any subjects still receiving BDC-1001 to continue receiving BDC-1001 in the Maintenance Phase. Subjects remaining on BDC-1001 will continue to receive BDC-1001 until a criterion for discontinuation has been met.
