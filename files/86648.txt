Effect of Geriatric Intervention in Frail Elderly Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Colorectal Cancer
GERICO is a randomized, controlled prospective trial. The aim is to investigate if frail, elderly patients with stage II-IV colorectal cancer, will profit from full comprehensive geriatric assessment and intervention before and during treatment with chemotherapy.

The hypotheses are: Optimizing the health conditions and functional status of frail elderly patients who suffers from stage II-IV colorectal cancer, with geriatric intervention will lead to a higher grade of completing the planned chemotherapy and at higher dose intensity. This will also result in a higher overall survival and improve quality of life.
