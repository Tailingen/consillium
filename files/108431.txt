Mean Change From Baseline in Total Number of Treated Mild Lesions Per Side at Week 12, The number of lesions is assessed at baseline (before treatment) and 12 weeks later.

The difference in lesions is recorded for each patient. The mean of disappeared lesions are then calculated for all patients., Baseline and Week 12
Pain Assesment, Pain assesment with a VAS Pain scale

The scale is anchored by "no pain" (score of 0) and "pain as bad as it could be" or "worst imaginable pain" (score of 10)., at inclusion (after treatment)|Lesions Disappearance Rate at 1 Months From Baseline., The number of lesions is assessed at baseline (before treatment) and 1 month later.

The difference in lesions is recorded for each patient. The rate is the quotient: " difference in lesions between baseline and at 1 month "/nubmer of lesions at baseline, 0(baseline),1 month|Lesions Disappearance Rate at 6 Months From Baseline., The number of lesions is assessed at baseline (before treatment) and 6 month later.
