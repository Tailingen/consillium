A Study of FF-10850 Topotecan Liposome Injection in Advanced Solid Tumors Including Merkel Cell Carcinoma
To determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FF-10850 (topotecan liposome injection) in patients with advanced solid tumors including Merkel Cell Carcinoma

Determine incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 4 years|Identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of FF-10850, DLT is defined as any adverse event at least possibly related to FF-10850, and meeting specified DLT criteria, 4 years|Determine maximun tolerated dose (MTD) of FF-10850, MTD is defined as the next lower dose of a cohort where patients experienced a DLT, 4 years|Determine recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) FF-10850, The highest dose level below the dose level eliciting DLT in â‰¥ 2 patients will be declared the MTD. The RP2D will be chosen based on the MTD or on PK and biological activity if an MTD has not been determined., 4 years

Dose-escalation Phase: Approximately 48 patients are planned for the dose-escalation phase, with at least 6 patients treated at the RP2D.

Cohort Expansion Phase: Two additional cohorts are planned. Cohort E1: advanced ovarian cancer and Cohort E5 Merkel cell carcinoma. Each cohort will be treated at the RP2D.

In each cohort, FF-10850 will be administered intravenously (IV) until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable AEs, or, after discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor, changes in the patient's condition that prevent further study participation. A sufficient number of cohorts will be enrolled to identify the RP2D.

There will be 3 initial dose levels in this study. FF-10850 will be diluted and infused over 60 minutes.

Approximately 96 patients are planned for the entire trial.

It is anticipated that approximately 4 centers will participate in the dose-escalation phase, with an expansion to approximately 10 centers in the cohort expansion phase. Accrual for the dose-escalation and expansion phases is expected to be approximately 3 years, with patients followed every 3 months from the last dose of study treatment to assess survival.
