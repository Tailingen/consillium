Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecological malignancy，just less than endometrial cancer and cervical cancer. Because most patients with advanced ovarian cancer can not get the ideal tumor cell reduction surgery, and multi-drug resistance often emerges after repeated chemotherapy，recurrent and metastatic ovarian cancer has become one of the major diseases that threaten women's health. There is strongly necessary to explore effective therapeutic drugs and means to improve prognosis of these patients and improve the quality of life. The study，as a double blind clinical trial ,is to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer,who has received second-line chemotherapy regimens and failed. A total of 60 patients with performance status 0-2 were enrolled in this study, and were randomly divided into two groups--one group of 40 patients receiving apatinib，and another of 20 patients receiving placebo.
