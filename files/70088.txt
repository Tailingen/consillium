Incidence of complications, The primary endpoint was the incidence of procedural complications between Day 0 and Day 30., 30 days
This is an observational, prospective, open, non-comparative (single arm), bicentric study.

This study is aimed at patients with prostate cancer for whom an ambulatory laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has been validated at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. The possibility of performing this procedure on an outpatient basis is left to the surgeon's discretion, according to well-defined medical procedure criteria.

This cohort is part of the usual care. The study will observe the incidence and describe the type, number, severity, duration and frequency of procedure-related complications that may arise in the first month post-op of ambulatory Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy. For this reason, patient follow-up will stop at 1 month after surgery, during a routine follow-up visit.
