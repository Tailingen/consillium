An Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of IMC-20D7S In Participants With Malignant Melanoma
A dose-escalation study designed to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), anti-melanoma activity, antibody blood levels and progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with malignant melanoma receiving IMC-20D7S either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IMC-20D7S, The MTD was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment Cycle 1. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or above toxicity that emerged during study treatment and was clearly not attributable to malignant melanoma or co-medication and was possibly, probably, or definitely related to IMC-20D7S in the judgment of the investigator. No DLT was observed in the study; a provisional MTD was established., Baseline to toxicity [up to end of Cycle 1 (4 or 6-week cycles)]|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Other Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs), or Death, A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Baseline through 30 days post last dose (up to 31 weeks)
IMC-20D7S Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax), A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 hours (h) post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|IMC-20D7S PK: Minimal Concentration (Cmin), A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 h post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|IMC-20D7S PK: Half-life (tÂ½), A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 h post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|IMC-20D7S PK: Clearance (Cl), A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 h post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|IMC-20D7S PK: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 h post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|IMC-20D7S PK: Volume of Distribution (Vd) at Steady State, A non-validated assay was used to determine individual serum concentrations of IMC-20D7S. Thus, analyses of PK data were not conducted., Cycles 1 and 3: Prior to, immediately after, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 (Cycle 3 only), 96, 168, 240, and 336 h post first infusion. Cycles 2 and 4: Prior to and 1 h post first infusion.|Number of Participants Who Develop Antibodies Against IMC-20D7S (Immunogenicity), Planned analyses for immunogenicity were not completed. A decision was made not to develop a validated immunogenicity assay because of the exploratory nature of the study and the analyses., Prior to the first and second infusion in each cycle up to Cycle 7 (4- and 6-week cycles)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was determined for participants who went beyond their first disease assessment and completed at least 1 treatment beyond Week 1 of treatment Cycle 3., First dose to disease progression or death (up to 27 weeks)|Recommend Doses for Phase 2/3 Studies Based on MTD, It was decided for administrative reasons to discontinue dosing at the provisional MTD rather than progress to Phase 1b., Baseline to toxicity [up to end of Cycle 1 (4-or 6-week cycles)]
