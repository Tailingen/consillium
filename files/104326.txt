Diagnosing Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Patients With Hematological Malignancies: A Multicentre Prospective Evaluation of an Aspergillus PCR Assay and a Galactomannan ELISA in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples
Diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a challenge in patients (pts) with hematological malignancies. The clinical significance of testing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples both with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) ELISA is unclear, and the BAL cutoff for GM has not been clearly defined yet. Using a validated nested PCR assay and a GM ELISA, we prospectively examine BAL samples from hematological patients at high risk of PA.
Invasive Aspergillosis
Clinical significance of biomarker based diagnostic investigation in suspected invasive aspergillosis, up to 18 months
Evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic intervention concerning antifungal treatment with regard to outcome (overall survival, in months) of a fungal infection, up to 18 months
