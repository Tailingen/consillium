Prognostic Role of Free Psa Ratio at Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Treatments for Prostate Cancer
Measurement of Free PSA ratio in patients after definitive radical treatment for prostate cancer, and assessment of whether post-treatment free PSA ratio can function as a biomarker for advanced disease in prostate cancer patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Free PSA ratio test in patients after definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer
Metastasis free survival, Rate of Metastasis correlated to the first post-treatment free PSA ratio, From date of diagnosis to date of Metastasis development, assessed up to 200 months
Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) free survival, Rate of CRPC correlated to the first post-treatment free PSA ratio, From date of Diagnosis to date of CRPC development, assessed up to 200 months|Cancer specific survival, Rate of Cancer specific survival correlated to the first post-treatment free PSA ratio, From date of diagnosis to date of cancer specific death, assessed up to 200 months
Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) circulates mostly in complex with protease inhibitors, but 10-30% circulates as inactive free-PSA (FPSA). In patients with prostate cancer (PCa), pretreatment FPSA is lower and used to risk-stratify patients for biopsy. However, posttreatment FPSA ratio (FPSAR) is rarely quantified, with an unexplored clinical value.

Methods The institutional database was queried to identify patients following radical prostatectomy (RP cohort) or radiotherapy (RT cohort) between 2000 and 2017. For validation, the investigators identified an independent prospective cohort with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP, using biobank samples (biobank cohort). All patients had at least one posttreatment FPSAR test. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to compare the metastasis-free (MFS), castration-resistant PCa (CRPC)-free, and cancer-specific-survival (CSS) rates. Multivariable Cox models determined the association between posttreatment FPSAR, metastases, and CRPC.
