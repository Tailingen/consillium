1.5T Intraoperative MR Imaging in Craniopharyngiomas
Purpose of this study is to investigate whether intraoperative imaging using a 1.5T MRI in craniopharyngioma surgery is useful in order to increase the rate of complete tumor removal.
Craniopharyngioma
OTHER: Intraoperative imaging using 1.5T MRI
Rate of additional tumor removal, Number of patients in whom non suspected tumor remants were indicated by intraoperative MRI and remnants could be removed completely thereafter. Results have to be confirmed in 1st follow up imaging., up to 3-4 months following surgery|Rate of achievement of intended extent of removal, It is examined whether the extent of tumor removal defined prior to surgery was achieved, up to three months following surgery|Diagnostic reliability, false positive or negative interpretation of intraoperative imaging determined after follow-up imaging 3 - 4 months following surgery, within 3 -4 months following surgery
Surgical complication, Rate of new deficits following surgery (excluding new endocrine deficits), within 1st week following surgery
Purpose of this study is to investigate whether intraoperative imaging using a 1.5T MRI in craniopharyngioma surgery is useful in order to increase the rate of complete tumor removal.
