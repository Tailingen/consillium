Determine the accuracy of AVB-620 imaging data to distinguish between malignant and nonmalignant tissues., Determine the accuracy of AVB-620 in correlating image-identified malignant breast or lymph node tissue with pathology findings in breast cancer patients., 1 month
Safety of AVB-620 as assessed by incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values., Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single AVB-620 infusion in women undergoing breast cancer surgery., 1 month|Identify malignant tissue types that provide the most robust fluorescence response compared to non-malignant tissue., Measure fluorescence intensity differences between malignant and non-malignant tissue to identify best responding tissue type., 1 month|Evaluate timing of AVB-620 administration on optical fluorescence characteristics, Further evaluate the effect of the timing of AVB-620 administration on the optical fluorescence characteristics, 1 month
Evaluate imaging techniques and conditions, Evaluate the impact of changes in intraoperative imaging techniques and conditions in distinguishing malignant from nonmalignant tissue compared to pathological assessment., 1 month|Evaluate methods for image analysis and display, Evaluate and refine methods and criteria by which images are analyzed and displayed, 1 month|Evaluate breast cancer patient suitability for AVB-620 imaging, Evaluate which breast cancer patients are most suitable for AVB-620 imaging, 1 month|Determine re-excision rates, Determine the planned and actual re-excision rates within 4 weeks after AVB-620 administration., 4 weeks
Phase 2, open-label study of AVB-620 in women with primary, nonrecurrent, nonmetastatic breast cancer undergoing either a lumpectomy with simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), or a mastectomy and simultaneous ALND. AVB-620 is a synthetic protease-activated peptide dye conjugate administered intravenously for the fluorescence detection and localization of potentially malignant tissue in primary tumor, tumor margins, or lymph nodes. A fluorescence image will be displayed on a monitor and will assist the surgeon to assess potentially cancerous tissue within the primary tumor site, tumor margins, or in lymph nodes which drain the primary tumor site.

Eligible patients will receive a single dose of AVB-620 by IV infusion up to 24 hours prior to breast surgery.

The study will evaluate the effect of timing of AVB-620 administration relative to surgery on the fluorescence and the accuracy of the AVB-620 imaging data to distinguish between malignant and nonmalignant tissues.
