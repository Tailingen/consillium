A Clinical Trial of LBL-024 Combination Drug in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours[Substudy 01(NSCLC)]
An open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LBL-024 in combination with other drugs for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumour.
Advanced Solid Tumour
DRUG: LBL-024 for Injection|DRUG: Docetaxel Injection|DRUG: Bevacizumab Injection|DRUG: Pemetrexed Disodium for Injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel Injection|DRUG: Carboplatin Injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), refers to the percentage of study subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)
Disease Control Rate(DCR）, Percentage of participants achieving CR and PR and stable disease (SD)., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Duration of Response(DOR）, The period from the participants first achieving CR or PR to disease progression., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Cmax, Maximum drug concentration in plasma after administration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Tmax, After administration,Time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)
This trial is an open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical study of LBL-024 combination therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LBL-024 combination therapy .The trial includes two cohorts.

Cohort 1：Non-squamous NSCLC with progression after receiving PD- (L) 1 combined with platinum-based chemotherapy.

This cohort will have a safety run-in period in which a small number of subjects will be enrolled to receive LBL-024 in combination with bevacizumab and docetaxel. After the subjects completed the 21-day safety observation, the sponsor and investigator jointly assessed the safety and tolerability of the combination drugs. If the sponsor and investigator assess the safety and tolerability of the combination drugs to be good, the trial will continue to enroll subjects for the extension study of combination administration. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to Arm A or Arm B.

Cohort 2: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior systemic therapy and are PD-L1 negative (TPS \< 1%).

This cohort was divided into Group A and Group B. Group A will enroll patients with non-squamous NSCLC.Group B will enroll patients with squamous NSCLC.

This study will enroll up to 210 subjects.
