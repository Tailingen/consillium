Study of hALK.CAR T Cells for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory High-risk Neuroblastoma
This Phase 1/2 trial aims to determine the safety and feasibility of administration of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the human Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) receptor in pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma (NB).

The trial will be conducted in two phases:

Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous hALK.CAR T cells using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Phase 2 will be an expansion phase to determine rates of response to hALK.CAR T cells.
Relapsed Neuroblastoma|Refractory Neuroblastoma|High-risk Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous hALK.CAR T cells
Phase 1: Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of hALK.CAR T cells, The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of hALK.CAR T cells will be determined by measuring the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) following administration of the hALK.CAR T cell product using a 3+3 dose escalation design., 5 years|Phase 1: Evaluate Manufacturing Feasibility of hALK.CAR T cells, Manufacturing feasibility will be evaluated as the proportion of patients undergoing leukapheresis who achieve manufacturing of a hALK.CAR T cell product that meets release criteria., 5 years|Phase 2: Estimate Response Rates, The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates per revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) of subjects with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma who are treated with hALK.CAR T cells will be estimated., Up to 5 years
Phase 1: Estimate Response Rates, The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates per revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) of subjects with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma who are treated with hALK.CAR T cells in the Phase 1 cohort will be estimated., 5 years|Estimate Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival, To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of subjects with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma who are treated with hALK.CAR T cells., 5 years|Evaluate Patient-Reported Symptoms, Patient-reported symptoms of interest (including mood, gastrointestinal and pain symptoms) will be measured in subjects treated with hALK.CAR T cells using the Ped-PRO-CTCAE v.1 inventory prior to and until 2 years after hALK.CAR T cell infusion, Up to 5 years|Persistence of hALK.CAR T cells, Persistence of hALK.CAR T cells will be measured by Polymerase Chain Reaction (or flow cytometry) analysis to detect and quantify survival of hALK.CAR T cells in the peripheral blood over time., Up to 5 years|Cytokine levels in the peripheral blood, Activity of hALK.CAR T cells will be assessed by measuring cytokine levels in the peripheral blood over time, 5 years
This study consists of two phases. The primary objectives of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are:

Phase 1:

* To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous hALK.CAR T cells, and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in participants with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.
* To evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing autologous hALK.CAR T cells.

Phase 2:

To estimate the complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates per revised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) of participants with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma who are treated with hALK.CAR T cells.
