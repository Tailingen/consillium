Application of CfDNA Methylation Detection in Auxiliary Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to construct an auxiliary diagnostic model for breast cancer by methylation markers. The study will collect blood and tissue samples from participants with breast cancer and benign disease for whole-genome methylation sequencing. It will screen methylation markers and develop a methylation auxiliary diagnosis model to distinguish between breast cancer and non-cancer.
Breast Cancer Screening
Establish DNA methylation profiles of two populations by collecting tissues and peripheral blood related to benign and malignant breast nodules., 12 months|Based on DNA methylation profiles, systematically evaluate the signal, noise, and complementarity of methylation biomarkers and ultimately form a set of diagnostic biomarker combinations for breast malignant nodules., 12 months|Further develop a methylation assisted diagnostic model that can effectively distinguish between benign and malignant breast nodules., 12 months
Evaluate the contribution and performance of methylation assisted diagnostic models by integrating imaging and methylation assisted diagnostic model results, and clarify the specificity and sensitivity of integrated model diagnosis., 12 months
