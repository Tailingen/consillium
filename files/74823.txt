A Study of an MMSET Inhibitor in Patients with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
A Phase I study to evaluate the safety of a novel, orally available, selective, and potent small molecule inhibitor of the histone lysine methyl transferase MMSET (also known as NSD2/WHSC1) to prevent the dimethylation of H3K36 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in adult patients with RRMM.

In the dose escalation phase (Part A), patients will be evaluated for DLTs during Cycle 1 (28 days). The KTX-1001 MTD, RP2D, and schedule will be determined.

In the dose expansion phase (Part B), patients with t(4;14) will receive KTX-1001 at the RP2D alone and in combination with SOC therapy (dexamethasone, carfilzomib or pomalidomide) to further define safety and tolerability and provide preliminary efficacy information.
