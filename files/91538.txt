Toripalimab or Placebo as Adjuvant Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radical Resection
This study will investigate if Toripalimab (A PD-1 Inhibitor) will improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to placebo in participants with HCC and are at high risk of recurrence after complete resection with no residual of tumour.
