Pilot Study of Veliparib (ABT-888) and Lapatinib (Tykerb) in Patients With Metastatic, Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of two drugs, Veliparib and Lapatinib, given to participants with metastatic triple negative breast cancer that have undergone previous treatment. Veliparib is an investigational drug and has not been approved by the FDA while Lapatinib has been approved by the FDA for another type of breast cancer. All eligible participants will receive the study medications and not a placebo.
Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Combination of Veliparib + Lapatinib
Number of subjects experiencing study-related toxicities when taking Veliparib in Combination with Lapatinib, Drug related toxicities for the safety analysis are defined as: a) any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity except alopecia and nausea which is not refractory to anti-emetics; b) failure to recover to baseline (except alopecia) after delaying the next dose by more than 14 days; c) grade 3 or 4 neutropenia complicated by fever equal to or greater than 38.50 degrees C or infection, or grade 4 neutropenia of a least 7 days duration; or d) grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage. Toxicity evaluation of the patients enrolled in the trial will be done using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria., baseline to 4 years
Number of subjects with objective response rate (ORR) at 4 years post baseline (Complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs], Complete responses plus partial responses will be included as indicators of an objective response rates., 4 years post baseline|Number of subjects with progression free survival (PFS) at 4 years after start of study., Number of subjects who survive to 4 years with no disease progression, Baseline to 4 years|DNA methylation and RNA transcriptome will be evaluated before and after therapy; baseline pattern will be compared with the post treatment pattern to identify markers of response or resistance., Analysis of the genomic data from tumors may allow us to identify if there is a gene or groups of genes that will be able to predict response or resistance to the research combination; in order to conduct the genomic evaluation it is necessary to correlate with clinical response. In addition, we will conduct IHC studies in order to analyze markers that will indicate us if the combination of the research agents inhibit the targets for which they were designed (H2AX, BRCA and EGFR); this data needs to be correlated with clinical data to see if the lab evaluations correlate with the response of the patient. In addition, we will evaluate by IHC markers of apoptosis that will indicate us if the combination of research agents was cytotoxic against the tumor cells ; this data needs to be correlated with clinical data to see if the lab evaluations correlate with the response of the patient., Within 4 weeks of baseline (treatment initiation)|Measure numbers of circulating tumor cells before and after therapy, Circulating tumor cells will be measured before and after therapy and will indicate if the therapy is active against the tumor; a decrease in the number of the circulating tumor cells will indicate effectiveness of the combination., Before and during Cycle 1 (consisting of 28 days)|Peak Plasma concentration of Veliparib and Palatinib when given in combination., Blood samples for the first day will be collected 5 minutes before the start of therapy, 30 and 60 minutes after the first dose of Lapatinib and then 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the start of Lapatinib. On day 2, Lapatinib and Veliparib will be given and samples will be taken 30 and 60 minutes after the first dose and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours. Additional blood samples will be taken on day 3, before the third day dose of the combined study drugs. The same schema will be followed on days 8, 9, and 10.

Each pharmacokinetic variable will be divided by dose groups for descriptive statistical analyses (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum per dose group)., Throughout Cycle 1 up to day 10|Measure level of the M30 before and after therapy, Serum levels of the apoptosis protein M30 will be measured before and after therapy and will indicate if the therapy is active against the tumor; an increase in the level of M30 will indicate effectiveness of the combination., baseline to cycle 1
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women. Metastatic breast cancer remains incurable partially due to the lack of targeted therapy for selected subsets of patients. There are five distinct subsets of breast cancer with unique biological profiles. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset with special clinical interest because of its significant percentage of occurrence (10-20% of all breast cancer diagnoses) and its poor prognosis. With no defined targeted therapy to date, this study seeks to investigate a therapeutic strategy based on specific molecular abnormalities in the tumor cells of TNBC.
