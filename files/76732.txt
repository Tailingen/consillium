The Use of Bioimpedance to Determine Pre-Clinical Lymphedema in the Post-Operative Breast Cancer Patient
Primary Objective: To determine whether early intervention (with garment sleeve and gauntlet) in patients with pre-clinical lymphedema can halt the progression of lymphedema.

Secondary Objectives:To evaluate whether bioimpedance is an accurate, reliable method to measure pre-clinical and clinical lymphedema.

Tertiary Objective: To determine whether bioimpedance analysis is better than the gold standard of volume displacement to measure lymphedema.

The successful completion of this study will address whether bioimpedance analysis is a reliable, accurate method to measure pre-clinical and clinical lymphedema. In addition, we intend to evaluate whether bioimpedance analysis is better than the gold standard of volume displacement for measuring lymphedema. And most importantly, we will evaluate whether a short trial of compression garments in women identified to have pre-clinical lymphedema can actually halt the progression of disease. Bryn Mawr Hospital would propose to publish the research and findings of this study, which may have future bearing on the post-operative therapeutic management of subjects with pre-clinical lymphedema following axillary surgery.
