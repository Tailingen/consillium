Study of DAC Combined With HAAG Regimen in Newly Diagnosed AML Patients Older Than 60
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DAC combined with HAAG regimen in the induction treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients older than 60 years.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Induction Chemotherapy
DRUG: Decitabine, Homoharringtonine, Aclarubicin, Cytarabine and G-CSF
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR includes complete response (CR), CRi and PR. CR was defined as \< 5% bone marrow blasts in an aspirate with spicules, no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease, and independent of transfusions; CRi: was defined as\<5% bone marrow blasts, either ANC\<1×10\^9/L or platelets\<100×10\^9/L, transfusion independence but with persistence of cytopenia; PR was defined as decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5-25% in the bone marrow aspirate and the normalization of blood counts., Day 28-35 of induction course
Overall survival (OS), time from randomization to death from any cause, 3 years|Leukemia-free survival (LFS), time from randomization to the first relapse or death, 3 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), time from achievement of a remission to the first relapse, 3 years|Number of adverse events, adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0., 2 years
This is a phase 3, open Label, single arm, multi-center study in elderly newly diagnosed AML patients. The patients will receive DAC combined with HAAG in the induction treatment.
