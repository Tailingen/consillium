Irinotecan Liposomes Combined with Temozolomide and Vincristine in the Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Solid Tumors
A prospective, single-center Ia/Ib clinical study divided into two parts, including Phase Ia Dose Exploration and Phase Phase Ib Extension Phase.
Solid Tumor Cancer
DRUG: Liposomal irinotecan in combination with vincristine and temozolomide
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of liposomal irinotecan in combination with temozolomide and vincristine in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric solid tumors, 6 months
Incidence of adverse events, Use NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 for classification and grading, 1 year|Objective Response Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, 1 year
Phase Ia dose exploration phase:

Using a "3+3" study design, 15-30 eligible subjects will receive irinotecan liposome. Five dose groups of irinotecan liposome 40 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, 65 mg/m2, 80 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 will be pre-determined for a 21-day cycle. The dose of liposomal irinotecan will be gradually increased from the low dose group to the high dose group, and DLT will be observed during the dosing cycle.The same subject will receive only one dose of liposomal irinotecan during the study period. All subjects will complete relevant protocol-specified investigations during the course of treatment to observe safety and initial efficacy.

Phase Ib Expansion Phase:

Based on the results of the Phase Ia dose-climbing phase, the Phase Ib study will be conducted at the RP dose of irinotecan liposomes, and all subjects will complete the relevant examinations specified in the protocol during treatment to observe safety, preliminary efficacy, and so on.
