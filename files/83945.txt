Study of NY-ESO-1 TCR-T in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a kind of solid tumor with high heterogeneity. There is no standard second-line treatment plan for patients who have failed first-line treatment. NY-ESO-1, a cancer testis antigen, is highly expressed in soft tissue tumors and is an ideal therapeutic target.

Investigators aim to testify the safety and efficacy of NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell in advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1 TCR-T
AE/SAE, adverse events/ sever adverse events, from infusion to 30 days after infusion
ORR, overall response rate, From admission to the end of follow up, up to 2 years.
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a kind of solid tumor with high heterogeneity. The treatment of STS is complex and challenging, and surgery is still the main treatment method at present. For patients who are inoperable or advanced, medical treatment should be considered, mainly including chemotherapy and targeted treatment. At present, there is no standard second-line treatment plan for patients who failed first-line treatment.

NY-ESO-1, a cancer testis antigen, is highly expressed in soft tissue tumors and is an ideal therapeutic target.
