Topical Timolol Gel for the Treatment of Infantile Hemangiomas
We plan to conduct a study, to see how safe and effective timolol maleate 0.5% gel-forming solution is for infantile hemangiomas (IH) and the response of hemangiomas to timolol maleate 0.5% . Our hypothesis is that timolol will inhibit and possibly reverse growth of appropriate infantile hemangiomas.
Hemangioma
DRUG: timolol maleate 0.5% gel
Change in size of hemangioma, At each visit, the size of the IH is assessed in three dimensions (length, width, and height) in cm., Baseline, week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16|Change in color of hemangioma, At each visit, the color intensity (e.g., barely perceptible; pale pink or mottled pink/red; red with central pallor; dull red; bright red) of the IH is assessed on a 6 point scale., Baseline, week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16
Measure the extent of systemic absorption and the factors which influence absorption, A heel stick blood sample is collected to assess for systemic absorption., week 2
Subjects will be assigned to open label timolol maleate 0.5%. Parents will be instructed to place 1 to 2 drops twice a day in the center of the hemangioma. Subjects are expected to use the study drug as directed every day for a 4 month period.

Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a total of 5 months. Physical exam, photographs to compare size and color intensity, and a scale of improvement will be completed at each visit. Parents will complete a quality of life questionnaire regarding their child's hemangioma and its impact on quality of life.

Subjects who have evidence of worsening would be removed from the study and transferred to the clinic for evaluation and treatment.
