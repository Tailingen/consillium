TORC1/2 Inhibitor MLN0128 and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma or Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of raptor/rictor-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (TORC1/2) inhibitor MLN0128 when given in combination with bevacizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, or a solid tumor that has spread and not responded to standard treatment. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the progression of tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined as follows:

1. Non-GBM Solid Tumors (Endometrial \& Ovarian Cancers) - using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) guideline (v.1.1):

   * Target Lesions: \>/= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
   * Non-Target Lesions: The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
2. GBM - Using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, any of the criteria below qualify for progression:

   * \>/= 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions on stable/increasing dose of corticosteroids

     * Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable/increasing dose of corticosteroids
     * Any new lesion

1. RECIST criteria v.1.1 (Endometrial \& Ovarian Cancers):

   * CR: Disappearance of all target \& non-target lesions (+ normalization of tumor marker level)
   * PR: \>/= 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (from baseline) \& no new lesions
2. RANO criteria (GBM patients):

   * CR:

     * Disappearance of all enhancing measurable \& non-measurable disease (sustained \>/= 4 wks)
     * No new lesions
     * No steroids (physiologic replacement doses only)
     * Stable or improved non-enhancing lesions

II. To perform archival tumor analysis for markers of dysregulated cell signaling that may predict response to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (expression by immunohistochemistry \[IHC\] and amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization \[FISH\]), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (expression by IHC and deletion by FISH), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT), p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP), p-mTOR and p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk) in patients with recurrent GBM.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MLN0128.

Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then annually thereafter.
