COVID-19 Immunogenicity of a Third Dose of mRNA-1273 Vaccine Among Cancer Patients
Investigators will evaluate the immunogenicity of a third dose of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among cancer patients receiving the recommended third vaccine dose
Covid19|SARS-CoV2 Infection
BIOLOGICAL: mRNA-1273
1. The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) 28 days post-dose 3, The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) up to study day 28 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 28 days|Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) 6 months post-dose 3, The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) up to study month 6 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 6 months|Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-GMT Ab 28 days post-dose 3, The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-GMT Ab up to study day 28 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 28 days|Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-GMT Ab 6 months post-dose 3, The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-GMT Ab up to study month 6 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 6 months|Level antibodies that block the binding of ACE2 to RBD antigens from 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 28 days post-dose 3, The level antibodies that block the binding of ACE2 to RBD antigens from 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern up to study day 28 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 28 days|Level antibodies that block the binding of ACE2 to RBD antigens from 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 6 months post-dose 3, The level antibodies that block the binding of ACE2 to RBD antigens from 10 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern up to study month 6 will be measured by specific neutralizing antibody and serum assays, 6 months
