Clinical and Translational Study of STA-9090
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad STA-9090 has on colorectal cancer. This is a phase II trial which tests both how well the drug works in fighting your cancer as well as any possible side effects it will have on the patient.

Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled growth. This growth is controlled in part by a series of proteins that are part of a growth pathway. Some of these proteins are destroyed by a protein called HSP90 and STA-9090 is a test drug which blocks one of the proteins that helps cancer grow. This study will also look at molecular markers that may affect how the cancer grows, and how it responds to treatment.
Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DRUG: STA-9090
To Determine Overall Objective Response., Patients with measurable disease will be evaluated using RECIST criteria for determination of response., every 8 weeks
