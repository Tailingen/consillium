Study of Pharmacologic Manipulation of AGE (Advanced Glycation Endproducts) Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to look at the effect that the study drug OPC has on AGE levels in patients with prostate cancer.

AGEs are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to see if Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex (OPC) has an effect on the AGE levels in your blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.
