Immune Biomarker Study for Salivary Gland Carcinoma
Aims of this study are analyses of tumor metabolome, tumor transcriptome and tumor proteome as well as of the immune infiltration, separated by histological entity. These data will subsequently be compared with the with the detailed immune status determined in the patient's peripheral blood and saliva using machine learning techniques, among others, to create a biomarker cluster for salivary gland tumors. These can be used in clinical routine.

In addition, the investigators would like to study a subset of patients from freshly resected tumor organoids from freshly resected tumor tissue according to already established methods in order to mechanistic investigations of prognostic parameters.

OTHER: Sampling
Observation of changes in an established immune matrix (intratumoral and systemic), Different immune cells and tumor cell markers will characterize immunological groups using cluster analysis. Immune matrix of patients assessed by liquid immune profile-based signature (LIPS) (acc. Zhou et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC), 2021) and Tumour Associated Lymphocytes (TAL)., Change of the immune matrix from baseline to the end of study period, up to 5 years|Longitudinal immunophenotyping of the patients: Detection of about 30 distinct immune cell (sub)types together with their activation markers during study period, The distribution of immune cells and messenger substances in the blood will be examined by means of immunophenotyping in order to add the systemic immune cell composition.

Flow cytometric assessment of the amount of circulating immune cell-distribution per milliliter whole blood according to the LIPS technique (Zhou et al. JITC 2021)., Change of the immunophenotyping from baseline to the end of study period, up to 5 years|Analysis of cytokines in peripheral blood and their change at certain points in the course of treatment, Electrochemiluminescent MULTI-ARRAY measurement of concentration (pg/ml whole blood) cytokines/chemoattractant cytokines in the serum/plasma of the patients according to the LIPS technique (Zhou et al. JITC 2021)., Change of the cytokine expression from baseline to the end of study period, up to 5 years|Analysis of patient's metabolic state, Mass-spectrometric untargeted metabolomic of patients serum/plasma to assess the change of metabolites (pg/ml whole blood) from baseline to end of radiotherapy., The analyses are conducted from baseline to the end of study period, up to 5 years|Analysis of patient's microbiomic state by examination of saliva, tumor and stool, 16S rRNA deep sequencing of microbiome in salvia, tumour and stool samples to assess the presence and relative distribution of microbiotes (Operational taxonomic units (OTUs))., The analyses are conducted from baseline to the end of study period, up to 5 years
