Evaluating the Use of Photodynamic Therapy to Treat Facial Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Situ (SCCis)
The goal of this clinical trial is to test how safe and effective it is to treat early form of cancer cells found in the upper skin layer of the face, using a light-sensitive gel used in combination with a light source.

The main questions this trial aims to answer are:

* to confirm using laboratory testing, how much of the affected facial skin cancer section the treatment was able to remove, and;
* seeing how many participants had no remaining affected facial skin cancer sections after treatment.

Participants who qualify will be asked to complete 14 visits in total and will receive a total of two treatments, after voluntarily consent has been given.
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride 10% topical gel with Red Light
Number of participants with histological clearance of treated SCCis lesion., Histological clearance is defined as the absence of detectable evidence of SCCis tumor cell nests by the central pathology reports, an average of 12 weeks
Number of participants with clinical clearance of treated SCCis lesion, Complete Clinical Clearance will be measured by the Investigator and is defined as when there is no clinically visible lesion remaining at the site, an average of 12 weeks|Size of the lesion, Changes noted in the size of the treated SCCis lesion site, measured by the longest diameter., Up to 16 weeks|Local Skin Response Scale, Observations and changes noted in the aesthetic appearance (Erythema, Flaking/Scaling, Crusting, Swelling, Vesiculation/ Pustulation, Erosion/ Ulceration) of thetreated isSCC lesion will each be graded on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 as no presenceand 4 as a severe outcome., Up to 16 weeks
In the study, participants will be asked to complete the following:

* Provide basic personal information (including date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity)
* Provide their medical/ surgical history and perform a medical exam (including but not limited to symptom-directed physical exam, skin type, vital signs, height, weight and urine pregnancy test collection)
* Follow study rules such as avoiding certain medications and treatments
* Provide information on any medications, treatments or reactions that started after the study began
* Allow two treatments on the skin cancer area of the face using a light-sensitive cream used in combination with a light source
* Allow clinical documentation of the treatment, such as how well the treatment was tolerated, any skin reaction or side effects
* Allow surgery to remove the skin cancer area from the face for Laboratory testing

To qualify for this trial, participants must:

* be an adult (18 years of age or older)
* give voluntary written consent
* have a recently diagnosed (less than six months from first visit) skin cancer area on the face that meets surgery size requirements
* be willing to follow study instructions and complete study requirements, including not using non-approved lotions and creams on the treatments areas
* allow photographs of the area of skin cancer being treated on the face
* (if female) not be pregnant before and during the study and agree to use acceptable forms of birth control
* confirm they are not sensitive to any of the study treatment ingredients

All surgery samples collected from the participants towards the end of the study will be sent to a laboratory for testing. All photographs of the treatment area collected during the study will be used as study data.

All participants have the right to refuse further participation in the study at any time.
