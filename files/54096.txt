Safety & Efficacy of Consolidative Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Boosting Residual Lung Cancer With Durvalumab
This study is designed to determine if combining consolidative radiation therapy (RT) using a hypofractionated regimen (hfRT) (2 fractions) for boosting the residual primary lung cancer with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy concurrently is safe and will provide better tumor control locoregionally and distantly than either modality alone.

Evaluate the safety of combining hfRT and durvalumab by Adverse event assessed, Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed during the entire course of study, 2 years|Evaluate progression free survival (PFS) when combining hfRT with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy (durvalumab), based on assessments according to RECIST 1.1, 12-month
Progression Free survival (PFS) when combining hfRT with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy, PFS based on assessments according to RECIST 1.1a, 18 months|Overall Survival hfRT and adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy, Overall Survival when combining hfRT with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy, 12 months
For safety reasons, consolidative hfRT will start from 6.5Gy x 2 fractions and dose escalate to 10Gy x 2 fractions in a 3+3 design. Consolidative hfRT will be delivered one to two months after finishing definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT) and concurrently with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy using durvalumab in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

At the final determined consolidative hfRT dose level, a total of thirty-two subjects with pathologically documented stage III NSCLC treated with dCRT will be enrolled for data analyses.

Follow-up assessments will occur every 3 months during durvalumab therapy for the first two years, then every 4-6 months after 2 years from study registration until confirmed disease progression or death. Primary endpoints include the safety of boost hfRT and concurrent anti-PD-L1 therapy adjuvantly following dCRT, and the 12-month progression-free survival to compare with historical results.
