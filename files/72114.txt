CD147 Targeting Nanobody Probe for PET Imaging in Solid Tumors
The objective of the study is to construct a noninvasive approach using 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-NB147 PET/CT to detect the CD147 expression of tumor lesions in patients with Solid tumors and to identify patients benefiting from CD147 targeting treatment.

DRUG: 18F-FDG
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, SUV is a semi-quantitative analysis index to describe the radioactive uptake of lesions, which has certain reference value for differentiating benign and malignant lesions。 The uptake of the tracer （68Ga-NOTA-MAL-NB147） in solid tumor lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 2 years
