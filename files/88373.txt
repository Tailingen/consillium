Multi Centre Trial of DSMM for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma up to 60 Years
The study is evaluating whether risk-stratification by the means of a chromosomal aberration provides a tool to discriminate between standard and high risk. Risk-adapted therapy is based on allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for high-risk subjects instead of a second autograft in patients with deletion of chromosome 13 who have an HLA-identical stem cell donor available.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: allogeneic stem cell transplant
Response rate after high-dose therapy, one year
Response rate and treatment-related mortality after allogeneic transplantation, one year
The DSMM V protocol is to compare a consolidation treatment for standard-risk patients not displaying del(13) at initial diagnosis following two cycles of high-dose melphalan 200 mg/mÂ² each supported by autologous stem cell retransfusion with interferon versus PEG-interferon. Patients with del(13) are screened for availability of a fully HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. If patient's informed consent is obtained additionally, he is scheduled to undergo an allogeneic SCT following the first cycle of high-dose melphalan. All other subjects are to proceed to a second course of high-dose melphalan similar to the standard-risk group. Initial cytoreduction is foreseen with four cycles of anthracycline-dexamethasone combination followed by combination therapy with ifosfamide/epirubicine/etoposide for stem-cell collection.
