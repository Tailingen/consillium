Selinexor Combined With BEAM for ASCT in R/R DLBCL With MYC Positive
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor combined with BEAM pretreatment regimen in ASCT of recurrent and refractory DLBCL patients with immunohistochemical positive for MYC
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: selinexor combined with BEAM regimen|DRUG: BEAM regimen
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from an cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Complete remission rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on 2014 Lugano criteria., 3 months after the transplantation|The time of hematopoietic reconstruction, The first day of neutrophils ≥0.5×109/L for 3 consecutive days was the time of successful implantation of granulocytes. Platelet ≥20.0×109/L for 7 consecutive days and the first day after platelet infusion was considered as the successful time of megakaryocytes implantation., 2 months after the transplantation|Transplantation-related adverse reactions, Transplantation-related adverse reactions are any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which is related to ASCT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)
This trial included 82 patients, who were randomly divided into pre-treatment with selinexor combined with BEAM regimen (experimental group) or BEAM regimen (control group) according to 1:1, and then underwent ASCT therapy. The trial included a screening period, a treatment period (2 weeks before and after transplantation), and a follow-up period (2 years after autologous transplantation). At 3, 6, 9 and 18 months after ASCT, blood routine, blood biochemistry, B-ultrasound of liver, bile, pancreas, spleen and lymph node, and whole body enhanced CT were performed. At 1 and 2 years after ASCT, blood routine, blood biochemistry, and whole body PET-CT evaluation were performed until the end of the study.
