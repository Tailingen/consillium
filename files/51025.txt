Immunoreactivity to Cetuximab in Cancer Patients
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory may help doctors predict which patients will develop hypersensitivity to cetuximab.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at hypersensitivity to cetuximab in patients with head and neck cancer or advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with cetuximab.
Colorectal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: immunologic technique|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Identification of antibodies (e.g., IgE, IgG, IgA, and IgM) against cetuximab, Until all samples are collected.
OBJECTIVES:

* To examine serum samples from patients with head and neck cancer or advanced colorectal cancer previously treated with cetuximab for the presence of antibodies against cetuximab.

OUTLINE: Serum samples are examined by immunoreactivity screening of IgE, IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies and complement reaction.
