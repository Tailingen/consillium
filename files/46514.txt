Clinical Study of CWP232291 in Relapsed or Refractory Myeloma Patients
This is a Phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, two-part study in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM:

* Phase 1a: single agent CWP232291. Dose-finding followed by cohort expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose as determined by the Safety Review Committee (SRC).
* Phase 1b: CWP232291 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Dose-finding followed by cohort expansion at the combination therapy MTD or optimal dose as determined by the SRC.
