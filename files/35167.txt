Nanoliposomal Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin Plus Capecitabine As Conversion Therapy of Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has gained acceptance in treating locally advanced breast cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and rectal cancer. However, the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer is still in the exploratory stage. The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of nanoliposomal irinotecan and oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine as a novel conversion therapy for locally advanced colorectal cancer patients.

After patients are enrolled, they will receive a modified FOLFOXIRI regimen (nanoliposomal irinotecan 60mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, and capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily, day 1 to 7), repeated every two weeks. The efficacy and resectability were evaluated every four cycles. Patients who had lesions that were radically resectable after evaluation will receive surgery. This medication will be administrated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or resectability or up to a maximum of 12 cycles.
