A Study of APG-2575 in Combination With Azacitidine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability, efficacy and PK of APG-2575 in combination with Azacitidine in the patients with AML/MPAL or MDS/CMML. The study consists of dose escalation (Part I) and dose expansion phase (Part II)
AML, Adult
DRUG: APG 2575 ramp up arm
DLT, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate at each dose level

DLT will be assessed within the first 28-day cycle of study treatment via CTCAE version 5.0, 28 days
The patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML/MPAL/CMML or relapsed/refractory Higher-Risk MDS by WHO classification for which no available standard therapies are indicated or anticipated to result in a durable response will be enrolled.

This will be a 3+3 dose escalation to determine the DLTs and MTD/RP2D of APG-2575 (see dose escalation table) given in combination with Azacitidine
