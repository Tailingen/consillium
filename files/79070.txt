Evaluation of 18F-DCFBC PSMA-based PET Imaging for Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This research is being done to see if an investigational radioactive drug called 18F-DCFBC can help us find cancer that has spread (metastatic disease) from its original site in people who have cancer in their prostate to other parts of their body.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 18F-DCFBC
Measurement of Sensitivity of DCFBC-PET as Determined by Agreement of PET/CT Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer With Conventional Imaging Modality (CIM), Measurement of sensitivity of DCFBC PET to CIM (contrast-enhanced CT and bone scintigraphy) for detection of metastatic prostate cancer based on number of lesions that are detected on PET/CT, in agreement with CT and CIM. Measurement of sensitivity were obtained on lesion by lesion analysis where lesions that responded on follow up were considered a true positive., 24 Months
Sensitivity of Detection of New or Progression of Metastasis, Sensitivity of DCFBC-PET and conventional imaging modalities (CIM), which include bone scintigraphy (BS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to detect new or progression of metastases at follow-up, where "equivocal" lesions are considered negative. Measurement of sensitivity were obtained on lesion by lesion analysis where lesions that responded on follow up were considered a true positive, therefore, sensitivity is a proportion of responsive lesions to the total number of lesions analyzed., up to 1 year
The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), \[18F\]DCFBC (DCFBC) PET imaging for detection of metastatic prostate cancer. PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. The investigators propose to assess the ability of DCFBC PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by visual qualitative and quantitative SUV analysis. Correlation will be made to sites of suspected metastatic disease detected by standard conventional imaging modalities (CIM) for prostate cancer which includes IV contrast CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone scintigraphy.
