Adults patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or IBI303, given subcutaneously (SC), in the 24-week double-blind (DB) phase. Randomized participants received one SC injection of the appropriate DB study medication (adalimumab 40 mg or IBI303) at Week 0 and then eow until Week 22. A follow-up visit occurred 70 days(Week 32) after the last dose of study drug to obtain information on any ongoing or new adverse events (AEs).
