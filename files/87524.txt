Chemotherapy With or Without Dalteparin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Anticoagulants, such as dalteparin, may help prevent blood clots from forming in patients being treated with chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective when given alone or together with dalteparin and/or capecitabine in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying whether dalteparin prevents blood clots in patients with pancreatic cancer receiving treatment with different combinations of gemcitabine and capecitabine.
Chemotherapeutic Agent Toxicity|Pancreatic Cancer|Thromboembolism
DRUG: dalt√©parine|DRUG: Chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion
Thromboembolic events, number of thromboembolic events during anticoagulation treatment, during study treatment
Progression-free survival, at 6 months|Overall survival, at one year|Tolerance of regimens, each cycle
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To demonstrate that preventive anticoagulation with dalteparin reduces the number of thromboembolic events.
* To determine the number of thromboembolic events occurring with preventive anticoagulation.

Secondary

* To determine survival without thrombotic event.
* To determine progression-free and overall survival.
* To determine time to response of tumor.
* To assess tolerance of these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center and WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm A: Patients receive chemotherapy at investigator's discretion
* Arm B Patients receive chemotherapy at investigator's discretion and dalteparin In all arms, treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Blood and plasma samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study. Blood is examined for biomarkers, resistance to activated protein C, and mutations (Leiden V factor, mutation G20210A, and the factor II gene). Thrombin generation and factors VIIa and VIII are assessed in plasma.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
