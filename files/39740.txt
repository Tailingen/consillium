Neoadjuvant Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab for Newly Diagnosed Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor
The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab prior to standard therapy (surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy) in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and newly diagnosed pre-malignant and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) for whom surgery for resection of tumor is indicated.
