HPV Self-testing in Transgender Individuals
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that spreads through skin-to-skin contact. Some HPV types can cause changes in cells that lead to cancer and are known as 'high-risk' HPV (hrHPV). hrHPV is linked to cancers of the cervix (opening of the womb), throat, and anus (exit of the bowel).

It is not known if transgender people (individuals whose gender identity does not align with their sex assigned at birth) are at increased risk of hrHPV or cancers caused by hrHPV compared to cisgender people (individuals whose gender identity does align with their birth sex). There is also little knowledge about HPV in the vagina for transgender women who have surgery to make one.

Transgender men may be at higher risk of cervical cancer than cisgender women because they are less likely to go for screening. This can be because of physical discomfort and emotional distress during screening when a swab is taken directly from the cervix.

The investigators seek to examine how common hrHPV is in transgender people in different parts of the body. In the study, participants will take swabs from the vagina and anus, a urine sample, and use mouthwash. Transgender men will also have an extra swab taken by a clinician as part of routine cervical screening. This is to see if the swab from the vagina is as good as the one from the cervix for finding cells that might lead to cancer. Participants will also take an online survey to measure the acceptability of self-sampling compared to clinician sampling.

This research can inform HPV prevalence and decision-making about HPV screening among transgender people.
