Letrozole in Women With Advanced Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor Positive Uterine Leiomyosarcoma
The purpose of this research study is to determine if letrozole is effective at controlling the growth or spread of estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive uterine leiomyosarcoma. This drug has been used in research studies for other cancers and is currently approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer. Because letrozole lowers hormone levels in the body, it may be helpful to control tumors that express hormone receptors ( ER/PR).
