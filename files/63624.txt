Irreversible Electroporation (NanoKnife) for the Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The aim of the study is to evaluate the use of irreversible electroporation in the treatment of locally advanced cancers of the head of pancreas with vascular spread. This technique would allow to treat the unresectable part of the tumor to make it more accessible for a secondary surgery.
