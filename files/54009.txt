Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy Evluation in Gastric Cancer Patients Based on Circulating Exosomal LncRNA-GC1
The investigators hope that through the analysis and research to find determine whether lncRNA-GC1 could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for monitoring the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy response for personalized medicine for gastric cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Detection of levels of circulating EV-derived lncRNA-GC1
Detection of levels of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1, Levels of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 are detected by RT-PCR, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The LncRNA-GC1could noninvasively track dynamics of tumor burden and has been proposed as a real-time biomarker that can provide both predictive and prognostic values. But the value in monitoring the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy response is unclear. The investigators hope that through the analysis and research to find determine whether lncRNA-GC1 could serve as a monitoring biomarker for patients with gastric cancer receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
