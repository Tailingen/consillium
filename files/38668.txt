Capecitabine and 131I-huA33 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether it is safe to treat patients with advanced colorectal cancer, with humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine (131I-huA33) in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine).
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: 131I-huA33 (131-Iodine on humanised monoclonal antibody A33)
Number of Patients With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). DLT was defined as any of the following related events:

Any grade 2 or greater allergic reaction related to huA33. Any grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicity related to 131I-huA33 or capecitabine.

* These toxicities included palmar plantar erythema, but skin rash thought to be related to huA33 protein was not a DLT as previous studies have shown no relation of this toxicity to dose of huA33 or radioiodine dose.
* Capecitabine cardiotoxicity grade ≥ 3 - including vasospasm, acute coronary syndrome and arrhythmia, necessitated the cessation of study drug in the affected patient but were not considered DLT as these are recognized as idiosyncratic in nature and not known to be related to capecitabine dose.

Any grade ≥ 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days in duration or any thrombocytopenia with a platelet count \< 10 x 10\^9/L., 7 weeks
Number of Patients With Tumour Response Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Tumor responses were evaluated using appropriate imaging and categorized according to RECIST at Screening (within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment), and at week 13. Per RECIST, target lesions are categorized as follows: complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; stable disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria (Therasse et al 2000)., 13 weeks|Biodistribution of 131I-huA33 Measured by Whole Body Clearance and Normal Organ Clearance Reported as Mean Biological Half-life (T1/2 Biological) After Initial 131I-huA33 Infusion, T1/2 biological is the clearance of the isotope from the whole body. Following the initial 131I-huA33 infusion, gamma camera scans were acquired over a 1 week period (1-4 hours, Day 1, Day 2 or 3, and Day 4 or 5). Whole body clearance, or biological half time, T1/2 biological, was calculated from the whole body anterior and posterior planar images. A region of interest (ROI) was calculated to encompass the whole body, and for each ROI at each time point, the mean counts per pixel per minute was normalised to imaging time point Day 1., 1 week|Mean Specific Absorbed Dose of 131I-huA33 for Normal Organs Calculated From the Initial Infusion, Gamma camera imaging with anterior and posterior whole body scans using conjugate view methodology were performed on four occasions (1-4 hours, Day 1, Day 2 or 3, and Day 4 or 5) following completion of the intravenous initial infusion.

Dosimetric analysis was performed on the series of gamma camera whole-body planar images acquired in all patients following the first infusion.

Organ radioactivity content was estimated from the geometric mean of anterior and posterior regions of interest counts. The counts for each organ were corrected for background using regions of interest drawn adjacent to each organ where whole body thickness was comparable., 1 week|Mean Total Tumor Dose of 131I-huA33, Gamma camera imaging were performed on four occasions (1-4 hours, Day 1, Day 2 or 3, and Day 4 or 5) following completion of the initial infusion and 7+2 days post-therapy infusion in week 2, and again in week 3 or 4 and week 5 following the therapy infusion.

Dosimetry analysis was performed on the series of gamma camera whole-body planar images.

Tumor radioactivity content after the initial infusion was estimated from the geometric mean of anterior and posterior regions of interest counts. The counts for each organ were corrected for background using regions of interest drawn adjacent to each tumor. Resultant counts were converted to activity using a camera sensitivity factor calculated from a gamma camera standard of known activity which was scanned at the same time., 5 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of 131I-huA33 as Measured by T½α and T½β (Half Lives of the Initial and Terminal Phases of Disposition, Respectively), Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) were drawn in week 0 immediately pre-initial 131I-huA33 infusion; then 5 minutes, 60 minutes and 2 hours post-initial 131I-huA33 infusion, Day 1, Day 2 or Day 3, Day 4 or Day 5.

This clinical trial tests the combination of humanised A33 monoclonal antibody tagged with radioactive iodine 131 (131I-huA33) together with capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

When colorectal cancer has spread to other organs, it is generally considered incurable but with a limited number of treatment options. Colorectal cancer cells express proteins on their surface known as antigens, and one of these is called the A33 antigen. An antibody which targets the A33 antigen was initially developed in the mouse and found to bind to human colorectal cancer cells. Because humans developed immune reactions when given the mouse antibody, an antibody, which is more like normal human antibodies, was developed (humanised A33 antibody). In order to increase its effectiveness, radioactive iodine (131I) has been attached to the antibody so that the antibody can deliver radiation directly to colorectal cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that both the unlabelled humanised A33 antibody as well as the humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine can be administered safely to humans with no major allergic reactions. The addition of chemotherapy to radiolabelled 131I-huA33 may result in a treatment that is more effective for the treatment of colorectal cancer than either agent alone.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to give humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine together with chemotherapy. Different dose levels of radioactive iodine attached to a constant dose of antibody will be given together with a fixed total daily capecitabine chemotherapy dose. Providing humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine and chemotherapy is tolerated well without major side effects, the dose of capecitabine chemotherapy given with 131I-huA33 will also be increased in order to determine the highest dose that can be given safely in combination with radio-labelled 131I-huA33. The effectiveness of the treatment combination against advanced colorectal cancer will also be assessed.

Patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have never previously received chemotherapy using capecitabine may be eligible to participate in the study. A total of between 15 and 30 patients are expected to be recruited.

Screening blood tests will be performed to determine eligibility, as well as baseline heart and lung function tests and appropriate scans to measure tumour size and assess radiation within the body. Patients will be given a trace-labelled (small radiation dose) infusion of 131I-huA33 into a vein followed a week later by the treatment infusion of 131I-huA33. The first infusion will be given as an outpatient, but for the second, patients will be hospitalized and confined to a radiation-shielded room until radiation levels fall to safe limits. Oral iodine drops will also be given for 28 days in order to protect the thyroid gland from the effects of radioactive iodine. Capecitabine chemotherapy will be taken orally and will commence at the time of the treatment infusion. Each cycle of capecitabine chemotherapy involves the medication being taken twice per day for a total of 14 days followed by 7 days rest. A total of 4 cycles of capecitabine will be given after the treatment infusion.

Blood samples will be taken just before the treatment infusion and then weekly for 13 weeks. There will be weekly physical examinations until 9 weeks after the treatment infusion and again at 12 weeks. Total study duration is 13 weeks from the trace-labelled infusion of 131I-huA33, that is 12 weeks from the treatment infusion of 131I-huA33. Patients will only receive one treatment infusion of 131I-huA33 antibody.
