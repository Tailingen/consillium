Nilotinib Plus Pegylated Interferon-α2b in CML
The purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of switching CML patients, who have been treated with imatinib ≥ 2 years and who have stable detectable molecular residual disease between 0.01-1.0% (IS), to the combination of Nilotinib and PegIFN, in terms of the proportion of patients who achieve confirmed MR4.0.

the proportion of patients achieving confirmed MR4.0., An interim efficacy analysis will be prepared after 40 patients have completed 12 months study treatment.If already a sufficient number of patients have achieved the efficacy endpoint i.e. a 25% increase in MR4.0 rate (from 48% in ENEStcmr to 73% in this study). Using Fleming's method, we have indication of superior efficacy of the combination if 29 or more patients achieve MR4.0, and thereafter may stop inclusion in the study., 12 months
the number of patients experiencing grade 3 or more adverse events, A safety interim analysis by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) is planned after 15 patients have completed the Month 6 study assessment, i.e. after 3 months of the combination therapy. The study should be stopped if 4 out of 5, 6 out of 10 or 8 out of 15 patients experience grade 4 hematological toxicity, or grade 3 non hematological toxicity after 3 months of PegIFN treatment., 6 months|The proportion of patients who complete the planned 9 months of combination therapy with PegIFN (i.e. to Month 12 assessment)., An evaluation of the dose increase from 25 to 40 μg/week will be performed when 15 patients have passed the 9 month time point (i.e 3 months on 40 μg/week)., 12 months

Study phase: Phase II.

Patient population:

Patients with suboptimal molecular response or stable detectable molecular residual disease after ≥ 2 years of treatment with imatinib (i.e. BCR ABL level between 0.01% and 1% IS).

Study objective:

To assess the effect of switching CML patients, who have been treated with imatinib ≥ 2 years and who have stable detectable molecular residual disease between 0.01-1.0% (IS), to the combination of Nilotinib and PegIFN, in terms of the proportion of patients who achieve confirmed MR4.0.

Study design:

Single arm, open label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nilotinib 300 mg BID, alone and in combination with PegIFN 25 - 40 μg/week in patients not in CMR. Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300 mg BID at the beginning of the study to establish the tolerability before adding PegIFN. Combination treatment will be continued until Month 12, which is followed by monotherapy phase of nilotinib 300 mg BID. Overall study duration for the individual patient is 24 months.
