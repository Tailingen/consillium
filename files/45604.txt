A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Vitamin D on PFS in Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Despite strong evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with undesirable outcomes in patients with numerous cancers, there has never been a thorough study of vitamin D treatment in subjects undergoing treatment for cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether modification of vitamin D levels in the blood, through supplementation, can improve outcomes.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin D|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|OTHER: Placebo
Event Free Survival, Event free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from randomization to lack of response at week 13, initiation of a new treatment, disease progression defined by Lugano criteria, or death, right-censored by time of last follow-up. Per Lugano criteria, progression is defined as a new FDG-avid lesion or an increase in intensity from baseline, an increase by \>= 50% in lesion diameters, a new lymph node \> 1.5 cm in any axis or a new extranodal site \> 1.0 cm., 3 years
All-Cause Mortality, Number of participants who died from any cause between day 1 of treatment and the time of last follow-up., Participants were followed for survival beginning on day 1 of treatment until study closure with a maximum follow-up of 64 months.|Number of Participants With Treatment Response at 13 Weeks, Participants had imaging performed at week 13 to assess response to treatment. A response was defined as partial (PR) or complete response (CR) according to Lugano criteria. Per Lugano criteria for target lesions: PR includes reduced metabolic uptake or a ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the diameters compared to baseline. CR includes metabolic score of 1, 2 or 3 (out of 5) with or without residual mass or regression of target lesions to ≤ 1.5 cm in the longest dimension., 13 Weeks from the start of treatment
