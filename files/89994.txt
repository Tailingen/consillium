Prospective Study for Molecular Biomarkers of Normal Nasopharyngeal Tissue
The investigators collect nasopharyngeal epithelium samples from healthy individuals and analyze for biomarkers compared with tumor tissues from another clinical research project. The goal of this study is to identify molecular biomarkers for prediction of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
