Association Between Cell-free Nucleic Acid in Blood, Urine and Microbiome in Stool With Pancreatobiliary Cancer
Based on the cell free nucleic acid analysis information of blood samples, the results of microbiome and metabolite analysis of stool and urine samples of pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer patients, the clinical correlations of them with primary cancer are evaluated. And based on these information, biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of pancreatic and bile duct cancer are explored.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: cell free DNA in blood and urine, metabolite/microbiome in urine and stool
correlation of genetic mutation, concordance of genetic mutation between tissue and blood of treatment-naive status, the day of study enrollment or the day of tissue and blood acquisition|correlation of genetic mutation burden and prognosis, correlation of genetic mutation burden and prognosis, the day of study enrollment and follow-up till end of the study
correlation of metabolic change in urine metabolite and prognosis, analysis of correlation of metabolic change in urine metabolite and prognosis, the day of study enrollment and follow-up till end of the study|correlation of microbiome in stool and prognosis, analysis of correlation of microbiome in stool and prognosis, the day of study enrollment and follow-up till end of the study
