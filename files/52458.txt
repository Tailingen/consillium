Investigating Mindfulness and Music to Ease Radiation Side Effects in Prostate Cancer
In this study, the researchers will examine the implementation feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects of a brief eHealth mindfulness intervention, compared to brief relaxing music, to reduce self-reported symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance in a sample of localized prostate cancer patients during the receipt of radiation therapy.

Eligible patients will be recruited from Northwestern Medicine's Department of Radiation Oncology and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Participants will complete an online questionnaire prior to beginning the intervention. Following implementation pre-testing, the intervention will begin on Week 2 of radiation therapy and last 4 weeks. Upon arrival for their treatment visit, they will receive the audio program from the clinic staff. They will start the program prior to their treatment. Participants will be asked to listen to the audio-program during their radiation treatment visits, using a Bluetooth-enabled MP3 player with speaker instead of headphones or earbuds because they are not permitted during radiation therapy. The patient's ears need to be free to hear a possible communication from the radiation therapists if need be. Audio program recordings will run 3-12 minutes. Participants will turn off the program after their audio session has ended and return the audio program to the clinic staff after their treatment visit. Participants will complete an online question immediately after completing the intervention, and again 1 and 3 months later.
