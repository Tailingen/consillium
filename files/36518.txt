The difference in overall survival between the two groups calculated by Kaplan-Meier, Survival differences between the monotherapy and combination groups, 2021.7-2021.12|The difference of overall survival in patients receiving different doses of regorafenib, In the real world, regorafenib was used in different dosages: 40mg,80mg,120mg,160mg,respectively. The difference in overall survival time of patients with different dosage was compared., 2021.11-2021.12|Regorafenib in combination with other drugs, In the real world, regorafenib was used in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy or other drugs, and the frequency of occurrence of different conditions was analyzed., 2021.7-2021.10
Survival differences among the patients with different clinical phenotypes and genotypes, To compare the survival of patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma by gender, age, tumor site and other genotypes, 2021.7-2021.10
To analyze the real-world usage pattern, effectiveness and factors associated with the effectiveness of regorafenib in the treatment of patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma. This retrospective, observational study included clinicopathological and follow-up data of patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma who were treated with regorafenib from June 2017 to September 2020. Patients with incomplete data were excluded. Overall survival (OS) stratified by combination therapy with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, chemotherapy and regorafenib dose was calculated by Kaplan Meier method and log rank test. R software version 4.0 was used for the analysis.
