METIMMOX-2: Metastatic pMMR/MSS Colorectal Cancer - Shaping Anti-Tumor Immunity by Oxaliplatin
Hypothesis: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with DNA mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) function / microsatellite-stable (MSS) phenotype harbor a non-immunogenic disease that can be transformed into an immunogenic condition by short-course oxaliplatin-based therapy, and may achieve durable disease control or even tumor eradication by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade therapy to the standard-of-care oxaliplatin-based treatment.

Progression-free survival, To determine PFS, in terms of continuation of treatment strategy, of repeat sequential treatment with the Nordic FLOX regimen and nivolumab in patients with previously untreated unresectable metastatic pMMR/MSS colorectal cancer reaching 10% or higher target lesion reduction at the first radiologic restaging., From date of the first FLOX cycle until the date of disease progression on ongoing therapy or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months
Incidence of adverse events, Safety, From date of the first FLOX cycle until 100 days following discontinuation of the study treatment, assessed up to 60 months|Grading of adverse events, Tolerability, From date of the first FLOX cycle until 100 days following discontinuation of the study treatment, assessed up to 60 months|Objective response rate, ORR, Through study completion, an average of 18 months|Duration of response, DoR, From date of the best overall response until the date of disease progression, assessed up to 60 months|Secondary surgical curative-intent resection rate, SSCiR, Through study completion, an average of 18 months|Overall survival, OS, From date of the first FLOX cycle until the date of death, assessed up to 60 months
The study has a start-up single-arm design consisting of 2 cycles of the Nordic FLOX regimen followed by 2 cycles of nivolumab for a total of 4 individual cycles (8 weeks, or longer if cycles have been delayed) before radiologic response assessment and patient stratification to continued therapy.

Patients who present less than 10% target lesion reduction at the first radiologic response assessment will proceed to standard-of-care treatment at the Clinical Investigator's discretion. Patients will be followed for PFS (from the date of study enrolment).

Patients who present 10% or higher target lesion reduction at the first radiologic response assessment will continue treatment with alternating 2 cycles of the Nordic FLOX regimen and 2 cycles of nivolumab. From the time of stratification, radiologic response assessment will be every 8 weeks. After a total of 12 individual cycles (4 initial cycles followed by 8 continuation cycles; Sequence 1), patients will enter a break that will persist until disease progression, following radiologic assessment every 8 weeks during the break, when therapy is reintroduced and administered for another total of 12 individual cycles (Sequence 2) before a new break. This go-and-stop schedule will be continued until progressive disease on ongoing therapy (defining PFS), intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first.
