MVX-ONCO-1 in Patients With Solid Tumor
The objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of 6 vaccine doses of MVX-ONCO-1, administered sub-cutaneously (injections and capsules implantations), in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumor in progression who are not or not any longer amenable to any standard therapy of their tumour disease.
Solid Tumor|Cancer
OTHER: Treatment
Number of patients with Adverse Events and/or Serious Adverse Events, Adverse events will be followed carefully at each clinic visit by the Investigator, to determine their incidence, causality and severity., 18 weeks
Delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, Induction of a specific CD8 response, immune monitoring, 18 weeks|imaging and metabolic monitoring, 18 weeks|tumor size, document of tumor number, sites, size of lesions, 18 weeks|tumor pain, intensity, site, frequency of pain, use of analgesics, 18 weeks
Endpoints:

Primary: To assess safety parameters including adverse and serious adverse events (incidence, causality, severity), local and systemic tolerance to the administered study treatment, changes in laboratory values and vital signs in patients with solid tumor; Secondary: to measure some tumor responses in using imaging technique, serological tumor markers, immune monitoring and metabolic monitoring.
