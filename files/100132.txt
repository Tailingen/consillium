VinCaT: Vinorelbine, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab in Advanced Her-2 Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and safety of the combination of vinorelbine, carboplatin and trastuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy containing anthracyclines or taxanes has improved survival in patients with Her-2 positive metastatic breast cancer, but newer combinations with less toxicity and cross resistance are needed. Early clinical studies have suggested that the combination of vinorelbine, carboplatin and trastuzumab can be active against metastatic breast cancer, with less toxicity. In this phase II single center trial, 39 patients will be enrolled to evaluate the activity and safety of this combination.
