The Accuracy of Targeted Lymph Node Dissection of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients According to Predictive Models
Investigators combined the clinical and radiomics characteristics of resectable non-small cell lung cancer patients to construct an accurate model for preoperative prediction of mediastinal lymph node status. For the patients in the experimental group, lymph nodes will be dissected based on the predicted lymph node status by the model, while in the control group, the lymph nodes will be dissected according to the NCCN guidelines (2023). Investigators expect that performing lymph node dissection according to the predictive model can lead to better prognosis for patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Lymph node dissection based on the guidelines|PROCEDURE: Lymph node dissection based on the model
Consistency rate between preoperative prediction results and postoperative pathological results, Compare postoperative lymph node pathology results with preoperative prediction results, 1 week after surgery
Postoperative complications, Observation of complications within 30 days after surgery, 30 days after surgery|Postoperative recurrence rate, Observe for recurrence within 2 years after surgery, 2 years after surgery|Disease-free survival, Follow up after surgery to determine if there is any recurrence or metastasis, and calculate disease-free survival, 2 years after surgery|Overall survival, Follow up after surgery to determine if there is death, and calculate overall survival, 2 years after surgery|Intraoperative blood loss, Record intraoperative blood loss, During the surgery|Postoperative drainage volume, Record postoperative drainage volume, 2 weeks after surgery|Postoperative drainage time, Record the time from the end of the surgery to the removal of the drain tube, 2 weeks after surgery
Investigators combined the clinical and radiomics characteristics of resectable non-small cell lung cancer patients to construct an accurate model for preoperative prediction of mediastinal lymph node status. Investigators will randomly divide all enrolled patients into an experimental group and a control group. For the patients in the experimental group, lymph nodes will be dissected based on the predicted lymph node status by the model, while in the control group, the lymph nodes will be dissected according to the NCCN guidelines (2023). Investigators will calculate the consistency between preoperative prediction results and postoperative pathological results to verify the accuracy of the model. And investigators will evaluate the impact of this new lymph node dissection method on prognosis by comparing the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, disease-free survival, and overall survival between the two groups of patients. Investigators expect that performing lymph node dissection according to the predictive model can lead to better prognosis for patients.
