A Study to Evaluate KIN-2787 in Participants with BRAF And/or NRAS Mutation Positive Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of KIN-2787 in adults with BRAF/NRAS-mutated advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This is a two-part, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study in participants with BRAF mutation-positive and/or NRAS mutation-positive tumors designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KIN-2787, a RAF small molecule kinase inhibitor, to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KIN-2787, and to assess the objective response to KIN-2787 therapy alone and in combination with binimetinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor.

The dose expansion phase (Part B) will assess the safety and efficacy of KIN-2787 at the recommended dose and schedule in patients with cancers that contain BRAF Class I, II or III mutations, including lung cancer, melanoma, and other selected solid tumors.
