Change in provider knowledge with management of Quality of Life Concerns for CLL patients, as measured by survey, Baseline, 6 months|Change in provider confidence with management of Quality of Life Concerns for CLL patients, as measured by survey, Baseline, 6 months
This multifaceted initiative will include evaluating patient perspectives on their QoL, evaluating provider perspectives on managing QoL, and providing education to the whole CLL care team (hematologists/oncologists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses) on contemporary approaches for individualized, patient-centered management of CLL. Providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants will participate in educational initiatives geared towards enhancing their knowledge and confidence with managing QoL concerns for patients with CLL. Pre and post surveys will be conducted with providers to evaluate change in these areas. The project aims to train this team on how to enhance communication with patients and caregivers as a means to increase patient engagement in care and QoL in this population.
