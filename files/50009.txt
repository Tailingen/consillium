Circumferential Submucosal Incision Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Versus Conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection of Colonic Polyps
That Circumferential Submucosal Incision Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (CSI-EMR) will be at least as safe but more effective than conventional EMR for injection assisted EMR of large laterally spreading tumour and sessile polyps of the colon.

Efficacy of CSI EMR (Rates of en-bloc resection, recurrence rates), 3 months
The investigators have recently developed a new, and the investigators believe safer and more effective technique for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Utilising the new method the investigators make small cuts around the polyp to isolate it. Subsequently the Gelofusine solution is injected beneath the polyp and provides greater elevation. This allows us to improve the chance of removal of the entire polyp with one attempt in one piece. It is preferable to remove the polyp in one piece as it minimises the chance of leaving residual polyp tissue behind. Our team has recently completed an animal study comparing our newly developed technique to conventional EMR. The investigators have found significant improvements in our ability to completely remove the polyp in one attempt. There have also been recent studies overseas that have shown this new technique to be quite effective.
