Inferior Vena Cava Index in Patients Undergoing Liver Resection
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IVC index measured intraoperatively was affected by fluid administration and could add any helpful information about the hemodynamics during hepatic resection. In addition, the investigators evaluated whether IVC index was somehow correlated with the risk of postoperative complication.
