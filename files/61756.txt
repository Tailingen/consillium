Biomarkers of Liposomal Doxorubicin Induced Hypersensitivity Reaction in Breast Cancer Patients
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was an anthracycline nanomedicine to be approved for advanced breast cancer and other solid tumor therapy and showed a good disease control rate (57%). PLD could induce hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). There are about 9-25% patients got infusion reaction or HSR. Severe HSR could lead to allergic shock even presyncope or threat to life. To our knowledge, there were no sensitivity biomarker to predict the PLD induced HSR. And the mechanism of PLD induced HSR is unknown yet. Therefore, to analyze and discuss the biomarkers and mechanism of PLD induced HSR in advanced breast cancer, we design this prospective, observational, biomarker study.
