The Diagnostic Accuracy of Advanced Imaging in Identifying Suspected Skin Cancer (Basal Cell Carcinoma) Around the Eyes
The purpose is to investigate the diagnostic value (sensitivity and specificity) of dermal-Optical Coherence Tomography (D-OCT, VivoSight Dx), in patients with clinically suspected BCC lesions inside the periocular region and compare these results to previous reports using D-OCT in diagnosing lesions outside the periocular area.

The Hypotheses:

* The sensitivity and specificity of D-OCT in diagnosing BCC inside the periocular region is comparable to previous reports on BCC lesions outside the periocular region when the standard D-OCT probe is used.
* The sensitivity and specificity of D-OCT in diagnosing BCC inside the periocular region is increased when the customised D-OCT probe is used.
* The sensitivity and specificity of D-OCT in diagnosing periocular BCC is comparable to punch biopsy when both standard and the customised D-OCT probes are used.
* D-OCT with the 10 and 20-millimeter standoff is capable of subtyping periocular BCC.
* The inter-observer variation in diagnosing and sub-typing periocular BCC decreases with increasing experience in the scanning procedure.
* The number of scans to correctly interpret D-OCT decreases with increasing experience in the scanning procedure.
* Delineation of periocular BCC tumour extension is possible using both D-OCT probes
