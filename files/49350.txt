The Effects of Two Exercise Interventions on Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Cardiotoxic Chemotherapies
The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise preconditioning can mitigate the off target effects of chemotherapy treatment on measures of cardiovascular function, inflammatory responses, and quality of life.

BEHAVIORAL: High Intensity Interval Exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Moderate Intensity Walking
Subject Retention Percentage, This is a feasibility study designed to determine the extent to which eligible patients can be successfully recruited, randomized, and retained. Endpoint data will be used to justify and provide point estimates for a fully powered study. Retention will be measured as a percentage of those enrolled who complete the study interventions., 22 Weeks
VO2peak, Change in VO2peak (L/min) measured at pre-chemotherapy and post chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Global Longitudinal Strain, Global longitudinal strain (%) will be used to assess changes in cardiac contractile function and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Ejection Fraction, Ejection fraction (%) will be used to assess changes in cardiac contractile function and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Diastolic Function, E' and A' (cm/s) will be used to calculate the E'/A' ratio to assess for diastolic dysfunction and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Brachial Artery Endothelium-Dependent Flow-Mediated Dilation, Changes in endothelial function as measured by brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (%) at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity, Changes in arterial stiffness as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (m/s) at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Blood pressure, Brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg) will be measured at baseline and post-chemotherapy., 22 Weeks|Lipid panels, A lipid panel will be performed to measure total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, and low-density lipoprotein (mg/dl) to assess changes in cardiometabolic health at pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy, 22 Weeks|Inflammation/Immune cell concentrations in peripheral circulation., Various markers of inflammation and immune cells will be measured at baseline, pre-chemo (following exercise pre-conditioning), midway through patient's prescribed treatment, and post-intervention to determine changes., 22 Weeks
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women in the US and survivors experience long-term health effects of chemotherapy. Exercise training is an efficacious treatment for preserving functional capacity and has shown promise in mitigating cardiac toxicity of breast cancer chemotherapy. However, supervised exercise is not a practical solution for all breast cancer survivors, as medically monitored exercise facilities are poorly dispersed in the US and poorly utilized by cancer patients. To improve reach of these programs, remotely monitoring exercise sessions may be necessary. However, effects of remotely-monitored exercise conditioning before and during adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy on cardiotoxic outcomes are unknown. Our study aims to address this gap by testing the feasibility of two types of remotely-monitored exercise interventions, an exercise bicycle intervention compared to a brisk walking intervention, in 20 UVA Breast Cancer Clinic patients undergoing cardiotoxic chemotherapies. Remotely-monitored exercise training will start one week prior to chemotherapy (preconditioning) and continue throughout adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (which is typically 4 months in duration). Our multidisciplinary research team proposes four aims: 1) Determine the extent to which eligible patients can be successfully recruited, randomized, and retained; 2) Assess VO2peak, echocardiography derived left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular global longitudinal strain among these patients at baseline and at \~4 months; 3) Examine treatment engagement and intervention acceptability; and 4) Explore the relationship between engagement in the exercise training and psychosocial function.
