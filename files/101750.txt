Targeting CD19/CD20 Dual-targeted Cell in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A phase I, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LUCAR-G39P, a dual-targeted cell preparation targeting CD19/CD20, in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: LUCAR-G39P cells product
Incidence, severity and type of TEAEs, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Through study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Pharmacokinetics in peripheral blood, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood after LUCAR-G39P infusion, ThTrough study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Pharmacokinetics in bone marrow, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in bone marrow after LUCAR-G39P infusion., ThTrough study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for this cell therapy, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design and the DLTs occurring following CAR T-cell infusion, Within 30 days after LUCAR-G39P infusion
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LUCAR-G39P cell infusion, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Progression-free survival (PFS), rogression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LUCAR-G39P to the first documented disease progression (according to Lugano 2014) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LUCAR-G39P to death of the subject, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LUCAR-G39P to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for CR or PR, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Remission (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (CR or PR) to the first documented relapse evidence of the responders., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)|Immunogenicity assessment of LUCAR-G39P cells, The incidence of Anti- LUCAR-G39P antibody in patients who received LUCAR-G39P cells infusion, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39P infusion (Day 1)
his is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose extension study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LUCAR-G39P in the patient â‰¥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of LUCAR-G39P injection. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment, and follow-up.
