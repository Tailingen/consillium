Gastrointestinal Microbiome Study of Appendiceal Cancer
This study analyzes the gastrointestinal microbiome of appendiceal cancer patients with peritoneal spread scheduled to undergo cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). Participants will provide fecal samples pre- and post-operatively.

Determine whether the intestinal microbiome of patients with appendiceal tumors with peritoneal carcinomatosis differs from that of a healthy, age-matched cohort, Appendiceal cohort to healthy age-matched cohort, 36 months
Compare the gut microbiome of appendiceal tumors by histopathology, Low-grade and high-grade tumors, 36 months
Identify potential biomarkers associated with appendiceal tumors, Molecular profile, 36 months|Identify alterations in the gut microbiome post-CRS/HIPEC, Compare pre-HIPEC and post-HIPEC samples, 36 months
Analysis of the human microbiome is an attempt to define how changes in the human microbiome are associated with health or disease.

Eligible participants scheduled to undergo cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for appendiceal cancer will provide fecal samples pre- and post-operatively. Investigators will analyze potential changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome and make comparisons to an age-matched healthy sample.
