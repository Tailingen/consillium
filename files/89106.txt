Clinical Study on Raman Spectra of Blood, Saliva and Urine in Patients With Cancer Treated by Modern Therapy
Blood, saliva and urine samples of tumor patients on the day of admission and discharge were collected for Raman spectral analysis, which provided exploration for the prediction of efficacy, follow-up and prognosis according to the variation characteristics of Raman spectral.
