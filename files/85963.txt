An Open-Label Study of QD Oral Administration of Tivozanib (AV-951) in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a standard Phase 1b and 2a, multi-center, study design that will examine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of tivozanib (AV-951) with this dosing schedule, as well as overall response rate of tivozanib (AV-951) administration in NSCLC.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Tivozanib (AV-951)
Ph1b: To determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of tivozanib (AV-951) administered orally QD in subjects with NSCLC, 4 weeks (1 cycle)|Ph2a: To determine the ORR of tivozanib (AV-951) administered orally once daily in subjects with NSCLC with no prior anti-angiogenic therapy, 8 weeks (2 cycles)
Ph1b: To evaluate the PK of tivozanib (AV-951) administered orally QD, 8 weeks (2 cycles)|Ph1b: To evaluate the preliminary antineoplastic activity of tivozanib (AV-951) administered orally QD, 8 weeks (2 cycles)|Ph2a: To determine the duration of complete and partial responses and time to disease progression (TTP) for subjects treated with tivozanib (AV-951), 8 weeks (2 cycles)|Ph2a: To determine the safety and tolerability of tivozanib (AV-951) administered orally once a day, 4 weeks (1 cycle)
The Phase 2a portion of the study was not conducted
