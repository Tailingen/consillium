Phase I/II Study of KRN330 Plus Irinotecan in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The primary objective of the Phase II portion of this study is to assess the efficacy of KRN330 in combination with irinotecan after first-line or adjuvant FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin)/CapOx (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) treatment failure in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: KRN330|DRUG: Irinotecan
Number of Participants With Serious and Other (Non-Serious) Adverse Events According to the CTCAE v.3.0, Until disease progression, death, or withdrawal post initial KRN330 treatment, assessed up to 100 months
Phase II portion is an open-label, single arm study. Based on the results of the Phase I portion, weekly KRN330 (0.5 mg/kg) and biweekly irinotecan (180 mg/m2) will be used in the Phase II portion. To be eligible for the Phase II portion, a patient will have recurred or progressed within 6 months of the last cycle of FOLFOX/CapOx +/- bevacizumab (first-line or adjuvant regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer). Patients will continue the treatment until disease progression.

Per protocol, the decision was made to terminate the study based on interim analysis results. The Response Rate in Phase II did not meet the protocol-specified RR of 15% when 0.5 mg/kg KRN330 was administered weekly in combination with irinotecan(180 mg/m2)biweekly.
