S9427, Suramin in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Adrenocortical Cancer Incurable by Surgery

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of suramin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV adrenocortical cancer.
Adrenocortical Carcinoma
DRUG: suramin|DRUG: therapeutic hydrocortisone

Number and grade of adverse events, From date of registration until progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to four cycles
OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma treated with suramin. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this therapy.
