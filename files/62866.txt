BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T-cells|DRUG: Tocilizumab
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events will be graded according to the CTCAE v5.0, 1 month
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (CR+CRi+CRm), The proportion of patients with complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), complete molecular remission (CRm)., 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion|Overall survival (OS), The proportion of patients with overall survival, 1 year|Events free survival (EFS), Time from CAR-T cells infusion to CR failure, relapse, or death., 1 year|Leukemia free survival (LFS), Time from achievement of CR/CRi/CRm to the time of relapse, death in remission, or last follow-up., 1 year
Locally manufactured second generation autologous CD19 CAR-T cells are used for immunotherapy. Protocol treatment includes lymphodepleting conditioning (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide) followed by one CAR-T cells intravenous infusion with tocilizumab premedication.
