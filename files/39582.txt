A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Abiraterone in Participants With Prostate Cancer Who Have Received Docetaxel
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received docetaxel-based chemotherapy (treatment of disease, usually cancer, by chemical agents).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Prednisolone
Percentage of Participants Achieving Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response at Week 12, The PSA response will be evaluated according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criterion, which is, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline up to 12 weeks after the first dose of study drug, which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement that is at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA., Week 12
Percentage of Participants With Radiographic Objective Response, Percentage of participants with radiographic objective response is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response based on reconciled radiographic disease assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0. The CR is disappearance of all lesions. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 5 years|Duration of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, Duration of a PSA response is the time taken to achieve a PSA response that is decrease in PSA from Baseline by greater than or equal to 50 percent., Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants Achieving Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, The PSA response is decrease in PSA from Baseline by greater than or equal to 50 percent., Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle up to 5 years|Clinical Benefit, Clinical Benefit is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST Version 1.0. The CR is disappearance of all lesions. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. The SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease since treatment started., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle up to 5 years|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) Score, The ECOG PS score 0 versus 1, wherein 0 signifies fully active, able to carry all pre-disease performance without restriction and 1 signifies restriction in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work on a light or sedentary nature, for example, light housework, office work., Baseline, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1 and 2, and thereafter Day 1 and 15 of all cycles up to 5 years|Decline in Serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), Decrease in serum PSA according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criterion, which is, 25 percent increase in PSA and an absolute increase in PSA level by 2 nanogram per milliliter or more, from Baseline which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement that is at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA., Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval from the date of first dose to date of death., Every 3 months until death or up to 5 years|Prostate Specific Antigen Based Progression-Free Survival (PSA-PFS), The PSA-PFS is defined as time to first PSA failure that is, two consecutive increases in PSA of 50 percent and greater than or equal to 5 nanogram per milliliter or death as per Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criterion., Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 5 years|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (RAD-PFS), The RAD-PFS is defined as time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression or death due to any cause. RAD-PFS will be evaluated according to RECIST Version 1.0., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression, or up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants With Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Conversion, The CTC is the pharmacodynamic potential predictive biomarker for tumor sensitivity., Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, and 4
This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm study to investigate safety and efficacy of abiraterone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (consists of 14 days before study commences on Day -1); Treatment phase (consists of 28-daily dosing cycles wherein abiraterone 1000 milligram \[mg\] once daily and 5 mg prednisolone twice daily will be given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed); and Follow-up phase (up to 5 years or until survival after the first dose of study drug). Abiraterone will be administered orally daily as at least 1 hour before the meal or 2 hours after the meal. Dose reduction will be allowed at the Investigator's discretion but not lower than 500 mg per day. Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression unless, in the Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit from abiraterone. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific antigen (substance in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 12 weeks of therapy. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
