The Effect of a Multi-modal Program on Fear of Cancer Recurrence in Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if MMP intervention can alleviate FCR , breast cancer symptoms and social support among breast cancer patients. he main questions it aims to answer are:

* Null Hypotheses (H0): There is no significant difference in FCR, breast cancer symptoms, and social support between the MMP intervention group and the control group.
* Alternative Hypotheses (H1): There are significant differences in FCR, breast cancer symptoms, and social support between the MMP intervention group and the control group

Researchers will compare MMP to a routine care to see if MMP works to alleviate FCR, breast cancer symptoms and social support.

Participants will:

* Receive interventions once per chemotherapy cycle for 8 weeks.
* The FCRI-SF, MSAS-SF-SC, and SSRS scales will be utilized to assess FCR levels, breast cancer symptoms and social support in both the experimental and control groups, with measurements conducted at baseline (T1), 8 weeks post-intervention (T2), and 12 weeks post-intervention (T3).

Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form, It consists of nine items, each of which is assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. The total score ranges from 0-36, with elevated scores reflecting heightened FCR, baseline; 8 weeks post-intervention; 12 weeks post-intervention|The Social Support Rating Scale, This instrument comprises 10 items categorized into three dimensions, yielding a total score between 0 and 66, where elevated scores denote greater social support., baseline; 8 weeks post-intervention; 12 weeks post-intervention|The Chinese version of memorial symptom assessment scal, The scoring range for physical symptoms is from 0-4, whereas other items are scored from 1-4. Higher scores indicate greater distress., baseline; 8 weeks post-intervention; 12 weeks post-intervention
