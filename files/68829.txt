To Compare The Effects Of Two Doses Of Vandetanib In Patients With Advanced Medullary Thyroid Cancer
The purpose of this study is to give patients with medullary thyroid cancer either 300mg/day or 150mg/day vandetanib and compare how well each dose affects how their cancer responds. It will also help the investigators understand the side effects of different doses in these patients.
Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: 300mg vandetanib|DRUG: 150mg vandetanib
Overall Response Rate (ORR) for Vandetanib 150 and 300mg With Responses Determined by the Investigator, ORR=proportion of patients with a best response of complete or partial response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST)1.1, Randomisation to week 60 (maximum)
Best Objective Response, Randomisation to week 60 (maximum)|Duration of Objective Response (RECIST 1.1) by Treatment Arm, Randomization to Week 60 (maximum)|Time to Objective Response (RECIST 1.1) by Treatment Arm, Randomization to Week 60 (maximum)|Percentage Change From Baseline in Target Lesion Size (RECIST 1.1) by Treatment Arm, Randomization to Week 60 (maximum)|Plasma Concentration of Vandetanib in the Bloodstream (Cmax) for Patients by Treatment Arm., Week 3 to week 60 (maximum)
An International, Randomised, Double-Blind, Two-Arm Study To Evaluate The Safety And Efficacy Of Vandetanib 150 And 300mg/Day In Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma With Progressive Or Symptomatic Disease
