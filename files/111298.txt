Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) and Pembrolizumab With or Without Platinum Chemotherapy in 1L Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (TROPION-Lung07)
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in participants with no prior therapy for advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Progression-free Survival Based on Blinded Independent Central Review in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Overall Survival in Participants in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 57 months
Objective Response Rate by Blinded Independent Central Review in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Progression-free Survival by Investigator in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed by the Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Objective Response Rate by Investigator in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), assessed by the Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Duration of Response by BICR and Investigator in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the date of the first radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed by BICR and by the Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1., From date of first objective response (CR or PR) to date of first radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Time to Response by BICR and Investigator in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) in responding participants, assessed by BICR and by the Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1., From randomization to date of first objective response (CR or PR), up to approximately 29 months|Disease Control Rate by BICR and Investigator in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD), assessed by BICR and by the Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 29 months|Progression-free Survival 2 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Progression-free Survival 2 (PFS2) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed by local standard clinical practice, From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 57 months|Time to Deterioration in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Time to Deterioration (TTD) is defined as the time from randomization to first onset of a ≥10-point increase in cough, chest pain, or dyspnea, confirmed by a second adjacent ≥10-point increase from randomization in the same symptom, or confirmed by death within 21 days of a ≥10-point increase from randomization, assessed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung cancer module (EORTC-QLQ-LC13)., From randomization until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 57 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), A TEAE is defined as an AE with a start or worsening date on or after the start date of study treatment until 37 days after the end date of study treatment., Up to 57 months|Proportion of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive (Baseline and Post-Baseline) and Proportion of Participants Who Have Treatment-emergent ADA, The immunogenicity of Dato-DXd in combination with pembrolizumab will be assessed., Baseline and up to 57 months
The primary objectives of the study are Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) as first line therapy in participants with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) TPS \<50% and advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable genomic alternations.

Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to a) Dato-DXd plus pembrolizumab plus platinum; b) Dato-DXd plus pembrolizumab; or c) pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed plus platinum. Platinum therapy will be either carboplatin or cisplatin at investigator discretion. The study will be divided into three periods: Screening Period (including tissue screening), Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period.
