Cushing's Syndrome I|Cushing Disease Due to Increased ACTH Secretion|Cortisol Excess|Cortisol; Hypersecretion|Cortisol Overproduction|Ectopic ACTH Secretion
DRUG: SPI-62|DRUG: Placebo
Change from baseline in urinary HSD-1 ratio, The urinary HSD-1 ratio (tetrahydrocortisol + allotetrahydrocortisol ) / tetrahydrocortisone will be used as a biomarker of HSD-1 activity in liver. The primary analysis will include only subjects with Cushing's disease., Baseline to 6 weeks
Treatment emergent adverse events, Adverse events including clinically significant abnormal values on clinical laboratory evaluations, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), 12-lead ECGs, vital signs measurements (including orthostatic vital sign measurements), physical examinations, and HPA and HPG axis biomarkers, Baseline through 24 weeks of treatment
This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study to evaluate the pharmacologic effect, efficacy, and safety of SPI-62 in subjects with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Each subject who provides consent and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria will participate in a screening period (Days -35 to -8), a baseline period (Days -7 to -1), and a treatment period (Day 1 of Week 1 to Day 168 Â± 3 days of Week 24) and, the option of long-term extension.
