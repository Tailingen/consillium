Alvocidib in Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Prolymphocytic Leukemia Arising From Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Multicenter, open-label, study of alvocidib in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.

Primary objective is to determine overall response rate.

The secondary objectives are:

* to assess overall safety,
* to assess duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival.

Clinical benefit and pharmacokinetics parameters are also evaluated.
Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic
DRUG: alvocidib
Best overall objective response rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (including nodular partial response) relative to the total number of participants.

Response assessment is based on evaluation of nodal disease by Computerized Tomography (CT) and National Cancer Institute Working Group 96 criteria (NCI-96) for assessment of liver, spleen, constitutional symptoms, peripheral blood (Â±) bone marrow., Up to a maximum of 6 cycles
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first administration of study drug to the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective progression., Up to a maximum of 6 cycles|Duration of objective response, Duration of objective response is defined from the time of first occurrence of complete response or partial response (including nodular partial response) to the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective progression., Up to a maximum of 6 cycles|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first administration of study drug to death., Up to a maximum of 6 cycles|Overview of adverse events, from study drug administration up to 30 days after last study drug administration
Treatment until disease progression or no evidence of treatment response; occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent medical problem, or adverse event (AE); or a maximum of 6 cycles.

Follow-up of 6 months after the last treatment with alvocidib.

The maximum duration of the study participation for patient will be about 15 months.
