Study of Branched-chain Amino Acids in Cancer Cachexia
Investigate whether supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) has a positive effect on cancer cachexia, as measured by the maintenance or increase in weight and lean body mass (LBM) based on body weight in kilograms (kg) and bioelectrical impedance assessment (BIA).
