A Trial on Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Versus Conventional Ultrasound Guided Biopsy of Liver Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in percutaneous biopsy for liver occupied lesion.
Liver Neoplasms
OTHER: CEUS guided biopsy|OTHER: US guided biopsy|DEVICE: Ultrasound
diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic accuracy=（true positive+ ture negative)/number of parcitipants, 12 months
The patients with liver neoplasms who need receive percutaneous biopsy were randomized into contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEUS) group and conventional ultrasound(US) group.The aims include:

1. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate, specificity and sensitivity between CEUS and US group.
2. Comparison the diagnostic accuracy rate specificity and sensitivity between smaller(\<3cm) and larger(≥3cm) nodule group.
3. To explore operating strategy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy.
4. To evaluate economic efficiency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound guided biopsy compared with conventional ultrasound guided biopsy.
