Objective Response Rate (ORR), According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) efficacy criteria. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with PR or better response after infusion of LCAR-M61SQ cells., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Very Good Partial Response Rate（VGPR）, Proportion of subjects achieving VGPR according to IMWG criteria., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Complete response（CR）, Proportion of subjects achieving CR according to IMWG criteria., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Stringent complete response（sCR）, Proportion of subjects achieving sCR according to IMWG criteria., : From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, Proportion of subjects achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate according to IMWG criteria., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression，assessed about 2 years|Time-to-response（TTR）, According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) efficacy criteria. TTR is defined as the interval from the date of the first infusion of the LCAR-M61SQ cells to the date of the first efficacy assessment for which the subject met all criteria for PR or better. Analyses were performed only in responders., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Duration of response（DOR）, According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) efficacy criteria. DOR is defined as the time from the first documented response (PR or better response) to the first documented evidence of disease progression (as defined according to IMWG criteria) or death from any cause ., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Progression-free survival（PFS）, According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) efficacy criteria. PFS is defined as the interval from the date of the first infusion of the LCAR-M61SQ cells to the first documentation of disease progression (according to IMWG criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Overall survival（OS, According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) efficacy criteria.

Overall survival (OS) is defined as the interval from the date of the first infusion of LCAR-M61SQ cells to death., From the 7th days before first dose of pretreatment with chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years|Occurrence rate of antidrug antibody, Occurrence rate of LCAR-M61SQ cells preparation ADA., From LCAR-M61SQ cells infusion until the date of first documented progression or study completion，assessed about 2 years
This study is a prospective, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor efficacy characteristics of LCAR-M61SQ in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. All subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive intravenous injection of LCAR-M61SQ cell injection. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, apheresis, pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment, and follow-up.
