Identification of Genomic Changes in Families Having Multiple Members With Tumors
This study will compare genomic alterations between the parents and the patients with high-grade glioma.
Glioma
OTHER: saliva or blood sample collection
Total genomic sequencing, Researchers will perform total genomic sequencing using next generation sequencing technology to identify common variants associated with familial brain tumors. Upon sequencing of the genomic material, the data analysis will be done using standard statistical methods. We will use bioinformatics tools (high throughput sequencing of genome) to identify genomic changes between parents and patients., within 30 days of blood or saliva collection
Genomic changes leading to the formation of brain tumors are slowly being discovered. Despite advances in genomic technology, much analysis is hindered by the lack of control samples that could better delineate genomic alterations leading to disease. The ideal genomic control would be the genetic material of the parents of afflicted individuals. The researchers propose to then compare the genomic material from parents of siblings, both of whom have a diagnosis of a high-grade glioma. Additionally, the researchers will then compare the genomic alterations between the parents and the patients. This analysis will provide an unprecedented insight into genomic level changes that take place between parents and patients that resulted in the formation of a high-grade glioma.
