Exercise Therapy in Cancer Patients Who Are Recovering From COVID-19
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 30-week aerobic exercise therapy program in cancer patients recovering from COVID-19. The study will look at whether the aerobic exercise therapy causes few or mild side effects in participants. Aerobic exercise is physical activity that uses the large muscle groups (muscles in your legs, buttocks, back, and chest) and can be performed for several minutes at a time. The aerobic exercise therapy being used in this study will be a walking program that will be adjusted so it matches participant fitness levels (how much exercise you can handle).
