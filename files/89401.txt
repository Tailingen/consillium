A Study to Establish the Feasibility of Biolen for the Local Delivery of Bicalutamide in Patients With Prostate Cancer
Biolen, a novel implant, is intended to deliver an anti-androgen locally to the prostate gland for the management of prostate disease, while minimizing systemic exposure and its associated side-effects. The objectives of the study are to assess whether the Biolen is safe.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Bicalutamide implant
Safety as measured by number and incidence of adverse events, Adverse Events, change from baseline to radical prostatectomy up to 12 weeks after implantation
change in prostate size, prostate measurement by MRI, change from baseline to radical prostatectomy up to 12 weeks after implantation|change in tumor size, tumor measurement by MRI, change from baseline to radical prostatectomy up to 12 weeks after implantation|change in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), PSA level, change from baseline to radical prostatectomy up to 12 weeks after implantation
This prospective, multi-center, single-arm feasibility study is planned to assess the safety and patient tolerance of Biolen for the localized delivery of bicalutamide into the prostate in patients presenting for treatment of prostate cancer. Study participants will have placement of the drug eluting Biolen and be followed through scheduled radical prostatectomy.
