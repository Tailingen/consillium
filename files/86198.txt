Rasburicase Versus Allopurinol in Tumor Patients at Risk for Hyperuricemia and Tumor Lysis Syndrome
This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel group study with three arms:

* Rasburicase alone
* Rasburicase followed by Allopurinol
* Allopurinol alone

The primary objective is to compare the adequacy of control of plasma uric acid concentration and the safety profile among the three arms.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome|Cancer|Hyperuricemia
DRUG: Rasburicase (SR29142)|DRUG: Allopurinol
Plasma Uric Acid Responder, Number of patients responding to treatment defined as plasma uric acid levels at Day 3 through Day 7 \<7.5 mg/dl., Day 3 through Day 7
Plasma Uric Acid, Area under the curve concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC) of plasma uric acid values, Day 1 to Day 7|Time to Uric Acid Control, Time from the first dose of study drug to the time at which plasma uric acid concentrations were determined \<=7.5 mg/dl, measured -4, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after infusion., Day 1 to Day 7
After signing the informed consent and having met the inclusion criteria, patients will be randomized to 1 of the 3 arms and treated for a total duration of 5 days. Patients in all arms will receive chemotherapy beginning 4-24 hours after the first dose of rasburicase or allopurinol.
