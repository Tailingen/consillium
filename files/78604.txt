Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, mitomycin C, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy given together with chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage I bladder cancer.

DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Mitomycin|RADIATION: Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy
Percentage of Participants Free From Radical Cystectomy at 3 Years, The number of participants who did not undergo a radical cystectomy within three years divided by the number of analyzed participants, presented with the 97.5% lower bound., Three years from registration
Percentage of Participants Free From Radical Cystectomy at 5 Years, The number of participants who did not undergo a radical cystectomy within five years divided by the number of analyzed participants., Five years from registration|Percent of Participants With Distant Disease Progression at 3 Years, Distant disease progression is defined as the first appearance of disease in a non-regional lymph node, solid organ or bone. Time to distant disease progression is defined as time from registration to the date of first distant disease progression, last known follow-up (censored), or death without distant disease progression (competing risk). Distant disease progression rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to three years|Percent of Participants With Distant Disease Progression at 5 Years, Distant disease progression is defined as the first appearance of disease in a non-regional lymph node, solid organ or bone. Time to distant disease progression is defined as time from registration to the date of first distant disease progression, last known follow-up (censored), or death without distant disease progression (competing risk). Distant disease progression rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to five years|Percentage of Participants With Progression to Tumor Stage T2 or Greater at 3 Years, Primary tumor stage T2 = tumor invades muscle; T3 = tumor invades perivesical tissue; T4 = tumor invades any of the following: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abdominal wall. Time to progression is defined as time from registration to the date of first progression, last known follow-up (censored), or death without tumor progression (competing risk). Tumor progression rates was to be estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to three years|Percentage of Participants With Progression to Tumor Stage T2 or Greater at 5 Years, Primary tumor stage T2 = tumor invades muscle; T3 = tumor invades perivesical tissue; T4 = tumor invades any of the following: prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abdominal wall. Time to progression is defined as time from registration to the date of first progression, last known follow-up (censored), or death without tumor progression (competing risk). Tumor progression rate was to be estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to five years|Percentage of Participants Who Have Died From Bladder Cancer at 5 Years (Disease-specific Survival), Time to death from bladder cancer is defined as time from registration to death from bladder cancer, last known follow-up (censored), or death from other cause (competing risk). More specifically, death absent a distant metastasis, death from non-bladder cancer, and death absent local recurrence comprise the competing risk. Death from bladder cancer rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to five years|Percentage of Participants Alive at 3 Years, Overall survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From registration to three years|Percentage of Participants Alive at 5 Years, Overall survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From registration to five years|Distribution of Participants by Highest Grade Adverse Event, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 grades adverse event severity from 1=mild to 5=death. Summary data is provided in this outcome measure; see Adverse Events Module for specific adverse event data., Adverse events are evaluated 8-10 weeks after end of study treatment (approximately 7 weeks), then every 3 months for one year, every 4 months for one year, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually. Maximum follow-up at time of reporting was 8.6 years.|Percentage of Participants With Local Recurrence at 3 Years, Time to local recurrence is defined as time from registration to the date of first local recurrence, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local recurrence (competing risk). Local recurrence rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From registration to three years|American Urological Association Total Symptom Score at Baseline and at 3 Years, The American Urological Association Total symptom score measures the severity of enlarged prostate symptoms. Possible scores range from 0 to 35, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms., Baseline and 3 years
After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter until termination of the study.
