Laparoscopic Complete Mesocolic Excision on Colon Cancer
Laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision is a concept that using laparoscopic surgery technique to perform a resection for colon cancer. Besides, the segment of the colon containing the tumor, the resection area should include an intact mesocolon as an envelope to encase the possible route for metastasis. The routes include blood vessels, lymphatic drain and etc. Such hypothesis predicts better histopathological and higher oncological results which turns into better survival rate and better quality of life.
