Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Data of survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are still limited and inconsistent. We will investigate if ACT has survival benefit over CCRT alone.
Uterine Cervical Cancer
RADIATION: Pelvic radiation|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free survival, 3-year progression free survival, 3 years
Overall survival, 3-year overall survival, 3 years
Response rate, Response rate will be assessed at 4 months after completion of CCRT (expected to be at 4 months after CCRT in the control arm or at 1 month after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in the study arm), 4 months after completion of CCRT|Cost-utility analysis, Cost and quality of life, Cost of treatment and quality of life will be assessed at baseline, completion of CCRT, q month for 3 months after CCRT, after each cycle of ACT, 2 years after completion of treatment, and when there are tumor persistence, progression or recurrence|Adverse event, Adverse events occurred during and after treatment, up to 6 months after treatment
Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is the standard treatment for cervical cancer of FIGO stage IIB-IVA or so called locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). However, failure rate after treatment is still as high as 30% to 40%.

This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial which evaluates whether adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT will improve treatment outcome comparing to CCRT alone.
