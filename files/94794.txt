Intravesical Adoptive Cell Therapy w/ TIL for BCG Exposed High Grade NMIBC
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of intravesical adoptive cell therapy using TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) in participants with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).
Urothelial Carcinoma|Non-Invasive Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Adoptive Cell Therapy with Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL)
Safety of Adoptive Cell Therapy with TILs, Toxicity will be measured according to CTCAE v5. Investigators will determine if the serious toxicity rate exceeds 17%., Up to 6 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall response is defined as the patient being alive 4 weeks after the adoptive TIL transfer, and the tumor size evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 criteria is consistent with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The overall response (CR+PR) rate will be summarized using both a point estimate and its exact 95% confidence interval based on the binomial distribution., at 3 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized with the Kaplan-Meier curve. Confidence intervals for the median and survival rates at different time points will be constructed if needed and appropriate. This secondary endpoint will be reported descriptively, up to 12 months
