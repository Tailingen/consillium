Sorafenib and High-Dose Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and External-Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving sorafenib together with high-dose chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib when given together with high-dose carboplatin, paclitaxel, and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: sorafenib tosylate|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Median survival, To determine the median survival from randomization for patients receiving carboplatin / paclitaxel with high dose radiation therapy or same regimen with Sorafenib., Mean 24-Months
Progression-free survival, To determine the overall response rate, failure-free survival and survival for patients receiving carboplatin / paclitaxel with high dose radiation therapy or same regimen with Sorafenib., Mean 24-Months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the median survival from randomization for patients receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel with high-dose radiation therapy (HDRT) or same regimen with sorafenib tosylate.

Secondary

* To determine the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival for patients receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel with 74 Gy HDRT or same regimen with sorafenib tosylate.
* To determine the feasibility of concurrent sorafenib tosylate and chemoradiation as measured by safety (the rate of grade 3 or higher radiation related esophagitis or pulmonary toxicity or chemotherapy related grade 4 hematological or other non-hematological toxicities occurring within 60 days of the start of treatment) and compliance (the completion of the treatment regimen with no more than minor variations).
* To correlate outcomes (survival, toxicity, quality of life) with biological parameters.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Phase I:

  * Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats weekly for 7 weeks. Patients undergo concurrent high-dose external beam radiotherapy (HDRT) 5 days a week for 7.5 weeks. Cohorts of patients also receive escalating doses of oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 7 weeks.
  * Consolidation therapy: Beginning at week 11, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 weeks. Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) twice daily.
  * Maintenance: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily at the MTD.
* Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

  * Arm I:

    * Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and HDRT as in phase I.
    * Consolidation therapy: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in phase I.
  * Arm II:

    * Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and HDRT as in phase I. Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate as in phase I at the MTD.
    * Consolidation therapy: Patients receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and sorafenib tosylate at the MTD as in phase I.
    * Maintenance: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate at the MTD as in phase I. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.
