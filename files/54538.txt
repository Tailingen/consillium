In all, 30 consecutive patients will be enrolled. The first 5 will be regarded as a pilot series for testing and aligning the study setup. The next 25 patients will form the study group. The clinical outcomes will be compared with historical control patients from our own department. Safety and feasibility will be assessed by short-term clinical outcomes.
