Colorectal Cancer Prehabilitation in Changi General Hospital
Cancer prehabilitation typically involves multiple pre-op visits. The investigators aim to assess the impact of their novel model, a "one-stop "service by a small, "levelled-up" core team on newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients planned for surgery.

Objective Cancer prehabilitation typically involves multiple pre-op visits. The investigators aim to assess the impact of their novel model, a "one-stop "service by a small, "levelled-up" core team on newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients planned for surgery.

Design This is a before-after trial in a tertiary public hospital in Singapore, involving all newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients planned for surgery who are referred to the Cancer Prehabilitation Program. The primary outcome measure is the 6-minute-walk-test. Others include physical, psychological, quality-of-life and post-operative measures, and patient-satisfaction-surveys, taken at baseline, pre-operatively (post-prehabilitation), and 3-months-post-operatively.
