Study of AVZO-021 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study, the first clinical trial of AVZO-021, aims to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, maximum tolerated dose, and anti-tumor effects of AVZO-021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. AVZO-021 is an oral medication that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK 2).

AVZO-021 is a compound being developed for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, specifically, HR+/HER2- breast cancer and cyclin E1 (CCNE1) altered malignancies. AVZO-021 is a selective and potent cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor, which plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. This is a Phase 1/2 first-in-human, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study of AVZO-021. Phase 1 is a dose-escalation phase aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of AVZO-021 and determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as monotherapy and combination therapy. Phase 2 is a dose-expansion phase that will be conducted to assess the antitumor activity of AVZO-021 as monotherapy and combination therapy.
