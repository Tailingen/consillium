Application of Circulating Tumor DNA Test in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With Advanced Rectal Cancer
Application of circulating tumor DNA detection in diagnosis and treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. First, to explore the feasibility of ctDNA as a detection index for rectal cancer. Second, evaluate the accuracy of ctDNA detection in rectal cancer. Third, to explore whether ctDNA can be used in the evaluation of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, so as to provide guidance for subsequent treatment. Fourth, to explore the guidance value for the decision of postoperative adjuvant therapy and the frequency of reexamination. Fifth, search for possible recurrence related mutations.
