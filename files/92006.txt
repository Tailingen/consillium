A Study of DB-1202 Monotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase 1/2a trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DB-1201 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: DB-1202
Phase 1: Percentage of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Percentage of participants in Part 1 with DLTs, up to 21 days after Cycle 1 Day 1|Phase 1: Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Percentage of participants with AEs in Part 1 graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to follow-up period, approximately 1 year post-treatment|Phase 1: Percentage of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Percentage of Participants with SAEs in Part 1 graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to follow-up period, approximately 1 year post-treatment|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of DB-1202, MTD on the data collected during Part 1, 12 months|Phase 1: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of DB-1202, RP2D of DB-1202 based on the data collected during Part 1, 12 months|Phase 2a: Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Percentage of participants with AEs in Part 2 graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to follow-up period, approximately 1 year post-treatment|Phase 2a: Percentage participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Percentage of participants with SAEs in Part 2 graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to follow-up period, approximately 1 year post-treatment|Percentage of Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1., The percentage of subjects who had a best response rating of CR and PR, for Part 2 only which was maintained â‰¥4 weeks, Up to follow-up period, approximately 1 year post-treatment
Phase 1 & Phase 2a: Pharmacokinetic-AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity of DB-1202, within 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 & Phase 2a: Pharmacokinetic-Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of DB-1202, within 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 & Phase 2a: Pharmacokinetic-Tmax, Time to Cmax of DB-1202, within 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 & Phase 2a: Pharmacokinetic-T1/2, Terminal elimination half-life, within 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, FIH study. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 adopts a rule based "3 + 3" design to identify MTD/RP2D; Part 2 is a dose expansion phase to confirm the safety, tolerability and efficacy in selected solid malignant tumors.
