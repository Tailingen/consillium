This Study Aims to Find and Test a Safe Dose of BI 905677 in Patients With Different Types of Cancer (Solid Tumours)
This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumours). This study is open to people in whom previous treatments were not successful. The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 905677 the participants can tolerate. BI 905677 is a type of an antibody that is being developed to treat cancer.

One dose of BI 905677 is given to the participants every 2 or 3 weeks as infusion into a vein. In this study, BI 905677 is given to humans for the first time. The participants visit the study site at least once a week so that the doctors can check their general health. The participants are in the study for as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment.

DRUG: BI 905677
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) is reported. Any of the following adverse events (AEs) will be classified as DLTs following review by the Safety Monitoring Committee and the Medical Monitor, unless unequivocally due to underlying malignancy or an extraneous cause, including any AE which prevents a patient starting Cycle 2 within 14 days of completion of Cycle 1; Bone mineral density change of \>5% from baseline, confirmed at least 2 months after initial observation; Î²-CTX increase of more than two-fold from baseline; Grade 3 osteoporosis, and so on., In the first treatment cycle, up to 3 weeks|Number of Patients Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) During the Entire Treatment Period, The Number of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) during the entire treatment period is reported., From first dose until last dose + 42 days (6 weeks) of residual effect period, up to 36 weeks.
Maximum Measured Concentration of BI 905677 in Serum After First Infusion (Cmax), The Maximum measured concentration of BI 905677 in serum after first infusion is reported., 5 minutes (min) before and at 1, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 72, 168 and 336 hour(s) after first dosing in Cycle 1.|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve Over the Time Interval From 0 to the Last Measured Time Point (AUC0-tz), The Area under the serum concentration-time curve over the time interval from 0 to the last measured time point is reported., 5 minutes (min) before and at 1 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 72, 168 and 336 hour(s) after first dosing in Cycle 1.
