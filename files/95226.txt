Skin Fluorescent Imaging (SFI) System in Patients With Nevi
The Sponsor has developed the Skin Fluorescent Imaging (SFI) system, an in vivo imaging modality, for the purpose of providing physicians with insight into the biological changes occurring during tissue remodeling in a nevus.
Nevus|Dysplasia; Epithelial
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Skin Fluorescent Imaging
Establish the performance of SFI, Establish the performance (sensitivity and specificity) for SFI in comparison to dysplasia., 1year
To compare SFI to clinical diagnosis., Comparison of the SFI score ( 0 to 10) to the clinical diagnosis of the physician assessing and the pathologist, 1 year|To establish the tolerability of SFI Testing by documenting minimal, transient events that occur with reagent application., Adverse events will be collected to ensure overall safety of reagents and imaging, 1 year
The SFI system, a non-invasive point-of-care imaging system, is able to detect markers associated with tissue remodeling and thus provide real-time information about biological and structural changes occurring in nevi indicative of dysplastic transition.
