Study of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Chinese Participants With Locally Advanced Inoperable or Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer
This is an open-label Phase I study of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine administered by intravenous (IV) infusion. The study will characterize the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine and its relevant analytes and the safety of trastuzumab emtansine in Chinese participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC).
