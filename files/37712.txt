Global DNA hypomethylation is a hallmark of most cancers that occurs early during oncogenesis. We would like to investigate whether cancer-specific transcription factor binding to DNA G-quadruplex drives DNA hypomethylation in cancer. In this observational study, we would like to clarify whether DNA hypomethylation around G-quadruplex loci in cell-free DNA could be detected in early-stage cancer patients from healthy donors with high sensitivity and specificity.
