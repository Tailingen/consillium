Study of Azacytidine Combined With Lenalidomide As Maintenance Therapy Based on MRD Monitoring in AML
Great progress has been witnessed on the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in recent years. However, elderly patients ineligible for receiving high dose chemotherapy and allo-HSCT, have high relapse rate and treatment-related complications. Azacitidine (AZA), a listed hypomethylating agent in China in 2018, is the only approved demethylating drug in the treatment of AML, following the NCCN guidelines. In addition, lenalidomide(LEN) has been shown to rapidly enhance cytotoxic T- and natural killer (NK)-cell function and reduce relapse post-chemotherapy in patients with MM, also has substantial activity as a single agent in elderly patients with AML. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has been proven to be highly prognostic in quite a number clinical studies. This study is aimed to validate the efficacy and safety advantages of the maintenance therapy that contain AZA and LEN in elderly or unfit for intensive therapy patients with AML based on MRD monitoring.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Lenalidomide
DFS, DFS in months, in present of disease free survival period of all participants, From date of randomization or complete remission until the date of first documented disease progression from any cause,assessed up to 100weeks|OS, OS in months, in present of over all survival period of all participants, From date of randomization until the date of first documented death from any cause or end of this study, whichever come first,assessed up to 100weeks
Adverse events rates, Adverse events rates in percentage, From date of randomization or initial treatment until the end date of the study, assessed up to 100 weeks
In this study, elderly or unfit for intensive therapy AML patients who had achieved complete remission(CR) after remission-induction and consolidation chemotherapy were assigned to 3 Arms: (1) Maintenance therapy with AZA combined with LEN（AZA+LEN）: AZA 50mg/m² per day for days 1-5 and LEN 10mg per day orally for days 6-26 , every 28 days for up to 12 cycles or progression; (2) Maintenance therapy with AZA only: AZA 50mg/m² per day for days 1-5, every 28 days for up to 12 cycles or progression; (3) Observation or with supporting therapy. MRD will be assessed by flow cytometry and molecular techniques. The efficacy and safety of the 3 Arms will be evaluated in this study.
