HLA-Mismatched Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation With Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide
This is a prospective, multi-center, Phase II study of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD) for peripheral blood stem cell transplant in adults and bone marrow stem cell transplant in children. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be used for for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. This trial will study how well this treatment works in patients with hematologic malignancies.
