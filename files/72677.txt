A Study of CS5001 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
This is a first-in-human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of experimental drug CS5001 in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Advanced Lymphoma
DRUG: CS5001
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of CS5001 if any (for dose escalation part), Participants will receive CS5001 for injection once every three weeks. The MTD will be determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., About 6 months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose(RP2D) of CS5001 (for dose escalation part), The selection of RP2D will be based on consideration of overall safety information together with available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data. The RP2D may be the MTD or may be a lower dose within the tolerable dose range., About 6 months|Incident and severity of adverse events, Until 90 days since the last dose of investigational product or until initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first
Concentration of CS5001 total antibody, prodrug and the free cytotoxin, Up to 30 days since the last dose of or until initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first|Concentration of anti-CS5001 antibodies, Up to 30 days since the last dose of or until initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first
Anti-tumor activity of CS5001 at RP2D in patient with selected advanced cancers (For dose expansion part), About up to 12 months
This is a first-in-human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of experimental drug CS5001 in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumors.
