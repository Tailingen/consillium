177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 in Patients With Integrin αVβ3 Positive Tumors
This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to assess the safety and measure image-based absorbed dose of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 in patients with Integrin αVβ3 positive tumors who will undergo radioliagnd therapy using 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2.
Integrin αVβ3 Positive Tumors
DRUG: 1.48 GBq of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2
StandarStandardized uptake value of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 in normal organs and tumors., The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value at each time point in normal organs and tumors will be measured., 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 2 months after the injection and scanning of patients will be followed and assessed., 2 months
Integrin αvβ3 is highly expressed in some tumor cells and neovascularization, which is an ideal target for diagnosis and treatment of Integrin αVβ3 positive tumors. 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2, is a kind of new drug based on independent research and development in China, provide an effective target for the treatment of Integrin αVβ3 positive tumors. All patients underwent whole-body 68Ga-RGD PET/CT for selection and accepted intravenous injection with single dose 1.48 GBq (40 mCi) of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 within one week. 1-2 ml venous blood was collected at 5min, 3h, 24h, 72h and 168h after administration to detect radioactivity count, respectively. Then monitored at 3, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 administration with serial whole body planar and SPECT/CT imaging (72 or 96h). Analyze and calculate the internal radiation dose of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 and evaluate its therapeutic efficiency and response.
