Improving Function,Welfare of Late-stage Cancer Subjects by ACC
To improve the function and welfare of late stage solid cancer subjects by:

* enabling subjects to benefit from a potentially promising drug under development
* assessing initial evidence of improvement in Pain VAS score
* assessing initial improvement in Performance Status (PS)
* assessing initial improvement in oxygen saturation whenever it is feasible
Solid Malignancies, With or Without Lung Metastases
DRUG: Amorphous Calcium Carbonate
Assessing a change in Pain Visual Analog Score (VAS score), Visual Analog scale ranging from 0 up to 10 meaning that ; 0 = no pain(min) 10=unbearable pain(max), Baseline and on weeks 0,1,2,3,4,5,8 and on week 11
Assessing a change in Performance Status (PS): ECOG scale, assessing the patients improvement or not in their performance status;0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction.1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work.2 Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours.3 Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours 4 Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair.5 Dead, Baseline and on weeks 0,1,2,3,4,5,8 and on week 11
To improve the function and welfare of late stage solid cancer subjects by:

* enabling subjects to benefit from a potentially promising drug under development
* assessing initial evidence of improvement in Pain VAS score
* assessing initial improvement in Performance Status (PS)
* assessing improvement in oxygen saturation whenever it is feasible/ dyspnea measurement (Modified Borg Scale)
