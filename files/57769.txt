Intraperitoneal Infusion of ex Vivo-cultured Allogeneic NK Cells in Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma Patients
This study investigates an innovative treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer exploiting ex vivo-generated allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells with or without preceding non-myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy.

This study investigates an innovative treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer exploiting ex vivo-generated allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells with or without preceding non-myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy.

This study is a phase I safety and feasibility study in a series of 12 patients who are suffering from recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Prior to NK cell infusion, a laparoscopy is performed to place a catheter in the peritoneal cavity. The first cohort of three patients will receive an intraperitoneal infusion of allogeneic UCB-NK cells generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from an allogeneic UCB unit without a preparative regimen. In the second group of three patients the same UCB-NK cell dosage will be given with a preparative regimen of four days non-myeloablative immunosuppressive conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (CyFlu). If no severe toxicity is seen in these 6 patients, an extension cohort of 6 patients will be included to answer the secondary objective.
