Maintenance Azacitidine in Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in CR After Induction Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to find out if patients older than 60, with acute myeloid leukemia, who are in complete remission following initial chemotherapy, will live longer and have a lower rate of leukemia relapse when treated with azacitidine.
Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine
Rate of Disease Free Survival at One Year, The primary efficacy variable is disease free survival measured at one year, which is the percentage of patients who remain alive and disease free one year after the confirmation of remission by bone marrow biopsy. Relapse is defined by a bone marrow specimen with \>5% blasts or the presence of Auer rods., 1 year
Overall Survival (OS), The secondary efficacy variable is overall survival measured as time to death, which is the time from remission until death from any cause., 48 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of treatment as measured by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, 48 months
Patient activity will encompass approximately 48 months: an approximate 24 month enrollment period, followed by 6 to 12 months of patient treatment. Patients will be followed for 1 year following completion of study drug treatment. During follow-up, bone marrow biopsies to confirm disease status should be obtained if peripheral blood blasts are present or if there is development of unexpected blood abnormalities to warrant suspicion of relapse, or at a minimum of every 6 months.
