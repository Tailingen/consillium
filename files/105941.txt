A Phase 1 Study of LY2787106 in Cancer and Anemia
This study will evaluate the safety LY2787106 in participants with cancer and anemia. It will also evaluate when LY2787106 can improve anemia. This study has two parts: Part A is a dose escalation evaluation. Part B is an evaluation of LY2787106 at a defined dose given with and without iron supplementation.
Anemia
DRUG: LY2787106|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Iron Supplementation
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Events, Number of participants with one or more treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) or any Serious AE (SAE). A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Baseline to Study Completion (up to 5 Years)|Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin With or Without Oral Iron Supplementation, This analysis assesses the mean change in Hemoglobin from baseline to the end of Cycle 4. The analysis was carried separately for Cohort B1 without supplemental iron and Cohort B2 with supplemental iron., Baseline, Cycle 4 (7-day cycle)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax is the maximum serum concentration after a single IV dose of the study drug., Days 1, 2, and 4 of Cycles 1 and 5, Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 (Part A 21-day cycles, Part B 7-day cycles) and 1, 3, and 9 weeks after the last infusion|PK: Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-∞]), AUC is the area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity., Days 1, 2, and 4 of Cycles 1 and 5, Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 (Part A 21-day cycles, Part B 7-day cycles) and 1, 3, and 9 weeks after the last infusion|Recommended Dose for Future Studies: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as being the highest tested dose below the level at which one-third or more of participants experience a Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT is defined as an adverse event occurring in any part of the study that is related to the study medication, occurs during Cycle 1 of Part A, and fulfills any one of the following criteria:

1. Clinically significant Grade 2 toxicity, such as angina, arrhythmia, seizure, dyspnea, rash with significant blistering or desquamation, or other event deemed significant by either the investigator.
2. ≥Grade 3 anemia (excluding participants with baseline \<9.0 g/dL) or hemoglobin (Hb) decrease \>1.0 g/dL if baseline Hb \<9.0 g/dL, confirmed by 2 independent measurements.
3. ≥ Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction.
4. Other ≥ Grade 3 hematological or non-hematological toxicity., Baseline to Cycle 1 of Part A|Change From Baseline in Serum Iron, Mean change in serum iron from baseline to the end of Cycle 4., Baseline, Cycle 4 (7-day cycle)|Mean Change From Baseline in Reticulocyte Count, Mean change in reticulocyte count from baseline to the end of Cycle 4., Baseline, Cycle 4 (7-day cycle)
