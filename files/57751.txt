Management of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ or Pure Micro-invasive Extended Breast
The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) and a mastectomy indication will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS in-patient population that will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI. A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred.
Intraductal Carcinoma and Lobular Carcinoma in Situ
PROCEDURE: sentinel node biopsy and mastectomy
Highlight the contribution of sentinel node associated with a mastectomy immediately in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and micro-invasive (DCIS-MI), Highlight the interest of GAS associated with a mastectomy immediately in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and micro-infiltrating (DCIS-MI) with indication of mastectomy in estimating the rate of axillary dissection avoided due a GAS-detected, 2 years
Among women with ductal carcinoma in situ pure (DCIS) and micro-infiltrating (DCIS-MI) and indication of mastectomy, * Number and rate of axillary dissection performed immediately during the mastectomy following the discovery of a GAS +, having avoided a surgical procedure later;
* rate of discordance between biopsy and histology final;
* detection rate of sentinel axillary lymph nodes (GAS), regardless of nodal status;
* GAS positive rate in the population of patients in whom the GAS has been detected.

  200 patients: 100 patients with a biopsy showing DCIS and an indication of mastectomy and 100 patients with a biopsy showing DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy, 2 years
The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS and a mastectomy indication will be obtained by calculating the proportion of women with GAS in-patient population that will prove to be DCIS or DCIS-MI + CCI (after the final histology). A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred (binomial).

The rate of axillary dissection avoided in patients with DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy is obtained by calculating the proportion of women with a GAS-all women with DCIS-MI and an indication of mastectomy. A confidence interval of 95% will be deferred (binomial).
