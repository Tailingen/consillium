The Effects of Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Administration on Immune Suppression and Outcomes in Patients With Uterine Cancer Undergoing Radical Resection
Surgical stress and anesthesia may cause immunosuppression in immunocompromised cancer patients. The natural killer (NK) cell is a critical part of anti-tumor immunity. Dexmedetomidine has sympatholytic effect and preserves NK cell function. This study investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on immune suppression and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing uterine cancer resection.
