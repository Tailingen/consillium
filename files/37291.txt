Autologous Gamma Delta T Cells to Target Prostate Stem Cell Antigen in mCRPC
This is a phase 1 single center clinical trial for patients with end stage Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer who have progressed through standard of care treatment options and are on zoledronate for bone metastases. This clinical trial includes a dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of treatment with autologous T cells genetically modified to express Prostate stem cell antigen.
