At-home Breast Oncology Care Delivered With E-health Solutions
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted healthcare service delivery, highlighting the need for high quality virtual patient care. Our team has developed a multi-dimensional remote eHealth solution for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and their practitioners to use during the diagnostic and follow-up period. The ABODE study involved development of a Breast Cancer Treatment Application (app) which will facilitate virtual consultations, deliver patient education material, and collect patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). Using a randomized controlled trial design, the team will evaluate a variety of outcomes for breast cancer patients who will use the app throughout their diagnosis and treatment period.

Primary Objective: To compare changes in patient activation (assessed by PAM-13) over 1 year among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients between those using the app and those receiving standard care.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Compare additional PROMs between the standard care and intervention groups
2. Describe health service outcomes among app users
3. Explore end-user experience of using the app
4. Measure activity levels using wearable devices

OTHER: At-home Breast Oncology care Delivered with E-health solutions - ABODE
Primary Objective, To compare changes in patient activation (assessed by Patient Activation Measure -13) over 1 year among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients between those using the Breast Cancer Treatment Application (BCTA) and those receiving standard care.

Difference in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) scores between pre/post intervention. PAM includes 13 questions, each with 4 response options, summed on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating higher activation level.

Patient activation is defined as the knowledge, skills, and confidence a person has in managing their health and care. Studies have shown that higher patient activation is associated with improved health related quality of life (HRQoL) and lower health care utilization., At baseline, 6 months and 12 months after enrollment
PROM 1: Impact of Events Scale - Revised (IES-R), Number of participants with PTSD symptoms, such as distress in regards to their Breast Cancer diagnosis and treatment as assessed by IES-R.

Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("extremely"). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88); higher scores mean worse symptoms., At baseline, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis|PROM 2: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Number of participant with generalized anxiety around their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment assessed by GAD-7.

The EORTC Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) includes six clearly distinguishable functioning scales that have been thoroughly tested and validated on an international level and that are available in 110 different language versions. About the functional scale and the global health status, the higher the total score, the better the quality of life; the lower the score in the symptom scale, the better the quality of life., At baseline, 6-months and 12-months post-diagnosis|PROM 4: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23), Number of participants with changes in their quality of life after their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment journey assessed by the EORTC QLQ-BR23.

The survey includes functional scales (body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, and future perspective) and single item symptoms scales (systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, and upset by hair loss). Questions used 4-point Likert scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Scores average and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score for functional scale=high/healthy level of functioning. High score for single item=high level of symptomatology/problems., At baseline, 6-months and 12-months after enrollment|PROM 5: Self-Identification Survey, Number of participants and their reported identities assessed by the self-identification survey., At baseline|PROM 6: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire INFO 25 (EORTC QLQ-INFO 25)., Number of participants and their satisfaction with information provided about treatment received assessed by the EORTC QLQ-INFO25.

The provisional 25-item information questionnaire is Questions used 4-point Likert scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Scores average and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score for functional scale=higher satisfaction with provided treatment information., 9-months post-diagnosis|PROM 7: The Health Information Questionnaire (heiQ), Number of participants and how comfortable they are with the patient educational programs provided throughout the patient's treatment journey, assessed by the heiQ at the beginning and 9 months post diagnosis.

Each domain score ranges from 1 to 4; a higher score indicates better outcome., At baseline, 9 months post-diagnosis|PROM 8: Clinical Evaluation Questionnaire - INS (CEQ-INS), Number of participants and their experience of cancer care in teams of their receipt of useful and relevant information about cancer, assistance with service navigation, and support from their care team examined with the CEQ-INS half way and end of the study.

CEQ-INS is a self-reported instrument with questions used 4-point Likert scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Higher scores correlate with higher patient satisfaction with the information and support provided from their care team., 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis|PROM 9: Other Health App Questionnaire (OHA), Number of participants and how frequently they use other e-health applications assessed by the OHA.

The assessment administers 4 point Likert-type questions (never=0 to often=5) regarding how individuals feel after being told their genetic test results.

Distress subscale = Items 1-4, 7 \& 8; Uncertainty subscale = Items 9-12, 14-17 \& 20; Positive experiences subscale (reverse scored) = Items 5, 6, 18 \& 19.

The survey will be administered to participants using the application at the 12-month mark, to better understand any barriers to using the app and which aspects were most useful to patients. The 10 item assessment uses 5-point Likert-type questions (strongly disagree to strongly agree) to assess their experience on the application., 12-months Post-Enrollment|PROM 14: Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) Score, Investigators will measure relative changes in adverse symptom burden using the Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) questionnaire. The FACT-ES is a 46-item questionnaire asking participants to report how much they have been impacted by a variety of symptoms on a 5-point scale where 0 = not at all and 4 = very much. Total raw scores range from 0 to 184, with higher scores indicating greater impact from symptoms., 2 to 3 Months Post Start of Endocrine Treatment via Breast Cancer Treatment App|PROM 15: System-Usability Score (SUS), Usability will be assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). We wil collect the input of breast cancer patients to the SUS questions, using in-app surveys and will calculate the SUS score.

To measure the effect of the app compared to the standard care approach, the study team will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 200 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients seen at a tertiary care cancer centre in Ontario, Canada. The intervention group (n=100) will receive access to the app in addition to standard care for 13 months following their diagnosis. The control group (n=100) will have standard care. Both arms will be provided with a Fitbit wearable device.

The PAM-13 scale assesses patient activation, defined as the knowledge and confidence a patient has in self- management of one's health. Research team will test whether use of the app improves PAM-13 scores at the 12-month follow-up.

Additionally, secondary outcomes will be assessed with data from additional patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), chart review, hospital administrative databases, and Fitbits. All participants will complete PROMs at baseline, 6- and 12- months post diagnosis via REDCap survey links sent through email. The intervention group will have access to the app for 13 months following randomization.
