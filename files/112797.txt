Coagulopathy in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
The goal of this study is to investigate the hemostatic balance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to the ALLTogether1 protocol with focus on the early treatment period including concomitant use of steroids and asparaginase.

The investigators aim to determine if complement proteins or microparticles can be used as clinically relevant predictive or diagnostic biomarkers for thrombosis and if global hemostatic assays can predict bleeding or thrombosis. Characterization of proteins connected to hemostasis before and during ALL treatment may provide pathophysiological insights regarding ALL- and treatment related coagulopathy. The ultimate goal of the study is to minimize the morbidity and mortality related to thrombosis and bleeding complications in children with ALL.

Several pediatric oncology centers in Sweden will be participating in this study, which will enroll approximately 100 pediatric patients.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Thrombosis|Bleeding|Hemostatic Disorder
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Coagulopathy parameters
Coagulation events (thrombosis and/or bleeding) in early phases of treatment for childhood ALL according to the ALLTogether1 therapy protocol, Incidence of coagulation events during the induction and consolidation phases (first 106 days of ALL-therapy), From diagnosis until the start of the subsequent phase of therapy (day 0 to 106 in protocol therapy)
Laboratory abnormalities indicating a risk of haemostatic events in the early phases of childhood ALL therapy, Incidence of laboratory abnormalities during the induction and consolidation phases (first 106 days of ALL-therapy), From diagnosis until the start of the subsequent phase of therapy (day 0 to 106 in protocol therapy)|Sub-clinical catheter-related thrombosis (central vein catheters) during the early phases of childhood ALL therapy, Thrombosis detected by ultrasound screening of catheterised neck veins, At the end of induction (protocol day 29 +/- 3 days)
