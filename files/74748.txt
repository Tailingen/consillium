Study of Safety and Efficacy of Durvalumab in Combination With Paclitaxel in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer has been previously demonstrated (Ghebeh et al 2006). In addition, PD-L1 has been shown to work as a "molecular shield", by protecting cancer cells from cytotoxic T-cells and chemotherapy induced apoptosis (Ghebeh et al 2008) suggesting to combine PD-L1 blockade with chemotherapy.

This trial will test Durvalumab in combination with Paclitaxel on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. The safety profile of Durvalumab as a monotherapy has been previously established (lu et al 2015). In this trial the safety profile and tolerability of Durvalumab given in combination of Paclitaxel will be tested. In addition, the efficacy of this combination on metastatic breast cancer will be monitored.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Durvalumab
Number of patients with adverse events (severe and non-severe), 12 months
Objective response rate (ORR), 24 months|Progression free survival, 24 months
This open label single arm trial will involve metastatic triple negative PD-L1 positive breast cancer patients. The trial will include a dose deescalation phase where three doses of paclitaxel will be tried on 3 patients each followed by a dose expansion phase on 25 patients. Paclitaxel will be given weekly for 1 cycle followed by combination of Paclitaxel and Durvalumab. Once 6 cycles of Paclitaxel are completed, Durvalumab will be given alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The toxicity and tolerability of the combination will be the main end point while the efficacy will be a secondary end point.
