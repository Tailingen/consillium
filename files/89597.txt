Falls Among the Older Patients Treated for Cancer in Normandy's Outclinics: Screening and Prevention
The French Plan National AntiChute (published on February 21, 2022) and international recommendations on falls prevention (Age Ageing,September 2022) recommend identifying the risk of falling in people aged 65 and over, at least once a year during a follow-up consultation. The presence of chronic illness such as cancer increases the risk for falling. Recommendations suggest targeted preventive interventions according to the risk level, and early reassessment at 3 months in case of high risk.

This study consists of a cross-sectional survey conducted during a week dedicated to patient safety (September 16-20, 2024), to identify the prevalence of patients at high risk for falling, requiring enhanced care. The relation between high risk for falling and social and oncological characteristics will be studied. A 3-month telephone follow-up will identify any obstacles to implementing the recommendations in this high-risk group.

This multicenter cross-sectional prospective study is exploratory.
