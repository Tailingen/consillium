Dual TORC1/TORC2 Inhibitor ATG-008 (CC-223) in HBV Positive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Subjects
This is an Asian multi-regional clinical trial (MRCT) in which ATG-008 will be administered orally to hepatitis B positive (HBV+) HCC subjects who have received at least one prior line of systemic therapy. It is designed as an open-label phase 2 trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral ATG-008 administered daily until the radiologic disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or intolerable toxicity.
