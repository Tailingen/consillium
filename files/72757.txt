Cohort Trial on Perioperative Localization Techniques of Parathyroid Adenomas
A prospective database of consecutive patients with hyperparathyroidism subject to surgery is created. Preoperative workup and operative findings are recorded in this registry to allow comprehensive analysis.

This is a non-interventional, prospective, monocentric, non-randomized trial. All patients with biochemically confirmed Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) who are scheduled for elective parathyroidectomy in the Endocrine and Digestive Surgery Unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg are considered. Data concerning the age, the operative date, the results of the pre-operative biological work-up (plasma calcium, phosphor, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, vitamin D), the results of pre-operative imaging (CT (computerized tomography) scan, 99mTc SestaMIBI Scan, 3D-Vitual Neck Exploration (VNE)), the operative data (the surgical approach, the localization and the dimensions of the adenoma (s), the necessity to convert to classical approach and its reason, the values of the intra operative PTH), the pathology results, the biological work-up at follow-up (plasma calcium, phosphor, PTH, vitamin D) are prospectively recorded in the database.
