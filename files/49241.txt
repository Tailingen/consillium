Study of SYH2039 in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study of the safety, PK, PD and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SYH2039 in adult patients with selected advanced or metastatic advanced solid tumors who are unresponsive to standard of care therapy. SYH2039 is a small molecule inhibitor of methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A).
Advanced or Metastatic MTAP-deleted Solid Tumors
DRUG: SYH2039
Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of SYH2039, Incidence of DLTs of SYH2039 will be determined, 24 days following the first dose of SYH2039|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of SYH2039, RP2D of SYH2039 will be determined, Approximately 2 years
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of SYH2039, Approximately 2 years|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of SYH2039, Approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be assessed by Investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), Approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be assessed by Investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), Approximately 2 years|S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), Change from Baseline in Circulating Concentration of SAM, Approximately 2 years
This study is being done to learn more about a new drug called BG-89894 (previously known as SYH2039). Researchers want to see if the drug is safe, how well people can tolerate it, how it moves through the body, and whether it shows any early signs of helping to treat cancer. The information gathered may help guide how future studies are designed. The entire study is expected to last about four years. People who join the study may receive treatment for around six months and will be followed for about 12 months after their treatment ends. The study plans to enroll participants over a three-year period.
