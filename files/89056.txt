Development of a Standardized Reference Guide for Tuning Adherence to Dispense During a Initial Pharmaceutical Consulting (CP ) to the Patient With Multiple Myeloma Oral Chemotherapy Primocure
The hypothesis is that the implementation of an initial Pharmaceutical Consultation (PC) program based on the provision of standardized information to patients treated for multiple myeloma as a first course of chemotherapy, could optimize their compliance with the delivered per os treatment.

The aim of this study is therefore to develop a standardised reference guide of information to be provided during prostate cancer in order to optimise the compliance of patients treated for multiple myeloma as a first course of chemotherapy per os.
