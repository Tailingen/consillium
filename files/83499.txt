Using Virtual Reality to Reduce Procedural Pain in Children With Cancer
This study will assess the impact of virtual reality (VR) in decreasing procedural pain related to subcutaneous port (SCP) access in children with cancer. The study is a pilot-randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a cross-over design that will provide us with detailed information on the feasibility of implementing our trial protocol in a future multi-center RCT as well as preliminary estimate of VR treatment effect on children with cancer undergoing SCP access, including child and parent factors potentially associated with VR distraction treatment efficacy.

Accural Rates/Retention Rates, Using a recruitment log to measure eligible children per recruitment day, reasons for ineligibility, reasons for non-participation and reasons for study attrition., 6 months|Acceptability, Measured using the VR Distraction Satisfaction Questionnaire completed by children and nurses and will collect data on acceptability, perceived utility of pain reducing procedures, and recommendations for changes related to the needle insertion experience., 6 months|Outcome measure feasibility, Will be measured as the percentage of completed outcome measures at baseline and study completion and will be recorded on the VR Distraction Activity Log, 6 months|Technical Difficulties/Practical Difficulties, Record data related to technical/practical difficulties associated with the VR intervention, RA observed difficulties in implementing the trial protocol in the clinic and time to complete SCP access., 6 months
Pain Intensity, For both pre and post study procedures, children will self report their pain and parents, nurses and the RA will report children's pain using an 11 point NRS scale (0 being no pain at all and 10 being the most pain you can imagine this child or you having), 6 months|Child Distress, For both pre and post study procedures, distress during the SCP study will be measured using the observer-rated Behavioural Approach-Avoidance Scale (BAADS). 2 research team members will code video-recordings from all SCP needle insertion using the BAADS., 6 months|Child Fear, Children will report fear both prior to and following the procedure using the CFS which is a visual scale with established psychometrics in children as young as 5., 6 months|Child Pain Catastrophizing, Children will report baseline tendencies to catastrophize about pain using the PCS-C., 6 months|Parent Pain Catastrophizing, Parents will report baseline tendencies to catastrophize about their child's pain using the PCS-P which is a self-reporting measure of pain., 6 months|Parent Distress, Parents will report on their own level of distress following the child's procedure using the Parent Distress Questionnaire., 6 months
The study is a repeated-measures cross-over pilot RCT to examine the feasibility of the trial protocol for a study into the effectiveness of immersive VR in minimizing procedural pain and distress in children with cancer. The research objectives are to: (1) pilot implementing immersive virtual reality (VR) for effectiveness testing in a future RCT (measured as implementation outcomes); (2) determine treatment effect sizes (measured as preliminary effectiveness outcomes), between VR, programmed to distract children during an SCP needle insertion, and an active control intervention (i.e., watching a video with headphones); and (3) assess impact of child and parent factors potentially associated with VR treatment effectiveness. Both the intervention and control groups will receive standard medical care (e.g., topical anesthetics). A convenience sample of 40 children and adolescents with cancer (20 participants per treatment arm; 10 boys and 10 girls per treatment arm) will be recruited. In addition, each child will act as their own control. A washout period of 1 month will be used to control for any carry-over effect between conditions. In addition to usual care, children in the experimental condition will wear the VR headset plus headphones. In the control condition, children will watch a video (i.e., an age-appropriate video selected by an oncology-affiliated child life specialist) on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones as in the experimental condition. Implementation outcomes include accrual and retention rates, acceptability and technical difficulties. Effectiveness outcomes include child pain, distress, and fear, as well as parent distress.
