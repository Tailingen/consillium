This study is a multi-center, non-interventional study. Patients' background, treatment pattern, treatment outcome, efficacy will be collected in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who were treated with chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy as 1st line treatment at approximately 5 institutions. The patients should have received at least 1 cycle of immunotherapy and chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Based on these data, overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) from start of 1st line treatment and the role and efficacy of radiotherapy for these patients will be assessed.
