A Single-arm Pilot Study of Tislelizumab Combined With Anlotinib in Patients With Advanced NSCLC With Driver-negative After Progression to Immunotherapy
Immune resistance after treatment, there is no standard treatment, one of the most important and the most effective measures is immune to combination therapy。Targeted angiogenesis therapy has always been the focus of research on the treatment of NSCLC patients with progressive disease after immunotherapy. From the mechanism of action, angiogenesis and immunosuppression are interrelated processes.
Advanced NSCLC
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Anlotinib
objective response rate, The rate of tumor shrinkage reached 30% at least .including part reponse and complete response, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
