Evaluation of 3D Ultrasound in Brain Tumor Surgery
Evaluation of impact of use of 3D ultrasound in brain tumor surgery on extend of resection. Benefit for surgery, neurological outcome, accuracy and image quality are secondary outcome parameters. Control group is a retrospective matched pair cohort.
Residual Tumor
DEVICE: resection with help of 3D ultrasound
Extent of resection, Volumetric assessment of residual T1 contrast enhancement or FLAIR signal changes in enhancing and non-enhancing glioma, respectively., 48 hours after surgery
image quality, ultrasound image quality, both for 2D and 3D as rated by surgeon and scored from 1(best) to 6 (worst)., during surgery|neurological outcome, both at discharge and at 3 months follow up using NIHSS Score, both after surgery and at 3 months|Accuracy of device, ultrasound image acuracy compared to preoperative MRI, both for 2D and 3D as rated by surgeon and scored from 1(best) to 6 (worst), including rating of brainshift and navigation inaccuracy., during surgery
brainshift during surgery, brainshift in mm during surgery comparing preoperative landmarks with intraoperative landmarks in ultrasound and intraooperative MRI, during surgery
