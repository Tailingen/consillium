IKS014 in Advanced Solid Tumors That Express HER2
This study will evaluate the recommended dose for further clinical development, safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IKS014, a HER2 targeting antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: IKS014
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (Part 1), Based on tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetics, Up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (Part 2), Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (Part 1), Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months|Plasma Concentrations of IKS014 (Part 1 and 2), Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from observed concentrations of IKS014, Up to 48 months|Evaluation of the immunogenicity of IKS014 (Part 1 and 2), Occurrence of ADA measured in serum at selected timepoints during the study, Up to 48 months
The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part 1) and dose-expansion (Part 2). The dose-escalation part (Part 1) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of IKS014 to establish a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and the dose-expansion part (Part 2) of the study is to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of IKS014 at the RP2D.
