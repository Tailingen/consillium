Mandibular Reconstruction Preplanning (ViPMR)
Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP), where 3D modeling is used to create 3D-printed surgical guides, has been shown to improve outcomes for patients who undergo mandibular reconstruction surgery, usually due to invasion of cancer from the oral cavity to the jaw. This trial will directly compare the outcomes of patients who receive VSP versus patients who receive the current standard of care, which is Free-Hand Surgery (FHS). They will be randomized into either treatment at a 1:1 ratio and bony union rates will be compared between 12-month postoperative CT scans for each treatment group. Secondary objectives include comparing other short and long-term complication rates, reconstruction accuracy, quality of life, and functional outcomes of VSP and FHS. An economic analysis of VSP will also be performed.

PROCEDURE: Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP)|PROCEDURE: Free-Hand Surgery
Bony Union, The primary outcome is nonunion as assessed by two independent radiologists at Vancouver General Hospital, blinded to the intervention, based on the 12-month postoperative CT scan. Each apposition (between native bone-flap or between flap segments) will be assessed as nonunion, partial union, and complete union. Cases where there is disagreement between reviewers will undergo consensus review, any persisting disagreements will be reviewed by a third radiologist and classification will be based on the majority vote., Assessed on CT scans 12 months postoperatively
Difference in Intracondylar Distance, Comparison to assess structural reconstruction accuracy of postoperative versus preoperative cephalometrics. This will be calculated as the absolute value of postoperative intracondylar distance minus preoperative intercondylar distance (millimeters)., Assessed between preoperative CT (at least 6 days prior to surgery) and postoperative CT (5 days after date of surgery) scans|Difference in Mandibular Angles, Comparison to assess structural reconstruction accuracy of postoperative versus preoperative cephalometrics. This will calculated as the absolute value of postoperative mandibular angle minus preoperative mandibular angle (degrees)., Assessed between preoperative CT (at least 6 days prior to surgery) and postoperative CT (5 days after date of surgery) scans|University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQoL), A questionnaire that measures quality of life which records responses on the 5-point Likert scale; minimum of 1 (strongly disagree) and maximum of 5 (strongly agree)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|EQ-5D-5L Survey, Another questionnaire which measures quality of life. Responses recorded as checkboxes that are ticked if applicable to the participant. Participant health is measured on a scale of 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Dysphagia, Measured through responses to the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) for assessment of dysphagia. MDADI records responses on the 5-point Likert scale; minimum of 1 (strongly disagree) and maximum of 5 (strongly agree)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Oral Health, Measured through responses to the General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Responses recorded one of 5 choices with a point value assigned to each (1 = always, 2 = often, 3 = sometimes, 4 = seldom, and 5 = never)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Fibula harvest site complications, Measured through responses to the Lower-Limb Tasks Questionnaire (LLTQ) if patient had fibula harvested for reconstruction. or the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, Hand (DASH) questionnaire if patients had scapula harvested for reconstruction. Intends to measure donor site morbidity by assessing ease of task completion (4 = no difficulty, 3 = mild difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty, 1 = severe difficulty, 0 = unable), as well as importance of task (4 = very important, 3 = moderately important, 2 = mildly important, 1 = not important)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Scapula harvest site complications, Measured through responses to the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, Hand (DASH) questionnaire if patients had scapula harvested for reconstruction. Intends to measure donor site morbidity by assessing difficulty during tasks (1 = no difficulty, 2 = mild difficulty, 3 = moderate difficulty, 4 = severe difficulty, 5 = unable)., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Economic analysis, Measured through responses to Health Utilization Questionnaire (HUQ) survey to measure impact to patients economic state as a result of their surgery. Records whether participant has experienced certain situations as no or yes (and asks frequency of these situations). Also asks for associated costs that may, Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Occlusal force (bite force), Measured through Dental PreScale System (DPS-Fujifilm Global) as an assessment of patient bite force., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery (4 visits total)|Dental Implantability, Oral surgeon on the trial will assess the feasibility of the creation of dental implants for the patient postoperatively; responses will recorded as either feasible (1) or infeasible (0)., Up to 100 days after the post-operative CT scan.|Operative Time, Time from first incision to the end of surgical closure as documented on the nursing record., Initial Surgery|Ischaemic Time, Time from cutting off blood supply to operative region to restoring blood supply and flow as documented on the nursing record., Initial Surgery|Length of Stay, Time from admission into hospital preoperatively to discharge from hospital postoperatively as documented on patient's medical chart or date of death, whichever came first., From date of patient's preoperative hospital admission until the date of hospital discharge postoperatively or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 days|Rate of Plate Extrusion, Complication with plate where may partially or fully be exposed to external environment., Patients will be monitored for 1 year post-operatively|Rate of Flap Failure, Complication with flap where donor bone no longer viable as reconstruction piece and replacement required. May be due to ischemic necrosis, infection, osteoradionecrosis, fracturing, etc., Patients will be monitored for 1 year post-operatively|Rate of Cancer Reoccurrence, Complication where cancer that was confirmed to be removed (negative resection margins, subsequent chemoradiotherapy results, etc.) reoccurs in the mandibular region. It does not have to be the same type or continuation of previous cancer; any cancer found within mandibular region postoperatively qualifies., Patients will be monitored for 1 year post-operatively|Adverse Events, Any additional complication or adverse event not covered by other secondary outcomes will be recorded from patient chart review and through a structured interview with the patients., Charts and interviews reviewed at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-surgery (6 visits total)|Occlusion, Extent of oral occlusion measured during in-person clinic assessments; can be recorded as normal occlusion, malocclusion Class I, malocclusion Class II, or malocclusion Class III., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery (4 visits total)|Jaw Mobility, Assessment of jaw freedom of movement will be taken during in-person clinic assessments; recorded as measurement of maximal mouth opening (millimeters) from top lip to bottom lip., Measure documented at time of baseline clinic visit and at 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery (4 visits total)
