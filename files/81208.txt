Influence of Food Preferences on the Occurrence of Undernutrition in Treated Patients for Bronchopulmonary Carcinoma Non-small Cell Stage IV
The study will be offered to patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed at stage IV and receiving first-line treatment.

The patient will benefit from a complete assessment at inclusion (clinical exam, imagery, biological exam, dietary consultation, test LFQP.

At the end of this 1st evaluation, patients in whom the diagnosis of undernutrition is made will benefit from dietary management with personalized advice that will take into account the symptoms of cancer, the possible side effects of treatments as well as the social environment.

Every two cures, i.e. every 4 to 6 weeks, these examens will be performed until the occurrence of an event (progression of the disease according to the RECIST criteria, death or change of therapeutic line). At the end of these assessments, patients will benefit from dietary management with a readjustment of personalized advice that will take into account the difficulties highlighted during the assessment.

OTHER: Test Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFQP-France)
Measurement of implicit wanting by the LFQP-France questionnaire, The food category with the highest implicit wanting score will be retained as characterizing the patient's food preferences. The 4 categories concerned are as follows:

* salty high in fat
* salty-low fat
* sweet-high fat
* sweet-low fat, During patient follow-up (12 months max)
The occurrence of undernutrition within 6 months after inclusion, in patients not undernourished at inclusion, The food category with the highest implicit wanting score will be retained as characterizing the patient's food preferences. The 4 categories concerned are as follows:

* salty high in fat
* salty-low fat
* sweet-high fat
* sweet-low fat, During 6 months|The impact of food preferences (liking and explicit wanting) assessed by the LFQP-France questionnaire on the prevalence and incidence of undernutrition in the 6 months after inclusion., The food category with the highest implicit wanting score will be retained as characterizing the patient's food preferences.
