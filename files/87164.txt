A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Profile of Rivoceranib With Paclitaxel in Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm, dose escalation and dose expansion Phase I/IIa study designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the safety and tolerability profile along with preliminary signs of efficacy of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of rivoceranib and paclitaxel when given in combination.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Rivoceranib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Phase I: Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) During Cycle 1, The number and proportion of participants experiencing DLTs will be reported by dose level, based on DLT observations during Cycle 1. Each Cycle is 28 days., Cycle 1 (first 28 days)|Phase I: Number of Participants Reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or participant temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed above., Up to 24 months|Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants who achieve objective tumor response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria for response., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months
Phase I: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Time to Maximum Observed Concentration (tmax), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-∞), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Terminal Half-life (t1/2), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Apparent Oral Plasma Clearance (CL/F), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: Terminal Rate Constant (λz), Day 1 & 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase I: ORR, ORR by RECIST 1.1, Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase I: Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as time from first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the time of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase I: Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the time of death from any cause., Ongoing assessment from enrollment until end of study, up to approximately 24 months|Phase I: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR or PR and stable disease (SD) at ≥12 weeks., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase I: Duration of Response, Defined as the time from first documentation of (complete response or partial response) to the first documentation of progression., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase II: PFS, Defined as time from first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the time of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase II: OS, OS is the time from first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the time of death from any cause., Ongoing assessment from enrollment until end of study, up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: DCR, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR or PR and SD at ≥12 weeks., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase II: Duration of Response, Defined as the time from first documentation of (complete response or partial response) to the first documentation of progression., Every other cycle (each cycle is 28 days) until end of study, assessed up to 24 months|Phase II: Number of Participants With AEs and SAEs, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Ongoing assessment from enrollment until end of study, approximately 24 months|Phase II: Concentration at the End of the Dosage Interval (Ctrough), Ctrough is characterized at steady state after single and multiple cycles of treatment., Ongoing assessment from enrollment until end of study, approximately 24 months
