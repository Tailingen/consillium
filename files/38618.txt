Study of Quality of Life in Older vs. Younger Adult Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This is a multi-center, Phase II, cross-sectional study comparing quality of life (QOL) as assessed by patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in older (≥65 years) adults vs younger (55-64 years) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

BEHAVIORAL: ePRO survey
Long-term post-HCT QOL (in particular physical function and fatigue) for transplant recipients ≥65 years old to those 55-64 years old., The primary objective is to compare the change in long-term post-HCT QOL (in particular physical function and fatigue) for transplant recipients ≥65 years old to those 55-64 years old as measured by the assessment and when the assessment occurred at a post-HCT timepoint., Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 6 months-1 year post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 1 year - 3 years post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint Greater than 3 years post-HCT
Domain-specific QOL scores by age group as assessed by PROMIS measures., 6 months-1 year post-HCT, 1 year - 3 years post-HCT, 3 years+ post-HCT|To explore the feasibility of electronic PROs (ePRO) collection in recipients ≥65 years old and to compare their compliance to that in recipients 55-64, by evaluating completion rate of the assessment by subjects by age group., Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 6 months-1 year post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 1 year - 3 years post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint Greater than 3 years post-HCT|To identify factors associated with poor compliance with reporting one-time single time ePRO measures in both age groups, by categorizing and quantifying reasons why subjects chose not to participate., Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 6 months-1 year post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint 1 year - 3 years post-HCT, Those completing the assessment at one timepoint Greater than 3 years post-HCT
Transplant recipients who have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and from participating study sites will be asked to complete an online consent and survey for the study. This survey is the patient-reported outcomes survey and will be used to assess quality of life. The survey results will then be compared by age group and by time post transplant, between 6 months and a year post transplant, 1 year to 3 years post transplant, and 3 years or more post transplant.
