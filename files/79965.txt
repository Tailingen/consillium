Decitabine, Venetoclax and Blinatumomab for Maintenance Following HSCT in Patients With Ph-Negative B-ALL
This study aims to evaluate whether maintenance therapy with decitabine, venetoclax and blinatumomab could improve the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of patients with philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had recently received an allogeneic stem cell transplant and in measurable residual disease-negative remission.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Decitabine, venetoclax and blinatumomab
PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the period from the date of allogenetic HSCT to the observed progression of the disease or the occurrence of death for any reason.(Progression is defined as more than 5% blast in the peripheral blood or bone marrow biopsy.), From date of allogenetic HSCT until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years after allogenetic HSCT
OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the period from the date of allogenetic HSCT to the date of death., 2 years after allogenetic HSCT|CIR, Cumulative incidence of relapse（CIR）is measured from the date of achievement of remission until the date of hematologic relapse, or MRD relapse. Patients who died without relapsing are counted as a competing cause of failure., 2 years after allogenetic HSCT|TEAE, Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; frequency, CTCAE grade） is defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study treatment until 30 days from the end., From the start of each cycle to 30 days after the end|GRFS, GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) is defined as the time from the date of allogenetic HSCT until the date of treatment-emergent acute GVHD III-IV, or treatment-emergent chronic GVHD that requires new or additional immunosuppressive treatment, or morphological relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years after allogenetic HSCT
This is a phase Ⅱ, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study in patients with philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had recently received an allogeneic stem cell transplant and in minimal residual disease-negative remission. In this study, patients will be treated with 4 cycles of maintence therapies for up to one year (or until intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal, or study termination). In cycle one and three, patients will receive decitabine monotherapy, and in cycle two and four, patients will receive a combination of venetoclax and blinatumomab. This study aims to evaluate whether maintenance therapy with decitabine, venetoclax and blinatumomab could improve the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of those patients, and explore the efficiency and safety.
