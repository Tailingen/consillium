Efficiency of Vaccination with Lysate-loaded Dendritic Cells in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether overall survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with lysate-loaded, mature dendritic cell vaccines as add-on to the standard of care consisting of resection, radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy and subsequent adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy is superior to the treatment with the standard of care alone.
Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous, tumor lysate-loaded, mature dendritic cells (DC)|DRUG: standard therapy
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival as measured from the day of surgery until death from any cause assessed up to 34 months, Day of surgery until death of any cause assessed up to 34 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival as measured from the day of surgery until diagnosis of tumor progression by MRI scan according to modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria assessed up to 34 months, Day of surgery until day of diagnosis of tumor progression assessed upto 34 months|OS rates, OS rates at 6, 12 and 24 months after the day of surgery, 6, 12 and 24 months after the day of surgery|PFS rates, PFS rates at 6, 12 and 24 months after the day of surgery, 6, 12 and 24 months after the day of surgery|Frequency and severity of adverse events, Safety based on the frequency and severity of adverse events (AE) with toxicity graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.03 (CTCAE 4.03), 34 months|Karnofsky Performance Status, Overall and neurological performance based on the Karnofsky performance status (MMSE-2), 34 months|MMSE-2, Overall and neurological performance based on the Minimal Mental State Examination 2 (MMSE-2), 34 months|Quality of life of cancer patients, Quality of life as determined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 3.0, 34 months|Quality of life in patients with brain cancer, Quality of life as determined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Brain Cancer Module QLQ-BN20, 34 months|Psychological distress in oncology patients, Quality of life as determined by the Distress Thermometer (DT), 34 months|Psychological distress, anxiety and depression, Quality of life as determined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for psycho-oncological strain assessment, 34months
This is a multicenter, randomized, phase 2 study, integrating vaccination with tumorlysate-loaded mature dendritic cells into standard radio/temozolomide-chemotherapy of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with near-complete resection after fluorescence-guided resection. Only patients with confirmed gross-total resection and a residual tumor volume below 5 ml will be eligible for the trial. Vaccination will be performed after radio- and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy and during the first three cycles of adjuvant TMZ.
