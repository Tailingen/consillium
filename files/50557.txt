SHR - A1811 Injection in the Treatment of Platinum-sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This study is a multi - center, single - arm, open - label, phase Ib/II clinical trial for dose exploration and efficacy expansion. The aim is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and immunogenicity of the combination regimen of SHR - A1811 in the treatment of platinum - sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination therapy, and preliminarily assess its efficacy.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A1811|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR):, Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). For responses categorized as CR or PR, confirmation is required through a subsequent evaluation performed no less than 4 weeks (â‰¥28 days) after the initial assessment., 5 Years after treatment.
Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the time from the first date a subject is assessed as having a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to the first date of either Progressive Disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 5 Years after treatment.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., 5 Years after treatment.|Response Rate (RR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall response assessed as either a response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or a response according to the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA - 125 criteria., 5 Years after treatment.|CA - 125 Response Rate (CA - 125 RR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with a response evaluated according to the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA - 125 criteria., 5 Years after treatment.|Progression Free Survival, Progression - Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by the Independent Radiological Review Committee (IRC) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). It is defined as the time from the randomization date of the subject to the first date of documented radiological tumor progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 5 Years after treatment.|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the randomization date to death due to any cause in subjects., 5 Years after treatment.
