A Study of Injection HB002.1T in Subjects With Solid Tumor
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of HB002.1T, a human immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein containing domain 2 and flanking sequence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 in subjects with solid tumor.
