Nimotuzumab Combined With VMAT in Elderly Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Nimotuzumab combined with VMAT in the treatment of elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (\> 70 years old), and to provide high-level clinical evidence for the optimal treatment of elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The incidence of elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is increasing with a rapidly ageing population. However, the prognosis is worse than that of young patients. Some patients can benefit from intensive treatment such as concurrent chemoradiotherapy, but are always with obvious toxicity. With the advancement of radiotherapy technology and the emergence of molecular targeted drugs, radiotherapy combined with Nimotuzumab has shown good therapeutic efficacy and tolerance. The investigators plan to testify VMAT combined with Nimotuzumab in elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
