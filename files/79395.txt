Phase III Study of Camrelizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III clinical study. Target population is patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin with placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in study population in China. camrelizumab is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.

In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept study treatment. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be at most 6 weeks which will be decided by investigators. Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) will be the primary outcome measures.
