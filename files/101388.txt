Using Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cells to Model Cancer Therapy-Related Adverse Events
This study is being done to find out if patient blood samples can be used to perform individualized modeling of cancer therapy-related side effects.
Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm|Malignant Solid Neoplasm
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
In vitro measurement of cellular viability in response to chemotherapy, Will be compared between cells derived from patients who experienced treatment-induced toxicity to cells derived from patients who received the same cancer therapy without toxicity. Statistical analyses of different endpoints will use Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA test followed by all-pairwise-multiple-comparison procedures, or an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test with significant differences defined by P \< 0.05., Blood drawn at enrollment to obtain sample
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC's) from patients receiving cancer treatment.

II. Differentiate patient iPSC's into cardiomyocytes and/or neurons or other cell types that may be relevant to modeling cancer therapy-related adverse effects, such as cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity.

III. Use patient specific iPSC-derived cells to:

IIIa. Model cancer therapy-related toxicities; IIIb. Better understand the mechanisms of toxicities; IIIc. Determine if patient specific genetic variants are causative of toxicities; IIId. Screen novel protective therapies for cancer therapy-related toxicities.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo blood sample collection and have their medical records reviewed on study.
