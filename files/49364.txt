A Study of T3011 in Patients With BCG-Unresponsive High Risk NMIBC
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of intravesical administration of Herpes Virus T3011 Injection in participants with BCG-unresponsive high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) .

This is a Phase II clinical study to explore the safety, tolerability, RP2D and preliminary efficacy of T3011 as a single agent in participants with BCG-unresponsive high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). T3011 will be intravesically administered in the entire solution volume of 50ml.

T3011 will be intravesically administered with the two selected dose levels, the lower dose level of 2×10\^9 PFU and the higher level of 1×10\^10 PFU.

In the dose expansion period, 2×10\^9 PFU dose level will be supposed as the 1st expansion dose. 1×10\^10 PFU dose level will be selected as the 2nd expansion dose if no safety concerns after DLT assessment. 15-30 participants are planned to be firstly enrolled in the two dose levels respectively to determine RP2D. Once RP2D is confirmed, more participants will only continue to be enrolled on RP2D dose level no less than 40 participants totally.
