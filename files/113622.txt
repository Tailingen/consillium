Efficacy of Preoperative Intravenous Iron in Anaemic Colorectal Cancer Surgical Patients
Iron deficiency anaemia is a common condition among colorectal surgical patient. Untreated anaemia would lead to increase in blood transfusion, surgical complications and mortality. Treatment with oral iron sulphate is poorly tolerated due to side effects. Intravenous iron supplement provides an alternative way to rapidly replace iron deficit during the preoperative period among surgical patients. Evidence is growing for its effect in rising hemoglobin level and reducing blood transfusion, at the same time supporting its safety profile.

The investigators plan for a single-centered, randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of intravenous iron compared to standard care in terms of hemoglobin level/serum ferritin increment, need for blood transfusion, duration of hospital stay, quality of recovery and surgical complication rate, as well as safety profile among colorectal cancer surgical patients in Hong Kong. The investigator propose the following pilot RCT for exploring the effect size and study process in conducting the above-mentioned large-scale RCT.
