Pulsed Low Dose Rate Radiation With Concurrent Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Esophageal Cancer
Phase I study with the hypothesis that Pulsed Low Dose Radiation (PLDR) radiation delivery technique can significantly decrease the rate of severe acute esophagitis in patients receiving concurrent Chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) for non-small cell lung cancer or esophageal cancer while maintaining similar efficacy. For these patients, the rate of severe acute esophagitis during concurrent CRT is high (approximately 20%) when conventional external beam radiation is utilized. Severe acute esophagitis can cause many adverse consequences such as severe discomfort, weight loss, hospitalization, interruption/early termination of treatment, and worse surgical complications for those who receive surgery after CRT. PLDR radiation has the potential to maintain the tumor control rates of conventional radiation while decreasing the toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue 29-35.

We have completed accrual to a phase I PLDR radiation study, in which patient received palliative re-irradiation with PLDR technique for their metastatic disease in previous irradiated field. In that phase I study, PLDR demonstrated safety for acute toxicities in the setting of re-irradiation for a total dose of 50 Gy, with analysis of 60 Gy pending. The follow up time for that phase I study is limited as most enrolled patients have short overall survival due to their terminal illness.

This proposed phase I study is, to our knowledge, the first clinical study with combination of PLDR radiation and concurrent chemotherapy for definitive treatment.

RADIATION: Pulsed Low Dose Radiation|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Rate of severe acute esophagitis in patients with lung cancer and esophageal cancer treated with concurrent CRT using PLDR technique., The investigator will evaluate the severity of other adverse events using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0)., 2 years
Quality of life, Quality of life will be evaluated based on a quality of life survey conducted at different time-points during the study. After entering in the study survey will be conducted in 1st month , 2nd month ,3rd month, 6th month, 9th month. Number of surveys conducted will be the same however a delay due toxicity is possible and therefore last survey could be collected up to 12 months., 1 year|Progression free survival, progression free survival will be evaluated from the day of first treatment until disease progression, 1-5 years|Response rate based, Response rate will be evaluated based on the outcome of surgical pathology, 1 year
