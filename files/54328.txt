Study on the Incidence of Febrile Episodes During Stem Cells Collection After Chemotherapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
To evaluate the difference in the incidence of febrile episodes in patients undergoing stem cells mobilization with chemotherapy and filgrastim versus chemotherapy and lenograstim.

A febrile episode will be considered as: body temperature \> 38°C for two measurements in the 24 hours with an interval of 6 hours at least between the two measurements.
