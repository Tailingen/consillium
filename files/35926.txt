Assessment of the Prognosis of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using 3D MRE
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), representing 85-95% of pancreatic cancers, is a highly lethal malignancy with a dismal 5-year survival rate below 8%. Emerging evidence highlights the critical need for non-invasive imaging biomarkers to stratify prognosis and guide therapeutic strategies. Notably, the biomechanical properties of PDAC-associated extracellular matrix (ECM), characterized by extensive interstitial fibrosis, are intrinsically linked to tumorigenesis, progression, and metastatic dissemination. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance elastography (3D-MRE), as an advanced imaging modality, enables precise quantification of tissue shear stiffness in both normal pancreatic parenchyma and neoplastic lesions. Significantly, the biomechanical heterogeneity captured by MRE holds untapped potential to serve as a prognostic biomarker for PDAC. Despite its technical merits, no studies to date have systematically explored MRE-derived imaging signatures in predicting PDAC survival outcomes or therapeutic responses, underscoring a pivotal gap in translational oncology research.

Analyzing the measurement accuracy of MRE., The hardness was measured by a hardness tester during the operation, and the mechanical parameters were measured by atomic force microscopy of the in vitro specimen. The measurement accuracy of MRE was analyzed by comparing the hardness tester and atomic force microscope results., 9 months|Radiological assessment of tumor stiffness, A self-written script program in MATLAB is used to read and analyze mechanical group diagrams and waveform diagrams in three directions of x, y, and z, and a region of interest (ROI) delineation function is embedded. After drawing the ROI, an Excel file containing the corresponding values is automatically generated, and the average values of various mechanical parameters are calculated, including shear modulus (\|G\*\|, SS), storage modulus (G', SM), loss modulus (G'', LM) and damping ratio (#, DR)., 9 months|Evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy., RECIST criteria (version 1.1) were used to objectively evaluate the response to chemotherapy., 12 months|Investigating the correlation between magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) shear stiffness and clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients., Optimize longitudinal follow-up for pancreatic cancer patient subgroups. Utilizing shear stiffness measurements from magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and clinical outcomes among distinct patient groups, generate Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine the clinical utility of biomechanical characterization in prognosticating pancreatic cancer. Statistical analyses were conducted with R and GraphPad Prism., 9 months
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), constituting 85-95% of pancreatic cancers, ranks among the most lethal malignancies globally, with a dismal 5-year survival rate below 8%. Identifying robust prognostic or predictive biomarkers is critical for risk stratification and prospective therapeutic evaluation in clinical trials. The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding PDAC is characterized by extensive interstitial fibrosis, a pathological hallmark intrinsically linked to tumor initiation, progression, and metastatic dissemination. While the ECM exerts dual roles in modulating cancer biology through multifaceted mechanisms, compelling experimental evidence confirms that ECM stiffening in PDAC accelerates tumor aggressiveness and correlates significantly with reduced patient survival. Noninvasive quantification of tumor mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness) prior to treatment could provide critical insights into tumor biology, prognostic stratification, and personalized therapeutic decision-making.

Advanced three-dimensional magnetic resonance elastography (3D-MRE) enables precise, noninvasive mapping of shear stiffness across both healthy pancreatic tissue and neoplastic lesions. Despite its technical promise, the translational potential of MRE-derived imaging biomarkers for predicting PDAC prognosis remains unexplored, with no systematic studies reported domestically or internationally to date.
