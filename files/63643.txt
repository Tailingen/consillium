mTORC1/mTORC2 Kinase Inhibitor AZD2014 in Previously Treated Glioblastoma Multiforme
The standard or usual treatment for this disease is standard chemotherapy alone. AZD2014 is a new type of drug for glioblastoma multiforme. In the laboratory it has been shown to slow the growth of glioblastoma multiforme. In some animal studies AZD2014 seemed to work better when given with a drug called temozolomide.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: AZD2014
Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of AZD2014, Day 0
Number and severity of adverse events, 30 months|Response rate per RANO criteria, 30 months|To evaluate the plasma levels of AZD2014 alone at the time of resection, 30 months
The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of AZD2014 that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects when receiving temozolomide and see what good and/or bad effects AZD2014 can have on the tumour. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that we know can be given safely to the participants when used on its own. Participants are given AZD2014 together with temozolomide and will be watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of AZD2014. Participants joining this study later on will get higher doses of AZD2014 than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
