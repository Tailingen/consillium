Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (123I mIBG) Scintigraphy in Patients Being Evaluated for Phaeochromocytoma or Neuroblastoma
The study is designed to study the effectiveness of 123I-mIBG as a diagnostic imaging agent in evaluating patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma or phaeochromocytoma.
Pheochromocytoma|Neuroblastoma
DRUG: 123I-mIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine)
- To demonstrate that 123I-mIBG planar scintigraphy is sensitive and specific in confirming or excluding the diagnoses of neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma.
To determine the incremental value of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for improving the sensitivity and specificity of 123I-mIBG planar scintigraphy for the diagnoses of neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma.|To collect safety data on 123I-mIBG.
