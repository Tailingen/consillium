68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer: Clinical Stage and Restage
To evaluate the dosimetry, safety and the detection rate of 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT for identifying the site of prostate cancer metastasis and relapse. It is also to evaluate the association of clinical/pathologic features and 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT detection rate and compare 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT with other imaging procedure.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68Ga-Labeled PSMA|DRUG: Non-labeled PSMA
The maximal standard uptake value, The tumor SUVmax of patients will be measured using Region Of Interest., 2 years|The measurement of PSA, The PSA level (ng/mL) of patients will be tested by hemanalysis, 2 years|68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer: clinical stage and restage, Visual analysis will be carried out by 4 experienced nuclear medicine physicians to observe the uptake of 68Ga-THP-PSMA in prostate malignant lesions. A 4 point method will be used to interpret the scans for abnormalities. It is categorized as such: score 0, no abnormal increased uptake; score 1, low increased uptake; score 2, moderate increased uptake; score 3, high increased uptake. The lesion will be considered positive for malignancy if the score is 2 or higher., 2 years
The correlation analysis, The IHC results of prostate malignant lesions will be used as golden standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT., 2 years|The dosimetry assessment, To evaluate the dosimetry of 68Ga-THP-PSMA, patients (n = 5) will undergo whole-body planar imaging at different time points (10 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after injection) to obtain radiation dosimetry data. A calibration source of 37 MBq at injection time will be placed above the head of each patient to provide quantitative calibration of counts to activity., 2 years|The safety evaluation, Drug-related adverse reactions will be recorded during the 7-d follow-up period., 2 years
