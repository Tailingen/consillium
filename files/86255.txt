Anti-cancer Neoantigen Polypeptide Vaccine to Treat Solid Tumors
The WES and RAN-seq will be performed to identify and verify neoantigens and appropriate polypeptide sequences will be verified, manufactured and protected for vaccine production by multiple in vitro and in vivo studies. Clinical studies will be performed to test anti-cancer function of the polypeptide vaccine for immunotherapy of human cancer patients. In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the polypeptide vaccine immunotherapy on human cancers will firstly be evaluated.
Solid Tumor, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: Neoantigen Polypeptide Vaccine
Number of Patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity, A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the vaccine, which is irreversible, or life threatening or hematologic or non-hematologic Grade 3-5., Six months
Percent of Patients with best response as either complete remission or partial remission., Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients whose best response is either complete remission or partial remission by combining the data from the patients. To compare with historical data, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the response rate., Six months
1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced solid cancers, with written consent for this study;
2. Perform biopsy to get fresh sample for DNA/RNA-seqencings and bioinformatics analysis;
3. Produce appropriate polypeptide vaccine for human use and deliver the vaccine into selected patients via local injections, and follow up closely to collect related results as required;
4. To enhance the killing capability, cotreatment the patients with PD1/PDL1/CTLA4 antibodies may be applied;
5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
