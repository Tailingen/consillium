Benign Tumors|Malignant Tumors|Vascular Malformation
BIOLOGICAL: Bioseal
Proportion of success (watertight closure) CSF leakage, no CSF leakage from dural repair intra-operatively, 5 to 10 seconds after final Valsalva maneuver
Incidence of CSF leakage, Incidence of CSF leakage post-surgery to discharge, Up to Discharge, an average of 3-5days in general|Incidence of CSF leakage, Incidence of CSF leakage 30 (±7) days post operatively, Up to 30(+/-7)Days|Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of adverse events, Up to 30(±7)Days|Incidence of surgical site infections (SSI), Incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) according to Surgical Site Infection Infection Prevention and Control Guideline (MOH) criteria, Up to 30(± 7) days
This is a randomized, single blinded, multi-center controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of Bioseal as an adjunct to sutured dural closure compared to control to obtain an intra-operative watertight dural closure.
