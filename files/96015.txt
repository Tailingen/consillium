Open Label Study to Analyze the Effect of Telotristat Ethyl on Weight Regulation/Gain
This single arm study will evaluate whether Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) associated weight gain is affects lean body mass, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning among neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with a history of carcinoid syndrome.
Pancreatic Cancer|Neuroendocrine Tumors|Cachexia; Cancer
DRUG: telotristat ethyl
Mean change in lean body mass (measured using DXA Scan) from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks after treatment
Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) from baseline up to 3 years post treatment., The summary score (SS) is a mean of 13 QLQ-C30 subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher SS rating reflecting a better health status., From baseline to 3 years post treatment|Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test from baseline up to 3 years post treatment., MOCA scores range between 0 and 30, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive function., From baseline to 3 years post treatment|Mean change in patient reported outcomes using a stool survey measured from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment., The stool survey is a non-validated descriptive measure of gastrointestinal symptoms by taking the mean score on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 indicates no symptoms and higher scores denote a worsening of symptoms., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment.|Mean change in calories consumed using a 24-hour food diary from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment|Mean change in daily activity levels (steps) as measured using a wrist-worn fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit) from baseline and for the duration of the 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment|Mean change in daily activity levels [stairs (floors) climbed] as measured using a wrist-worn fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit) from baseline and for the duration of the 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment|Mean change in daily activity levels (sleep duration) as measured using a wrist-worn fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit) from baseline and for the duration of the 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment|Mean change in daily activity levels (heart rate) as measured using a wrist-worn fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit) from baseline and for the duration of the 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment|Mean change in daily activity levels (active minutes) as measured using a wrist-worn fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit) from baseline and for the duration of the 13 weeks of treatment., From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment
The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of weight gain associated with the drug telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) among patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with history of carcinoid syndrome. We want to know if taking Xermelo affects patients' lean body mass, quality of life, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning during treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of weight gain from Xermelo may allow us to determine whether this drug may be beneficial for treating carcinoid syndrome, cachexia, or weight loss seen in other diseases.
