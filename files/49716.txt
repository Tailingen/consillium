Functional Voice and Speech Outcomes Following Surgical Voice Restorations: A Comparison of Pharyngeal Construction Approaches
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nature and quality of speech after removal of the voice box and all or part of the swallowing tube.

The study is evaluating which type of surgery provides patients with the best speech and voice.

These data will be used to help surgeons to design better ways to restore voice function after removal of the voice box. Information about disease, its treatment, quality of life, and physical and vocal function will be collected. An audio recording of vocal tasks will also be done. All of this information will be analyzed and the two different subject groups will be compared to see if there are differences.
Larynx Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: questionnaires and standardized, digital voice recording
Determine the pertinent differences in objective and subjective voice parameters between PR techniques, specifically comparing those techniques that provide mucosal lining (jejunum) to those with cutaneous lining (radial forearm flap)., conclusion of study
Provide physician with meaningful and relevant data upon which to base the optimal choice of pharyngeal reconstruction method for individual patients who must undergo laryngectomy with pharyngeal reconstruction for the treatment of carcinoma., conclusion of study
