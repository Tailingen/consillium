Quality of Friendships in Children With Neurofibromatosis
The aim of this study is to determine if children with a higher disease severity have lower quality friendships than children who are less severely affected and children who are unaffected. Researchers will test the hypothesis that the quality of friendships is inversely related to their disease severity.

Specific Aims:

1. To use the FQQ to determine if the quality of friendships in children with NF1 is lower than the quality of friendships in unaffected children.
2. To use a disease severity scale and the FQQ to determine if children who are less severely affected have higher friendship qualities than children who are more severely affected.
Neurofibromatosis
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire
Disease severity scale and Friendship Quality Questionnaire (FQQ), Questionnaire completion by patient and chart review by doctor for disease severity scoring.
You (your) child will be asked to complete a short questionnaire (40 questions) about their relationship with their best friend. Doctors will review your (child's) medical chart to find out how severe the disease is, so that this may be compared to the answers you have (your child has) given on the friendship questionnaire.

This is an Investigational Study. About 90-100 children and adolescents with NF-1 will be asked to take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.
