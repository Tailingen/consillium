Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma of the Adult: Randomization Between High Dose Chemotherapy With Rituximab and CHOP 14-Rituximab
The aim of the protocol is to compare the outcome of patients with DLBCL stage II bulky, III or IV with 1 to 3 adverse prognostic factors according to the International prognostic index. Patients with eligibility criteria and who gave informed consent will be randomised between CHOP-14- Rituximab x 8 courses and High dose chemotherapy with rituximab including autologous stem cell support. The aim of the study is to compare the Event free survival between the two arms and to gain insight into the prognostic significance of several biological markers gathered at the time of diagnosis/randomisation ( i.e. Fcgamma R III A genotyping, DNA profile and BCL é expression).
