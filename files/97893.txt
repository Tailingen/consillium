PRISM for Depression and Anxiety in Young Adults With Cancer
This research study is being done to test the feasibility of an existing supportive program (PRISM) to address psychological symptoms (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms) that young adult participants diagnosed with cancer or desmoid tumor may experience.

The name of the intervention used in this research study is:

-Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) Program

BEHAVIORAL: Promoting Resilience in Stress Management Program
Rate of PRISM Intervention Completion, Feasibility is defined as 70% of PRISM sessions are completed by participants who start the study., Up to 12 weeks|Rate of Study Assessment Completion, Study feasibility is defined as 70% of all study assessments are completed by participants who complete PRISM sessions., Up to 12 weeks|Participant Satisfaction, Acceptability of the PRISM intervention will be determined by responses on semi-structured exit interviews using descriptive statistics and scores on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- (CSQ-8), an 8-item measuring a participant's opinions and assessment of the intervention. Total scores range from 8 to 32 with a higher number indicating greater satisfaction., At final intervention session, up to 6 weeks
mPRISM Phone Application Usage, The feasibility of the mPRISM phone application as a tool to practice PRISM skills, as evidenced by the participant usage metrics., Up to 12 weeks|Questionnaires, The feasibility of using the assessment questionnaires in the current study (e.g., length, administration), Up to 12 weeks
This research study is being done to test the initial feasibility and acceptability of a six-session, skills-based resilience coaching intervention, Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM; Rosenberg et al., 2018; Rosenberg et al., 2021), that targets four resilience resources (stress management, goal setting, cognitive reframing, and meaning-making) for young adult patients (18-30 years old) with cancer or desmoid tumor who are treated with curative intent and who report moderate depressive and/or anxiety symptoms.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, completing one diagnostic assessment of depressive and anxiety symptoms, pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaires, completion of the six-session PRISM intervention, and a semi-structured exit interview about the experience with the PRISM intervention.

Participation in this research study is expected to last approximately 2 to 3 months.

It is expected that up to 15 young adults with cancer (i.e., participants) and up to a total of 15 support persons (i.e., friends or family members who participants will have an option to invite for the final session of the intervention) will take part in this research study.
