Analysis of Extraperitoneal Rectal Neoplasms Between 3D Endorectal Ultrasonography and Magnification Chromoendoscopy
ERUS-3D and CMI demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy in parietal staging of rectal extraperitoneal neoplasms, however with greater efficiency of the endoscopic method. The association of studies can improve diagnostic efficacy and influence the most appropriate approach.
Rectal Cancer|Rectal Cancer Stage I
PROCEDURE: three-dimensional endorectal ultrasonography
Degree of parietal invasion (T),, Patients with Stage T after procedure, immediately after the procedure
Larger lesions present less chance of deep parietal invasion. The methods show moderate agreement with each other for lesion size and distance from the anal verge and good agreement for the rectal wall percentage of involvement. Circumferential or almost circumferential lesions have a greater chance of postoperative stenosis. Patients with more advanced lesions on AP who underwent radical resections had lower overall survival.
