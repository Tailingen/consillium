Molecular Assessment for Gastro-Esophageal Cancer
The goal of this minimally invasive interventional study is to learn if oncometabolic biomarkers, detected in the exhaled breath and blood can identify early-stage gastro-oesophageal cancer in patient at risk for gastro-oesophageal cancer.

The main questions this study aims to answer:

Are oncometabolites proficient and reproducible enough to function as diagnostic biomarkers? Can these biomarkers identify early-stage gastro-esophageal cancer? Researchers will compare participants with gastro-oesophageal cancer to healthy controls and participants with Barrett's esophagus to detect meaningful differences between the groups.

Participants will provide a breath and blood sample during their routine standard of care visits.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Barrett Esophagus
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breath analysis|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood analysis
Identification of the concentrations of oncometabolites, Identify the concentrations of cancer-related metabolites (oncometabolites) in the exhaled breath and blood compared to healthy controls, year 1-2
Assessment of incidence of early-stage cancer, Distinguish early-stage gastro-oesophageal cancer from Barrett's esophagus and healthy controls based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the oncometabolite concentration, year 2-5|Assessment of incidence of therapy response, Predict and assess therapy response prior to surgery, based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the oncometabolite concentration, year 2-5|Assessment of percentage change of therapy response, Assess changes in the concentrations of the oncometabolites related to treatment., year 2-5|Assessment of incidence of recurrence, Predict and assess recurrence, based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the oncometabolite concentration, year 2-5
