The Individualized Treatment of 6-mercaptopurine in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in China
The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of individualized treatment of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and to investigate the dose-concentration-response (DER) relationship between thiopurine metabolites and adverse events. The individualized administration of 6-MP was established in Chinese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Pediatric
DRUG: 6-mercaptopurine|PROCEDURE: Standard treatment|PROCEDURE: Individualized treatment
leukopenia, Leukopenia was graded by common toxicity criteria as follows: Grade 3, 1.0-2.0 × 109/L, and Grade 4, \< 1.0 × 109/L., 6 weeks|thiopurine-induced leukopenia, Resolution of leukopenia was determined after 6-MP dose reduction or discontinuation, both in the absence of other apparent causes for the leukopenia or its disappearance., 6-weeks
hepatotoxicity, Hepatotoxicity was defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels 2-fold above the upper limit without cytolysis., 6 weeks|6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) concentrations in erythrocytes., Peripheral blood samples were obtained from steady-state plasma concentrates by opportunistic sampling design., 3 months|6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMPN) concentrations in erythrocytes., Peripheral blood samples were obtained from steady-state plasma concentrates by opportunistic sampling design., 3 months
To inflict minimal pain on the child contributing blood samples, opportunistic sampling design was chosen to collect pharmacokinetic samples.
