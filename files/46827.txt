Phase II Gallium Nitrate in Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Eligible patients will have low- or intermediate-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. Patients will receive gallium nitrate 300 mg/m2/day by continuous IV infusion for 7 consecutive days using a portable infusion pump. Hospitalization is not required. Stable or responding patients will receive additional gallium nitrate infusions every 3 weeks until the time of disease progression, for a maximum total of 8 infusions, or 2 cycles after complete remission has been documented.

DRUG: gallium nitrate
This study seeks to define the role of gallium nitrate in a specific population of patients who are expected to have received prior therapy. Preliminary clinical studies have suggested substantial evidence of antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate.
