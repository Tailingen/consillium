Nilotinib Pre and Post Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
Current therapeutic results in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are rather disappointing. Most of these patients will eventually undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Nilotinib is a novel TKI tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 30 fold more potency than Imatinib. Based on previous preliminary experience the author we rationalize that Nilotinib therapy pre- allogeneic transplantation for patients with advanced CML and Ph+ALL will reduce tumor mass pre- transplant achieving a state of minimal residual disease (MRD) and therefore may improve transplantation outcome without increasing toxicity. In addition it will allow time for improving patient medical condition and for finding an unrelated donor which will enable allogeneic transplantation , and to induce anti tumor effect post PBSC w\\o DLI ( donor lymphocyte infusion)
