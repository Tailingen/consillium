This prospective phase II study is to assess the efficacy and safety of thoracic re-irradiation for locoregionally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer using hypofractionated technique.

1. For peripherally located recurrent tumors, stereotactic body radiation therapy is used at 5000-6000 cGy in 10 fractions.
2. For centrally located recurrent tumors, adaptive hypofractionated radiation is used: Patients are irradiated at 3000-4000cGy in 6-10 daily fractions in the first course. After a four-week interval, patients who have non-progressive disease and an adequate pulmonary function undergo adaptive re-planning, and are irradiated at 2400-3500cGy in 4\~7 daily fractions as a boost. Concurrent chemotherapy consists of weekly docetaxel and nedaplatin.
