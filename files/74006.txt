Study of CX1106 in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
CX1106 is a novel inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) developed as a potential antitumor agent by virtue of the rate limiting role of TS in the biosynthesis of thymidine. CX1106 differs from other TS inhibitors such as pemetrexed, raltitrexed, CB3717, and fluorouracil in that it does not require active transport for uptake into cells. CX1106 also lacks a glutamate moiety and thus does not require polyglutamation for antitumor activity. More than 1000 patients with various malignancies have been treated with CX1106 to date in previous various clinical trials.

The investigators suggest a study of CX1106 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who are resistant or ineligible/intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of CX1106.
