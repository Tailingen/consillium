Hepatic Arterial Infusion With Floxuridine and Dexamethasone Combination With Chemotherapy With/Without Bevacizumab for Hepatic Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab, to hepatic arterial therapy with floxuridine (FUDR) and dexamethasone (Dex) (regional chemotherapy), and either oxaliplatin or CPT-11, plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (systemic chemotherapy) will increase disease free survival in patients who have undergone liver resection. The patient will be randomized (a computer generated decision as in the flip of a coin) to receive, or not to receive bevacizumab in addition to regional and systemic chemotherapy.
Hepatic Metastases|Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab HAI plus systemic chemotherapy|DRUG: HAI plus systemic chemotherapy
To determine whether the addition of concurrent intravenous bevacizumab to HAI plus systemic chemotherapy increases the time to progression in patients with completely resected hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, 7.5 months
To assess toxicity, 7.5 months|To determine survival, 2 years|To assess the expression pattern of VEGFR1, VEGFR2 (angiogenesis), and VEGFR3 (lymphangiogenesis) and their cognate ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D), and correlate with patient progression and survival following, 2 years|To compare plasma levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and CD133+ VEGFR2+ circulating endothelial progenitors, 2 years
