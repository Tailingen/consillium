The Role of Extracellular DNA (ecDNA) in the Occurrence and Development of Gastric
ECDNA is almost non-existent in normal cells, but exists in nearly half of human cancer cells, indicating that studying such abnormal DNA is of great significance for our understanding of tumor formation and evolution. The changes in ecDNA expression in intestinal type gastric cancer may be closely related to the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. Dynamic monitoring of changes in ecDNA expression in the gastric mucosa may help predict the occurrence of gastric cancer and guide subsequent treatment. By collaborating with multiple endoscopic centers to conduct gastroscopy biopsies on patients with gastric precancerous lesions, we aim to further explore the role of ecDNA in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer through continuous follow-up.
