Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, as determined by the investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1., From baseline to progressive disease or death (approximately 1 year)|The number of subjects with adverse events/serious adverse events, Number of patients with adverse events and with serious adverse events including abnormal clinical observations, abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, abnormal laboratory assessments and abnormal vital signs that changed from baseline., Throughout the treatment and the safety follow-up period 28 [+ 7] days after the discontinuation of all study interventions, except durvalumab, nivolumab, and bevacizumab for which it will be 90 [+ 7] days (approximately 1 year)|PSA50 response (Substudy 3 only), Proportion of participants achieving a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result, confirmed by a second consecutive PSA assessment at least 3 weeks later., From baseline to PSA response evaluated according to the PCWG3 criteria (up to 12 weeks)|Progression free survival (PFS) response (Substudy 4C only), PFS is defined as time from start of treatment until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause., From baseline to progressive disease or death (approximately 1 year)
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from start of treatment until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause., From baseline to progressive disease or death (approximately 1 year)|Duration Of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed response until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator or death., From baseline to progressive disease or death (approximately 1 year)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR at 12 and 24 weeks is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) in the first 13 and 25 weeks or who have Stable disease (SD) for at least 11 and 23 weeks after the date of first dose respectively, per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator at local site and derived from the raw tumour data., At 12 and 14 weeks|Best percentage change in tumour size, The best percentage change from baseline in tumour size will be derived as the maximum reduction from baseline or (in the absence of reduction) the minimum increase from baseline., From baseline to progressive disease or death (approximately 1 year)|Pharmacokinetics of Dato-DXd (all substudies) and volrustomig and rilvegostomig (substudy 6): Maximum plasma concentration of the drug (Cmax), The concentration in plasma will be determined., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 1 year)|Pharmacokinetics of Dato-DXd (all substudies) and volrustomig and rilvegostomig (substudy 6): The time taken to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), The concentration in plasma will be determined., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 1 year)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Dato-DXd (all substudies) and volrustomig and rilvegostomig (substudy 6): Area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC), The concentration in plasma will be determined. Area under the curve is the integral of the concentration-time curve. The AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug after administration. The AUC is dependent on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the dose administered., At predefined intervals throughout the treatment period (approximately 1 year)|Plasma concentration of Total anti-TROP2 antibody, Expression of TROP2 will be measured in blood sample, Throughout the treatment period at pre-defined intervals (approximately 1 year)|Plasma concentration of MAAA-1181a, The concentration in plasma will be determined (Cmax will be derived)., Throughout the treatment period at pre-defined intervals (approximately 1 year)|Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) for Dato-DXd (all substudies) and volrustomig and rilvegostomig (substudy 6), Whole blood samples for determination of ADA in plasma will be collected; Percentage of patients who develop ADA, Throughout the treatment period at pre-defined intervals and including the safety follow-up period (approximately 1 year)|Radiographic PFS (Substudy 3), PFS is defined as time from start of treatment until radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator or death., From baseline to radiographic progression or death (approximately 1 year)|PSA progression (Substudy 3), PSA progression is defined as an increase in PSA (after Week 12) of ≥25% greater than the nadir and an absolute increase of at least 2 ng/mL above nadir., From baseline to PSA response evaluated according to the PCWG3 criteria (up to 12 weeks)|CA-125 response (Substudy 4), Proportion of participants achieving a \> 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pre-treatment sample confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days., From baseline to CA-125 response evaluated according to the GCIG criteria (up to 12 weeks)|Overall survival (OS) (Substudy 4), OS is defined as time from start of treatment until death., From baseline to death (approximately 1 year)
This Phase II, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dato-DXd as monotherapy (MONO) and in combination with anticancer agents (COMBO) in various advanced solid tumour types.

This study has a modular design, as such a master protocol with independent substudies enables simultaneous evaluation of the safety profile, recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and efficacy of Dato-DXd in multiple disease populations and treatment combinations. This study will evaluate various solid tumour types, including endometrial cancer (Substudy 1), gastric cancer (Substudy 2), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Substudy 3), ovarian cancer (Substudy 4), colorectal cancer (CRC) (Substudy 5), urothelial cancer (Substudy 6), and biliary tract cancer (Substudy 7) in the advanced or metastatic setting. Within each substudy, Dato-DXd will be evaluated as monotherapy (for all substudies except Substudy 2) and in combination with approved or novel anticancer agents that may be active in the tumour type being evaluated (for all substudies except Substudy 1 and Substudy 7).
