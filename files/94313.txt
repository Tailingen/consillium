A Clinical Study of KK2260 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is the first in human study of KK2260. In Part 1a, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined while evaluating the safety and tolerability of KK2260 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (any cancer type). In Part 1b and Part 2, at least three dosing regimens and two dosing regimens by cancer type, respectively, will be selected, and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of each regimen will be evaluated.
