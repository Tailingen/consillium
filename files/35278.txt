Apatinib Combined With EGFR-TKI for Advanced Slow-progressed EGFR-TKI Resistant NSCLC
Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progress slowly after Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors（EGFR-TKI）resistance will be treated with Apatinib and EGFR-TKI. The primary objective is the disease progression free survival of the patients.
NSCLC|Apatinib|EGFR-TKI
DRUG: Apatinib（Tab. 500mg/d） combined with EGFR-TKI（as previously）
PFS, the disease progression free survival of patients, 3 months
OS, overall survival, 8 months|ORR, objective response rates, 6 months
Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had treated with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors（EGFR-TKI） and progressed slowly because of resistance are underwent with apatinib mesylate and continuous EGFR-TKI. The primary objective is the disease progression free survival of the patients. The secondary goals are overall survival, duration of response, objective response rates, disease control rates, quality of life scores and drug safety. Currently such patients are treated with EGFR-TKI continuously, but 3 months later, the disease will be progressed rapidly. This study will bring a new treatment that are more effective, less toxic and more convenient for NSCLC-patients with EGFR-TKI resistance.
