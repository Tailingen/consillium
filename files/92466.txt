Safety and Efficacy of NK520 to Treat Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NK520 in the treatment of pediatric relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. NK520 will be administered by intravenous injection. The safety and efficacy of this treatment will be evaluated.
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: NK520
Dose-Limiting Toxicity, To evaluate the DLT during N520 treatment, From the first infusion of NK520 to 4 weeks after last infusion of NK520|Complete Response Rate (CRR), Effectiveness Metrics, from the date of first infusion of NK510 up to 104 weeks
Overall response rate (ORR), Effectiveness Metrics, from the date of first infusion of NK510 up to 104 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), Effectiveness Metrics, From the date of enrollment up to 104 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Effectiveness Metrics, From date of enrollment up to 104 weeks, or progression, or date of death, whichever came first.|Overall Survival (OS), Effectiveness Metrics, From date of enrollment up to 104 weeks, or date of death, whichever came first.
This open label, single-arm study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogenic NK cells in pediatric relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Allogenic NK cells will be infused once a week. After infusion, the investigators will observe the characteristics of dose limited toxicity (DLT), and determine the maximum tolerable dose(MTD). To provide basis for the dosage and treatment plan of cell products in follow-up clinical trials.
