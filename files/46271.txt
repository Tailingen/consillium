Risk Factors of Hepatocellular Carcinomas Developed on Non-fibrotic Liver: Case-control Study (NoFlic Study)
The main objective of this study is to identify direct carcinogenic factors in the absence of cirrhosis, and the carcinogenesis pathways involved on nonfibrotic liver (NfCHC).

Most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicates cirrhosis, which is often caused by infection with hepatitis B or C viruses, alcohol, obesity, exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) or hemochromatosis. Nevertheless, 10 to 40% of HCCs can develop on non-cirrhotic terrain and about 5% on nonfibrotic liver (NfHCC). In 20 to 40% of these NfHCCs, no classical HCC risk factor is identified. Some cases could be the result of a transformation of an adenoma. Others may be associated with yet non-formally identified toxins and / or a specific genetic predisposition. While there is a lot of data on alterations of signaling pathways (ß-catenin, AKT / mTOR, Ras / pERK, etc.) in "classical" HCCs, altered pathways remain unknown in most NfHCCs, even in some cases, activation of β-catenin, inactivating mutations of HNF1 or activators of gp130 have been shown. A specific study of NfHCCs, rather rare cancers, represents an opportunity to look for directly carcinogenic factors in the absence of cirrhosis, and to dissect the involved carcinogenesis pathways.
