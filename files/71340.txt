Gastric Cancer
DRUG: T900607
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with previously treated gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma treated with T900607. (Gastric carcinoma closed to accrual as of 02/04.)
* Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
