Observational SIR-Spheres Study for the Treatment of Unresectable Liver Tumors (SIRtain Registry)
This registry seeks to prospectively gather a large repository of comprehensive observational data reflecting routine use of SIR-Spheres in patients diagnosed with unresectable HCC or unresectable liver metastases from mCRC refractory to or intolerant to chemotherapy, in order to assess clinical response in a real-world setting and further validate the safe and appropriate use of SIR-Spheres

DEVICE: SIRT
Progression-free survival (PFS), 24months from LPI|Liver PFS (LPFS), 24months from LPI|Overall survival (OS), 24months from LPI|Objective response rate (ORR) and liver response rate (LRR), 24months from LPI|Duration of response (DoR), 24months from LPI|Change scores from baseline to follow-up timepoints of the EQ-5D-5L, The (EurolQol) EQ-5D-5L is comprised of five questions on mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status with 5 level answers, 5 being extreme and 1 minimum., 24months from LPI|Change scores from baseline to follow-up timepoints of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), The 30 EORTC QLQ-C30 items constitute consist of 9 domains: physical function, role function, cognitive function, emotional function, social function, fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, and global health status. Items are answered on a scale of 1 to 4 or 1 to 7., 24months from LPI|Change scores from baseline to follow-up timepoints of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Hepatocellular Carcinoma module (EORTC QLQ-HCC18), The EORTC QLQ-HCC18 instrument consists of 6 symptom scales and 2 single items: that measures fatigue, body image, jaundice, nutrition, pain, fever, sexual interest and abdominal swelling. Scores are based on a 4-point Likert scale (with 1 = 'not at all' to 4 = 'very much')., 24months from LPI

This is a global, multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study (registry) to assess real-world outcomes in patients with unresectable HCC or unresectable liver metastases from mCRC refractory to or intolerant to chemotherapy who have been prescribed SIRT with SIR-Spheres per medical decision.

The study will be conducted through the involvement of approximately 845 patients from up to 44 sites in an estimated 10 countries.
