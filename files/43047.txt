A Phase 1 Trial of CD33xCD3 BsAb in Pediatric Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Pediatric patients (\<21 years at study entry) with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be treated with CD33\*CD3 a bispecific antibody to investigate the safety and tolerability of the drug.
AML, Childhood
DRUG: CD33*CD3 BsAb
Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Occurrence of DLTs during a DLT period ., 28 days|Occurrence of Adverse Events, Occurrence of Adverse Events during the trial, 52 weeks
This is an open label, first in human dose escalation trial in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of CD33xCD3 BsAb administered subcutaneously.

A modified Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (mBOIN) design will be applied. The trial will start with accelerated titration using single patient cohorts until one grade â‰¥2 AE not clearly associated to underlying disease, thereafter the trial will continue with mBOIN titration.
