Study of Neoadjuvent Chemotherapy Followed by SBRT in Patients With Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to research the effects of delivering full-dose neoadjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy (folfirinox) followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in order to intensify local therapy and improve outcomes.

Local control rate among PDAC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by SBRT, 1 year after surgery date
Pathological tumor response grade, Surgery Date (4 weeks [+/- 14 days] from end of SBRT)|Rate of margin negative resection, Surgery Date (4 weeks [+/- 14 days] from end of SBRT)|Rate of progression free survival, From surgery date to first documented date of progression, up to 5 years|Overall survival, From surgery date to date of death, up to 5 years|Local control rate, from date of surgery until date of first documented local failure, up to 5 years|Time to development of distant metastases, From surgery date to date of first documented metastatic disease, up to 5 years|Site of first failure, From surgery date to date of first documented metastatic disease, up to 5 years|Rate of grade 3-4 non hematological toxicity rates, Date of first fraction of SBRT through 30 days (+/-14) after surgery date
Primary Objectives:

1. To assess one-year local control rates in patients with operable PDAC who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and SBRT

Secondary Objectives:

1. To assess the following disease control endpoints: pathological response, disease-free survival, overall survival, failure pattern (local vs. distant) and time to development of distant metastases
2. To assess safety of the SBRT regimen

Exploratory objectives

1. To obtain exploratory data correlating tumor response grade with changes in circulating tumor DNA levels following chemotherapy, SBRT, and surgery in patients with PDAC
2. To obtain exploratory data correlating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) changes with disease control endpoints (overall survival, disease-free survival, failure pattern, and time to development of distant metastases)
3. To obtain exploratory data on positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and correlations with tumor response among patients treated on study.
