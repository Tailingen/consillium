Compare Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Docetaxel/Capecitabine/Oxliplatin Versus Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer at Stage IIIb and IV(KCSG ST15-08): TRIUMPH
multicenter, open label, randomaized, phase III

The role of post surgery adjuvant chemotherapy is becoming more and more important in AGC (advance gastric cancer). S-1 and combined therapy of Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin are currently accepted as a standard therapy among the AGC patients who were performed gastrectomy from the D2 surgery. However, many improvements will be needed in stage IIIB and IV. Combined chemotherapy of Docetaxel, Capecitabine, and Oxaliplatin may be considered as one of the best treatments for IIB and IV(M0) stage AGC patients who were performed gastrectomy.
Gastric Cancer, Adjuvant Chemotherapy, XO
DRUG: Docetaxel and capecitabine and oxaliplatin|DRUG: capecitabine and oxaliplatin
disease-free survival, To compare 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) between the two groups. DFS is defined as the time from randomization date to objective tumor recurrence as assessed with the RECIST 1.1, onset of new gastric cancer, or death., 3 years
overall survival, Overall survival (OS): Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization date to date of death by any cause. If death cannot be confirmed, survival time will be the last date when the subject's survival is confirmed or the date when the contact is lost, whichever comes first. For subjects lost to follow-up, the last contact date will be entered., 6 years|safety profile, Safety evaluation: Type and severity of adverse events will be compared between the two groups., 6 years
