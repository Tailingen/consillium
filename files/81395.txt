To estimate the ctDNA clearance rate of colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

To estimate the ctDNA clearance rate of colorectal cancer participants with minimal residual disease after 3 months of optimal lifestyle interventions

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the dynamics of ctDNA allele fractions after 3 months of optimal lifestyle interventions and every 3 months thereafter up to 12 months
* To estimate the recurrence rate at 1 year in subjects who complete 3 months of optimal lifestyle interventions
