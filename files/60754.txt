Surgery Versus Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Single Brain Metastases
Usually the treatment of a single brain metastasis is surgery or Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS). Surgery involves resection of the brain tumor by means of an operation, whereas SRS is treatment consisting of highly focused radiation doses to the tumor. These two treatment modalities are both widely used, well established, and proven to improve survival, but so far, no study has been done to directly compare the efficacy of one over the other. Neither treatment in itself is considered to be experimental and both have been shown to provide benefits to patients with metastatic brain tumors. The aim of this study is to determine which two modalities are better for local control and improving quality of life.

Patients who consent to this study will be randomized to either receive surgery or Radiosurgery in the treatment of single brain metastases. The study seeks to recruit 12 patient to each group. Patients will be in this study for up to five years from the time of the treatment finished. This will include follow-up visits at 4 weeks after the procedure and then every 3 months after the procedure up to 5 years.
