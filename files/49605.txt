Tislelizumab Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy as First-line Treatment for Stage IIIC2 Cervical Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in first-line treatment of stage IIIC2 cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: tislelizumab|OTHER: concurrent chemoradiotherapy
3-year progress free survival rate, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between entry into the study and progression of the tumor (in any respect) or death (from any cause)., up to 3 years|side effect rate, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, up to 3 years
Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR, assessed by RECIST v1.1 per independent central radiologic review., 3 months, after chemoradiotherapy|3-year overall survival rate, overall survival rate（OS）is calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of death or the last follow-up visit., up to 3 years
This is a multicenter, prospective, and randomized phase II clinical trial. Patients assigned to experimental group will receive standard radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin 40mg/m2 once every week for 5 weeks, combined with tislelizumab (200 mg, day 1) once every 3 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs or one year. Patients assigned to control group will undergo standard radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin 40mg/m2 once every week for 5 weeks. Compare the efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens in patients with stage IIIC2 cervical cancer.
