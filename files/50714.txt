PM14 Administered Intravenously to Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Despite recent advances in the treatment of solid tumors in general, advanced (metastatic) disease remains mostly incurable and there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic options for these patients, particularly investigational drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The investigation of new combination regimens of non-crossresistant agents with acceptable-and not completely overlapping-toxicities has been a major way to improve response rate and outcome of patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: PM14
Patients with dose limiting toxicities, To identify the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and to determine the maximun tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM14 administered i.v. on two days (Day 1 and Day 8) or on Day 1 only, both every three weeks (q3wk) over three hours to patients with advanced solid tumors., At cycle 2 (21-days cycle)|Overall response rate, To confirm the recommended dose (RD) determined during the Dose escalation phase, and to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM14 in terms of overall response rate (ORR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, and/or serum markers as appropriate, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors., At cycle 2 (21-days cycle)|Overall response rate, To confirm the recommended dose (RD) determined during the Dose escalation phase, and to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM14 in terms of overall response rate (ORR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, and/or serum markers as appropriate, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors., At cycle 4 (21-days cycle)|Overall response rate, To confirm the recommended dose (RD) determined during the Dose escalation phase, and to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM14 in terms of overall response rate (ORR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, and/or serum markers as appropriate, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors., At cycle 6 (21-days cycle)|Overall response rate, To confirm the recommended dose (RD) determined during the Dose escalation phase, and to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM14 in terms of overall response rate (ORR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1, and/or serum markers as appropriate, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors., Through study completion up to Cycle 9
Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate in each tumor type is defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed response (either complete response or partial response) according to the RECIST v.1.1 and/or by serum markers or with stable disease (SD) â‰¥4 months, Through study completion up to Cycle 9|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of study treatment to the date of documented progression or death (due to any cause). If progression or death has not occurred at the time of the analysis, the PFS will be censored on the date of last tumor evaluation., From the date of first infusion of study treatment to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 72 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time between the date of first documentation of response to the date of documented progression or death., From the date of the first documentation of response to the date of first PD or further therapy or death, assessed up to 72 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Patients will be evaluable for safety if they have received at least one partial infusion of PM14. Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.4. Additionally, treatment related discontinuations and treatment compliance (dose reduction, skipped doses and/or treatment delays due to AEs) will be described., From the date of first infusion of study treatment to the date of study termination, assessed up to 72 months|Pharmacokinetic: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic analyses will be evaluated in plasma and urine by standard noncompartmental analysis. Compartmental modeling may be performed if appropriate., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic: Area Under The Concentration-time Curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetic analyses will be evaluated in plasma and urine by standard noncompartmental analysis. Compartmental modeling may be performed if appropriate., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenetic, To evaluate Pharmacogenetic (PGt) in germline DNA by the presence or absence of PGt polymorphisms in genes relevant for PM14 disposition, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomic: Number of patients with RNA/protein expression, To conduct an exploratory Pharmacogenomic analysis in tumor tissue samples and ctDNA of patients treated with PM14. Quantitation of mRNA expression of selected genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms or related to the mechanism of action of PM14 by qRT-PCR. Quantitation of protein expression of these genes by IHC, in tumor tissue samples., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomic: Number of patients with Polymorphisms, To conduct an exploratory Pharmacogenomic analysis in tumor tissue samples and ctDNA of patients treated with PM14.

Evaluate the presence or absence of polymorphisms in genes relevant for PM14 disposition, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomic: Number of patients with Mutations, To conduct an exploratory Pharmacogenomic analysis in tumor tissue samples and ctDNA of patients treated with PM14. The mutational status of genes wil also be analyzed, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
First-in-human, open-label, dose-finding, phase I trial, using a classical 3+3 design followed by a continual reassessment method (CRM).

Patients will be included in cohorts of a minimum of three or six patients to receive PM14 at successively increasing dose levels, starting at 0.25 mg/m\^2 for the Days 1 and 8 schedule. For the Day 1 schedule, the starting dose will be 4.5 mg/m\^2. Dose escalation will proceed only after all the patients fully evaluable for DLT included at one dose level have completed the first cycle (i.e., three weeks). Once the RD has been determined, expansion cohorts will be included to have a minimum of 20 fully evaluable patients per indication (tumor type) treated in the Expansion phase (regardless of the schedule administered), and thus have an adequate number of patients to assess safety. The indications of these patients will be chosen depending on the efficacy data obtained during dose escalation. Patients treated at the expansion cohorts will be evaluable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1) and/or by serum markers only in patients with prostate cancer (prostate specific-antigen \[PSA\]) or ovarian cancer (carbohydrate antigen-125 \[CA-125\]) according to the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group Recommendations (PSAWGR) and the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) specific criteria, respectively.
