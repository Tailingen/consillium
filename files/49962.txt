Validation Study on the Removal of EpCAM-positive Tumour Cells From Blood Collected During Tumour Surgery Using Catumaxomab/Catuvab Device
The REMOVE study was an open-label, multicenter validation study on the removal of EpCAM-positive tumor cells from blood collected during tumor surgery using the CATUVAB Kit. The aim of the REMOVE clinical study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the application of the new medical device CATUVAB to allow retransfusion of autologous erythrocyte product produced by an intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) device during oncological high blood loss surgery. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that CATUVAB device utilized during autologous blood salvage procedures (including LDFs) depletes intraoperative blood of EpCAM-positive tumor cells.

depletion of EpCAM-positive tumor cells, Tumor cell count (Depletion) measured with Immun-histo chemistry staining and tumor cell counting in a Neubauer Chamber

* a depletion to ≤10 cells per 100 mL EC, OR
* if \<100.000 tumor cells have been detected before in IBS: a depletion by at least a factor of 103 in the EC (total) as compared to collected intraoperative blood (total), OR
* if ≥100.000 tumor cells have been detected before in IBS: a depletion by at least a factor of 5x103 in the EC (total) as compared to collected intraoperative blood (total), in at least 95% of subjects after one IBS/LDF cycle using the Catuvab device. The primary endpoint will only be determined in subjects with EpCAM-positive tumor cells in salvaged blood and who receive retransfusion of the EC, during surgery only
