A Study of MT-303 in Adults With Advanced or Metastatic GPC3-Expressing Cancers, Including HCC
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and define the RP2D of MT-303 in participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma expressing GPC3.

MT-303 will be administered intravenously with treatment provided until lack of tolerability or progression. Participants will be enrolled in sequential dose escalation cohorts with determination of dose limiting toxicities with the goal of establishing the (maximum tolerated dose) MTD and (Recommended Phase 2 dose) RP2D.
