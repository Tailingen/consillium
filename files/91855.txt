Local Control With Reduced-dose Radiotherapy for High-Risk Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to give 12T a smaller dose of radiation in order to decrease these late side effects.

RADIATION: External beam radiotherapy|RADIATION: proton beam RT
assess local control rates treatment response, will be assessed via imaging (CT+/- MRI and MIBG) and clinical evidence at the primary site post completion of treatment. The baseline scan will be the pre-irradiation CT scan. Local failure is defined as a relapse in the primary tumor bed or adjacent lymph nodes., 3 yeas
event-free survival, will be performed for each patient using clinical data and imaging. Events are defined as failure (loco-regional and/or distant), treatment-related malignancy, or death., 3 years|Assessment of toxicity, will occur at the pre-specified follow-up time-points using the CTCAE version 4.0 grading system., 3 years
