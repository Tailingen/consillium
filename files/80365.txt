A Phase 1 Protocol of 5-Azacytidine and Erlotinib in Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To document the toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities, of this regimen of 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine any potential anti-tumor effects, as determined by the objective tumor response (complete and partial responses), clinical benefit (complete and partial responses, and clinical benefit), the time to tumor response, the time to tumor progression, and the overall survival.
Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
DRUG: 5-azacytidine, erlotinib|DRUG: Erlotinib PO and Vidaza IV
Quality and quantity of adverse events due to administration of erlotinib + 5-azacytidine, as therapy for the treatment of advanced or metastatic cancer., 4 years
OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15, days 1-2 and 15-16, days 1-3 and 15-17, or days 1-4 and 15-18. Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days and then every 3 months for 5 years.
