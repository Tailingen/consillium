Characterization of Biliary Cell-derived Organoids from Bile of PSC and Non-PSC Patients
The purpose of this research is to create a collection of bile, bile duct brushings and medical information from people with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and controls to learn more about changes that occur in the liver.

Number of participants in study., Number of participants in study., 20 years
Number of samples (per type), Number of samples collected (bile liquid, biliary cells), 20 years|Number of clinical phenotypes and/or observations., Number of clinical phenotypes and/or endpoints observed (i.e. disease progression, liver ca development, organoids.), 20 years
The study will ask participants to provide bile and/or bile duct cytology brushings at time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). The bile and brushings will be used to generate and perpetuate bile-derived organoids using an established matrigel-based protocol. These organoids will then be used in downstream experiments to better understand disease-specific alterations to biological pathways informative of disease pathogenesis
