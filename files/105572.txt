Recombinant Versus Highly Purified FSH in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
Control ovarian stimulation responses, pregnancy and miscarriage rates are indifferent when either recombinant or highly purified follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is used.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Gonal-F, Fostimon|DRUG: Gonal-F, Fostimon
Ovarian Response, 0-15 days post gonadotropin administration
Pregnancy rate, 12-15 days post embryo replacement
Patients will be randomized using sealed and numbered envelopes and will be assigned to receive a similar ovarian stimulation regime incorporating either Gonal-F or highly purified Fostimon as the hormonal analog. Ovarian response using either of the two compounds, pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates will be compared to define possible statistical significance.
