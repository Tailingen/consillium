According to pathological efficacy assessment criteria, A decrease in tumor stage from cT2 (Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer - MIBC) to non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), including stages pT0, pTis, pTa, and pT1, indicates a treatment-sensitive tumor and is considered a good pathologic response. Conversely, if the tumor stage remains the same or increases, it is considered a poor pathologic response., Within 1 month after obtaining the surgical pathology report and imaging report results
Overall Survival (OS), the duration from the time a patient receives systemic therapy to the time of death from any cause., 1 years to 3 years after receiving treatment|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS), the duration from the start of treatment to the occurrence of imaging progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first). Conventional imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria), and FAPI PET/MRI (PERCIST 1.0 criteria) were used to assess the imaging progression of patients after receiving treatment, respectively., 1 years to 3 years after receiving treatment|Overall Remission Rate (Objective Response Rate, ORR), usually includes patient cases with CR+PR. Among them, conventional imaging was used to assess the proportion of patients meeting the criteria for CR or PR using the RECIST 1.1 criteria; FAPI PET/MRI was used to assess the proportion of patients meeting the criteria for CR or PR using the PERCIST 1.0 criteria;, Within 1 month after obtaining the surgical pathology report and imaging report results|Disease Control Rate (DCR), usually includes the proportion of patients with CR+PR+SD.

The MIBC diagnostic study was a prospective trial. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with suspected MIBC were enrolled and underwent FAPI PET/MRI, FDG PET/MRI and MRI examination, and the imaging data and clinical laboratory and pathologic data were collected, and the postoperative pathological results were used as the gold standard to compare the accuracy of FAPI PET/MRI, FDG PET/MRI and MRI in diagnosing MIBC.

The MIBC neoadjuvant therapy efficacy assessment study was a prospective trial. Patients with MIBC were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the regimen was selected individually according to the patient's condition, and the indicators were followed up until the end of time or the occurrence of an endpoint event to obtain information on survival time. FAPI PET/MRI, FDG PET/MRI and MRI were performed once before the start of neoadjuvant therapy and once after the end of therapy, and after the end of neoadjuvant therapy, patients received transurethral cystectomy of bladder tumors or radical cystectomy according to the efficacy and condition, and the combination of the imaging data and the clinical laboratory and pathological data were used to compare FAPI PET/MRI, FDG PET/ MRI and MRI in the assessment of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in MIBC patients to guide clinical treatment options.
