Quality of Life and Survival of Patients With Colorectal Cancer 5 Years After Surgery - Follow-up of the RCT DIQOL
This observational follow-up study of the randomized trial (RCT) DIQOL investigates long-term effects of an intervention with quality of life (QoL) diagnosis and therapy on present QoL, survival, and recurrence-free survival of colorectal cancer survivors more than 5 years after surgery.

Moreover, patients' experiences with aftercare for colorectal cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic and their recollections of their illness and therapy are examined.

In a complex intervention a clinical pathway with quality of life (QoL) diagnosis and tailored therapy had been developed for patients with colorectal cancer and its effectiveness was evaluated in a randomized trial (RCT DIQOL, NCT02321813, Klinkhammer-Schalke et al, 2020). In the RCT DIQOL a total of 220 patients were randomised (1:1) into two groups: a care pathway, including QoL-profiles consisting of 13 QoL scales plus specific therapeutic recommendations forwarded to the patient's doctor (intervention) or standard postoperative care (control). QoL was measured (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29) in all patients after surgery and during aftercare (3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively). A need for QoL therapy was defined as a score \<50 points on at least one QoL scale. It was demonstrated that the proportion of patients with a need for QoL therapy was significantly lower in intervention group patients at 12 months after surgery (primary endpoint).

Until now, it is unclear whether there are also long-term benefits of QoL diagnosis and therapy. Therefore, the aim of this observational, cross-sectional follow-up study of the RCT DIQOL is to investigate long-term effects of the intervention on present QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29), overall survival, and recurrence-free survival more than 5 years after surgery by comparing former intervention and control group patients. Moreover, participants will be asked for their experiences during aftercare in relation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for their recollection of their illness and therapy. Data are collected via questionnaire.
