Minnelide Along With Abraxane Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
A Phase 1b, Open-Label, Safety, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Study of an Anti-super-enhancer Minnelide Once a Day on Days 1 to 5, Days 8 to 12 and Days 15 to 19 Along with Abraxane Plus Gemcitabine in Patients with Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Minnelide
To determine the safety of Minnelide capsules when given in combination with SOC, To observe any increase in the number of patients that experience Grade 4 neutropenia lasting â‰¥ 5 days or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (or Grade 3 with bleeding); Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related non-hematological toxicity (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that last \> 72 hours despite maximal treatment when Minnelide is given in combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared to the incidence with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel., 24 months
pharmacokinetics of Minnelide and to determine the pharmacodynamics of GRP78, To determine the pharmacokinetics of Minnelide when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel

Plasma concentration data will be used to determine the following PK parameters:

* AUC Area under the concentration curve
* Cmax Maximum plasma concentration
* Tmax Time to maximum plasma concentration
* t1/2 Terminal phase half life
* CL/F Total body clearance
* Vd/F Apparent volume of distribution
* To determine the effects of Minnelide on the pharmacodynamics of GRP78, 24 months
Stressing the patient's pancreatic cancer by giving the anti-super-enhancer Minnelide to increase endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and improve the progression-free survival (PFS) when patients are treated with standard of care (SOC) nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel (Abraxane) plus gemcitabine.
