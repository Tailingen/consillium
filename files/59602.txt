Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients With Melanoma and Liver Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of treatment with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) administered via hepatic arterial infusion in patients with liver metastases (including but not restricted to) of malignant melanoma.
