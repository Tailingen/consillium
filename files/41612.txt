Efficacy and Safety Profiles of SR-T100 Gel on External Genital Warts/Condyloma Acuminate(EGWs)
To evaluate the efficacy of SR-T100 gel by observing total clearance rate of treated baseline EGW(s) on the treated area.
Condyloma Acuminata|Genital Warts|Condylomata Acuminata|Venereal Warts
DRUG: Vehicle gel|DRUG: SR-T100 gel with 1.0 % SM|DRUG: SR-T100 gel with 2.3% SM
Total clearance rate of baseline lesion(s), 16 weeks
Total clearance rate of all lesion(s), 16 weeks|Period duration of achieving total clearance of baseline lesion(s) and new lesion(s), 16 weeks|Partial clearance rate, 16 weeks|New lesion(s) occurrence rate, 16 weeks|Recurrence rate in the 12-week follow-up time, 28 weeks|Recurrence time period, 28 weeks|Safety: evaluate the changes occurring from baseline to EOT visit, including PE, vital sign, lab. test, local skin reaction, and adverse event, etc., 28 weeks
A double-blind, randomized,vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, and dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SR-T100 gel in patients with EGW(s). The primary efficacy endpoint will be defined as the proportion of patients whose baseline EGW(s) on the treated area achieve total clearance. The efficacy of SR-T100 gel in prevention of new EGW(s) occurrence will be evaluated. Distinct to existing medications for EGWs, SR-T100 gel possesses characteristics of high safety and low LSR causality. SR-T100 gel will be administered on EGW lesion(s) for clearance and on the surrounding clinical normal skin for prevention of new EGW(s) occurrence.
