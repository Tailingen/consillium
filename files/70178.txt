A Phase 2, Open-Label Study of ABSK-011 Combined Atezolizumab in HCC Patients
This study is an open phase II clinical study, which consists of part a and Part B. Part a will evaluate the safety and tolerability of absk-011 combined with atilizumab in patients with advanced or unresectable HCC to And pk/pd characteristics, and determine the treatment plan of Part B. Part B will evaluate absk-011 combined with atilizumab Anti Fgf19 overexpression in advanced stage or non resectable patients who have not received systemic therapy or only received first-line systemic therapy before In addition to the safety and tolerability of HCC subjects, the antitumor activity of the combination will be further evaluated.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ABSK-011 180 mg QD combined with atilizumab 1200 mg q3w
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABSK-011 combined with atezolizumab mab in subjects with advanced or unresectable HCC, Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycleï¼›Incidence and grade of AE, SAE and AESI by CTCAE v5.0, 10 month|To evaluate the objective response rate of ABSK-011 combined with atezolizumab in subjects with advanced FGF19 overexpression or unresectable HCC, Objective response rate (ORR): complete response and partial response determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 and to be confirmed, 10month
During part a, all subjects will receive continuous oral administration of absk-011 once a day (QD) or twice a day (bid) with an initial dose of 180 mg, and intravenous infusion (IV) of 1200 mg of atilizumab every 21 days (q3w). After the first subject (sentinel subject) in each dose cohort completed the first combined medication, follow-up subjects were administered at least 7 days later.

Part B will include subjects with advanced unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic therapy or only received first-line systemic therapy and whose Fgf19 expression is positive. No more than 70% of the enrolled subjects have only received first-line systemic therapy
