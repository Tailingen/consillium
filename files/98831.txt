Adoptive Cell Therapy Plus Chemotherapy and Radiation After Surgery in Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) for colorectal cancer (CRC).

BIOLOGICAL: DC-CIK|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progress-free survival, 3 years
Overall survival, 3 years|Quality of life (QOL), 3 Years|Phenotypic analysis of T cells, The number of CD3+ (or CD8+ or CD4+ or CD56+) T cell, 1 year
60 patients with stageⅠ\~ Ⅲ CRC, who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) or group B (just receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of autologous tumor lysate pulsed DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks) and 4 cycles chemo-radiotherapy. Patients in group B will receive only 4 cycles chemo-radiotherapy.
