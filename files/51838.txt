Airwave Compression Therapy to Prevent Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
This study aims to explore the effectiveness of early intervention of airwave compression therapy to prevent the occurrence of postoperative breast cancer-related lymphedema(BCRL).
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: airwave compression therapy|OTHER: standard care: health education and routine functional exercise
Incidence of lymphedema, Incidence of lymphedema of ipsilateral upper limb, 18 months
Symptoms, Questionnaire. The level of subjective symptoms( pain, heaviness, paresthesia) at each time point was recorded with a 0-3 four-point scale questionnaire. 0-3 indicated no symptoms, mild, moderate, and severe, respectively., 18 months|Quality of life assessment, FACT-B (V4.0), 18 months
This study aims to explore the effectiveness of early intervention of airwave compression therapy to prevent the occurrence of postoperative breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), hereby improving the quality of life of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate the predictive values of patient plasma cytokines to the occurrence and development of BCRL.
