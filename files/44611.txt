Natural Killer Cells Infusion for Treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With Minimal Residual Disease
This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of haploid donor-derived in vitro activated natural killer(NK) cells infusion for Treating acute myeloid leukemia Patients With minimal residual disease.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: haploid allogeneic NK cell therapy
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), MRD-negative is defined as \<0.1% blasts with leukemia-associated phenotype detected by flow cytometry. MRD-positive is defined as \>=0.1% blasts with leukemia-associated phenotype detected by flow cytometry., 12 months
Number of participants with adverse events, Evaluation of toxicities defined as any CTCAE (v. 4.03), 12 months
Patients of acute myeloid leukemia after chemotherapy with MRD(minimal residual disease) will receive NK cell infusion combined with consolidation chemotherapy. The bone marrow morphology and MRD remission of the patients will be observed 15 days after the same treatment. All patients will be followed up for 1 year.

NK cells are prepared in Beijing iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd, which is subsidiary to Shanghai iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd.
