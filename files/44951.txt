Tebentafusp in HLA-A*0201 Positive Previously Untreated Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
This is a phase II open-label, single-arm, multi-center study of tebentafusp in HLA- A\*0201 positive previously untreated (1L) untreated metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with an integrated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) biomarker.
Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: Tebentafusp
Change in ctDNA response, ctDNA response (defined as ≥0.3 log reduction) in ctDNA-evaluable patients as measured using Signatera assay., At Baseline, at Week 10 of each 12-week cycle, Up to 24 months]
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR as assessed imRECIST. Percentage of patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to the treatment. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or nontarget) with reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), Median length of time from start of treatment that patients remain alive., Up to 5 years|1-year Overall Survival (OS), The percentage of patients alive at one year after start of treatment., At one year (post start of treatment)|2-year Overall Survival (OS), The percentage of patients alive at two years after start of treatment., At two years (post start of treatment)|3-year Overall Survival (OS), The percentage of patients alive at three years after start of treatment., At three years (post start of treatment)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Median number of months from start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Per RECISIT v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD):≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., Up to 5 years|6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS), Percentage of patients without disease progression or death from any cause at six months after start of treatment. Per RECISIT v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD):≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., At 6 months (post start of treatment)|1-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Percentage of patients without disease progression or death from any cause at one year after start of treatment. Per RECISIT v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD):≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., At one year (post start of treatment)|2-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Percentage of patients without disease progression or death from any cause at two years after start of treatment. Per RECISIT v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD):≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., At two years (post start of treatment)
Uveal Melanoma (UM) is a rare type of melanoma (3.1% of all melanoma incidence, approximately 4000 cases globally per year) with an incidence of 5.3-10.9 cases per million individuals. Despite its rare incidence rate, UM is the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy of the adult eye that affects the vascular layers of the eye (iris, ciliary body, and choroid). UM has a high incidence of metastases, predominantly to the liver, because of the lack of significant lymphatic traffic out of the eye and predominant hematogenous spread.

Tebentafusp has been studied in four clinical studies including IMCgp100-01 (NCT01211262; ≥2L cutaneous and uveal melanoma), IMCgp100-102 (NCT02570308; ≥2L uveal melanoma), IMCgp100-201 (NCT02535078; PD-1 naïve and PD-1 R/R cutaneous melanoma), and IMCgp100-202 (NCT03070392; 1L uveal melanoma vs. physicians' choice chemotherapy). Based on early first-in-human (FIH) studies, tebentafusp 68 mcg was identified as the RP2D; with an intra- patient escalation regimen (20 mcg at C1D1 and 30 mcg at C1D8) and the dose escalated at C1D15. This dose was subsequently evaluated in a recently completed phase -II trial - IMC-p100-202 - that randomized 378 treatment-naïve, HLA-A\*0201 positive patients with advanced uveal melanoma on a 2-to-1 ratio to tebentafusp (n = 252) or investigator's choice (IC) of dacarbazine, ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab (n = 126). Based on the data from the IMCgp100-202 study, the current approved dose of tebentafusp is a fixed starting dose of 20mcg (C1D1), followed by 30 mcg (C1D8) and 68mcg at C1D15 and beyond.
