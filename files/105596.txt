Study of Panobinostat in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Japanese Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Relapse/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: LBH589 (panobinostat)|DRUG: bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone
Percentage of Participants With Near Complete Response (nCR)/ Complete Response (CR) Rate, nCR plus CR rate after 8 cycles of therapy as defined by the modified European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria per investigator assessment as the proportion of participants with nCR or CR as their best overall response., after 24 weeks (8 cycles; cycle = 21 days)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from first dose of study treatment to progression or death due to any cause, based on modified European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria per Investigator's assessment, duration of study up to approx. 4 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with CR, nCR or partial response (PR) based on modified EBMT criteria per investigator assessment, 24 weeks (8 cycles; cycle = 21 days)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first dose of study treatment to death, up to 30 days after end of study, approx. 4 years|Minimal Response Rate (MRR) Per Investigator, MRR is based on modified EBMT criteria per investigator assessment, after 24 weeks (8 cycles; cycle = 21 days)|Time to Response (TTR) Per Investigator, TTR is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to first documented response (PR or nCR or CR) per modified EBMT criteria as assessed by investigator, duration of study up to approx. 4 years|Time to Progression/Relapse (TTP) Per Investigator, TTP is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or relapse, duration of study up to approx. 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Investigator, DOR is defined as the time from date of the first documented CR/nCR or PR to the date of the first documented progression or relapse or death due to MM, duration of study up to approx. 4 years|Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured by FACT/GOG-Ntx Total Score, QoL as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecology Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-NTX) scale calculated scores and changes from baseline were summarized by visit. The FACT/GOG-Ntx is a measure to assess neurotoxicity from systemic chemotherapy. The recall period for this measure is the past 7 days. FACT/GOG-Ntx Total Score: 0 - 152 (28 + 28 + 24 + 28 + 44 = 152). (FACT-G Physical Well-Being Score: 0 - 28, FACT-G Social/Family Well-Being Score: 0 - 28, FACT-G Emotional Well-Being Score: 0 - 24, FACT-G Functional Well-Being Score: 0 - 28, FACT/GOG-Ntx Neurotoxicity Subscale Score: 0 - 44). 4. The scales are combined. The higher the score, the better the QOL., Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 156|Composite PharmacoKinetics (PK) of Panobinostat and Bortezomib: AUClast, AUC0-24h, AUC0-48h, AUCinf, PK sample collection was performed in subjects who agreed to blood samplings for the PK assessments of PAN and BTZ.
