Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy vs Placebo Plus Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy and Pembrolizumab vs Placebo as Adjuvant Therapy in Participants With Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (MK-3475-522/KEYNOTE-522)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and pembrolizumab vs placebo as adjuvant therapy in participants who have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will receive neoadjuvant study treatment (Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy OR Placebo + Chemotherapy) based on the randomization schedule for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each participant will then undergo definitive surgery 3-6 weeks after conclusion of the last cycle of the neoadjuvant study treatment. After definitive surgery, each participant will receive adjuvant study treatment (Pembrolizumab OR Placebo) for approximately 27 weeks (9 cycles). Following adjuvant study treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease recurrence.

The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is superior to placebo, in combination with chemotherapy, as measured by the rate of Pathological Complete Response (pCR) and/or Event-free Survival (EFS), in participants with locally advanced TNBC.

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 27-30 weeks|Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 8 years
pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0 ypN0 (i.e., no invasive or noninvasive residual in breast or nodes) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants and in participants with tumors expressing Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)., Up to approximately 27-30 weeks|pCR rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in participants with tumors expressing PD-L1., Up to approximately 27-30 weeks|EFS in participants with tumors expressing PD-L1, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 8 years|pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0/Tis (i.e., absence of invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants and in participants with tumors expressing PD-L1., Up to approximately 27-30 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to approximately 8 years|Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE., Up to approximately 61 weeks|Percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE., Up to approximately 57 weeks|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core 30 Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) score, The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Individual responses are given on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much), with a lower score indicating a better outcome.
