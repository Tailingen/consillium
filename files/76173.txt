Tumor Subtypes in Subjects on FOLFIRINOX With Non-Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a research study to evaluate how the genetic makeup of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can affect the response to FDA-approved chemotherapy treatment, FOLFIRINOX, given before surgery to remove the tumor. Certain types of PDAC tumors can be surgically resected (removed). However, not all types of PDACs are resectable, especially if they are close to important structures like blood vessels or intestines. These types of PDACs are treated with chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX. Research studies showed that chemotherapy after surgical resection of PDAC tumors reduced the risk of the cancer returning.

Chemotherapy is used to treat PDAC that has not spread outside of the pancreas and is not resectable. FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy treatment that combines multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and 5-FU. Patients receive these agents by intravenous infusion. Of these drugs, 5-FU requires you to return home with a chemotherapy pump that will deliver chemotherapy over 46 hours. This regimen has been studied in pancreatic cancer that has been removed with surgery as a method for preventing the cancer from returning. Studies showed FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy reduced the risk of cancer returning and increased patients survival. In this study, researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy given before surgery will make the cancer easier to remove with surgery and increase the chances of the cancer staying away after surgery.

Researchers have shown that pancreatic cancers are not all the same when you look at the DNA and RNA that is inside a pancreatic cancer cell.

Depending on the expression of different genes in a cancer cell, some pancreatic cancers may respond differently to chemotherapy. In this study researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy can change the genetic profile of the cancer. This will be studied by obtaining a biopsy of the cancer before the start of chemotherapy, and after 8 treatments of chemotherapy. They will also study cancer cells that will be collected from blood samples.

Best disease control rate by Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subtype, To evaluate the association between PDAC tumor subtype (particularly basal-like versus classical subtype) and best disease control rate (DCR) after administration of FOLFIRINOX in subjects with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer, DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with either Complete Response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as determined by RECIST 1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR as a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and SD as no response or less response than Partial or Progressive., 6 months after start of treatment
Rate of resectability, The number of patients who following treatment with FOLFIRINOX were subsequently deemed to have resectable disease and underwent surgical resection, 6 months after the start of treatment|Overall survival, median overall survival (OS) of all patients receiving FOLFIRINOX on study as well as in 1) resectable, 2) borderline resectable and 3) unresectable PDAC, measured from the start of treatment until death from any cause., 3 years|Progression free survival, Median time from start of treatment until death or progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, for all patients and with respect to each tumor and stroma subtype. Progressive Disease (PD), is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 3 years|best objective response rate (ORR; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), Estimation of the best ORR for all patients and with respect to each tumor and stroma subtype. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with either Complete Response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by RECIST 1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR as a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions;, 6 months from start of study treatment|rate of drug-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events, rate of drug-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events, assessed based upon patient reported toxicity as measured by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). The CTCAE is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE., 6 months from the start of treatment|R0 resection rate, The number of patients who underwent surgical resection and whose surgical specimens had a microscopically margin-negative resection (R0)., 6 months from start of treatment|proportion of patients whose tumor/stroma subtype changes after treatment with FOLFIRINOX, The proportion of patients whose tumor/stroma subtype changed from baseline after treatment with FOLFIRINOX. This will be calculated separately for tumor and stroma., 6 months from start of treatment
This is a single arm, phase II clinical trial designed to assess the impact of tumor and stromal molecular subtypes on the efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRNOX in untreated subjects with resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Subjects will undergo an EUS-guided core biopsy of the pancreas prior to treatment and after cycle 8 of FOLFIRINOX. Imaging will be performed after every 4 cycles of chemotherapy (8 weeks) and reassessed for resectability after 12 cycles. If patients show a response to treatment that is deemed by the surgical oncologist to be amenable to resection, surgery can be pursued after 8 cycles of therapy. In this case, the remaining 4 cycles of treatment will be given after surgery.

Duration of Therapy:

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until:

* Disease progression,
* Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
* Unacceptable adverse event(s),
* Subject decides to withdraw from the study, or
* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

Duration of Follow Up:

- Subjects will be followed for 36 months after removal from study treatment or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
