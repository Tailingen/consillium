Lenalidomide and Obinutuzumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide and obinutuzumab work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide and obinutuzumab may work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Recurrent Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Refractory Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab
Number of Participants With a Response, Response is Complete Response or Partial Response. CR is absence of Lymphadenopathy, Hepatomegaly or Splenomegaly, lymphocytes \< 4000/ul, normocellular, \<30% lymphocytes, no B-lymphoid nodules, Platelets \> 100,000/ul, hemoglobin \>11.0 g/dl and Neutrophils \>1500/ul.

PR is \>/= 50% decrease in lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and Blood Lymphocytes from baseline, 50% reduction in marrow infiltrate or B-lymphoid nodules. Platelet count \> 100,000/ul, Hemoglobin \> 11 g/dl and Neutrophils \>1500/ul or increase \>/= 50% of all over base., Up to 5 years
Time to Next Treatment, The time-to-event outcomes (such as time to next treatment or overall survival). Time to Next Treatment is from start of study medication to the start of the next treatment, or last follow up if no next therapy., Up to 5 years, 2 months|Overall Survival, Time from date of treatment start until date of death due to any cause or last Follow-up. Survival will be measured by the estimated median survival computed by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis, which is the time point at which the cumulative survival drops below 50%, if present. If not present then the median Overall Survival is not reached and not available (NA) as there are an insufficient number of participants with events. In either case ranges are provided for observed survival intervals used in the K-M analysis., Up to 5 years, 2 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Overall response defined as achievement of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Safety of the combination. II. Response according to prognostic markers at diagnosis. III. Time to next treatment. IV. Overall survival.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 3-4 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of courses 2-6 and lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 9-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue to receive lenalidomide PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
