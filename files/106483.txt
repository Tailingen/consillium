Patient Experience of Consent for Cancer Surgery in Light of Recent Changes to UK Law- a Questionnaire Study
Since the 2015 Montgomery vs Lanarkshire Health Board ruling, the consent process in the UK has had to change. In practice, this means that doctors must ask themselves whether the patient knows about the material risks of the treatment being proposed, alternatives to the treatment, and whether reasonable care has been taken to ensure the patient actually knows this. This study aims to determine patients' perspectives of consent for major cancer surgery in light of the Lanarkshire ruling.
