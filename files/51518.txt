The Effect of Pain Neuroscience Education and Behavioural Graded Activity on Chronic Pain in Breast Cancer Survivors
Chronic pain in breast cancer survivors (BCS) is of considerable concern as it impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and activities of daily living negatively. Over the past decades, awareness has raised the value of pain neuroscience education (PNE) in chronic pain. However, pain education remains underused in oncology and is often restricted to a biomedical management, which falls short in explaining persistent pain following cancer. Since PNE alone has rather small effect sizes, it should ideally be combined with a physical part, 'behavioural graded activity' (BGA). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of PNE with BGA compared to usual care on chronic pain in BCS.

A multi-centre, parallel, two-arm, double-blinded superiority with a three months intervention and two years follow-up will be conducted in 200 BCS with chronic pain. These will be randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. The intervention group will receive 6 sessions, in which PNE and BGA will be integrated. Whereas, the usual care group will receive an information leaflet regarding "Pain in and after cancer".

The primary objective of the present study is to examine whether the combination of PNE and BGA has an added value in decreasing the pain intensity compared to the usual care in BCS with chronic pain. The secondary objectives are to investigate whether the combination of PNE and BGA has the ability to reduce endogenous hyperalgesia and improve HRQoL compared to the usual care in BCS with chronic pain.
