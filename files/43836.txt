A Proof of Concept Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Patients With Chemo-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This single arm study evaluated the bone marrow response, safety, and tolerability of 6 months treatment with Avastin (bevacizumab) monotherapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients received 8 cycles (21 days duration) of Avastin monotherapy (15mg/kg) with 6 months of follow-up.
Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic
DRUG: Bevacizumab
Bone Marrow Response, Bone marrow response was defined as the change in percentage of infiltration at the interim staging (after 4 cycles of treatment) and the end of treatment., Baseline to the end of treatment (up to 24 weeks)
Best Overall Response (BOR), The percentage of participants in each BOR category (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD)) is reported. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target (TL) and non-target lesions (non-TL). PR was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD, or the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs. For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since treatment started. For non-TLs, SD was defined as the persistence of 1 or more lesions. PD was defined as ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started, the unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Baseline to the end of treatment (up to 24 weeks)
