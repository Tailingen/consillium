Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Injection of the Imaging Agent 111In-IPN01087 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic or Colorectal Cancer.
111Indium-labelled IPN01087 (111In-IPN01087) is developed as a radioactive diagnostic imaging agent in patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. It is used with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the identification of tumours that overexpress the neurotensin receptor-1 (NTSR1). The purpose of this study is to assess how well 111In-IPN01087 is tolerated and what the most suitable amount to be injected is to obtain good quality images. The study will also look at how 111In-IPN01087 is distributed throughout the body and what the optimal time for doing the scans will be after it has been given as a single intravenous injection.
