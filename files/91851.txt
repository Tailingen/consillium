Development and Application of a Thrombosis Risk Prediction Model in Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The purpose of this observational study is to explore the incidence, risk factors, and relationship with therapeutic outcomes of VTE (venous thromboembolism) and ATE (arterial thromboembolism) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy. The primary questions it aims to address are:

1. What is the real-world incidence of VTE/ATE in lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors?
2. What are the risk factors for VTE/ATE in lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors?
3. What is the impact of VTE/ATE on the prognosis of lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors?

Researchers will compare the characteristics and biomarkers of patients with and without ICI-associated VTE/ATE to identify novel specific biomarkers for thrombotic events. Furthermore, they will construct a risk assessment model for thrombotic events to provide guidance for precision prevention and treatment in clinical practice.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated venous thromboembolism/arterial thromboembolism, From the administration of the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors until three months after the completion of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or until the initiation of other anti-tumor therapies following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, symptomatic and incidentally detected arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism events that occur during this period are included., From the date of the administration of the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors until three months after the completion of therapy or the initiation of other anti-tumor therapies, whichever comes first, assessed up to 96 months.
Progression-free survival, Progression-Free Survival refers to the time from the start of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy until the disease progresses or the patient dies, whichever occurs first., From the date of the administration of the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors until the date of disease progression, death from any cause, or the cutoff date, whichever comes first, assessed up to 96 months.|Overall survival, Overall survival refers to the time from the start of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy until the patient dies or the cutoff date, whichever occurs first.", From the date of the administration of the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors until the date of death from any cause, or the cutoff date, whichever comes first, assessed up to 96 months.|Objective response rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) refers to the proportion of patients who experience a confirmed reduction in tumor size or complete disappearance of the tumor, as assessed by standard criteria such as RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). It includes both complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR) and is typically reported as a percentage of the total treated population., From the date of the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors until the best efficacy is achieved, assessed up to 96 months.
