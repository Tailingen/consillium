Physical Activity Experiment on Male Prostate Cancer Patients
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in France (56,841 cases in 2012). Although the benefits of physical activity (PA) in cancer patients are currently well established in the scientific literature, several studies have shown that this population is not sufficiently active. Strengthen patient adherence to prevention counseling by the physical activity (PA) is emerging as a new challenge for personalized treatment in oncology. In order to encourage the engagement and maintenance in a regular PA of cancer patients, first, their experiences of physical activity (PA) practice should be considered and their initial social representations of the practice considered. Secondarily, it is also important to identify health professionals who retain a key role in defining the framework, objectives and means of action to promote lifestyle changes towards a more active lifestyle. In addition, peer mentoring appears to offer promising perspectives for promoting adherence and long-term maintenance in physical activity (PA) of cancer patients.

The main objective of this project is to measure the adherence of prostate cancer patients to a physical activity program with a tracking of the motivation by a pair.
