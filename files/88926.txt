Intra-mucous colorectal neoplasia lesions (or even with minimal mucosal infiltration), formerly treated surgically, are increasingly treated endoscopically.

The IPC as a center for interventional endoscopy has been taking care of these lesions for several years.

Resection techniques have diversified since the 2000s (polypectomy, monobloc or piecemeal mucosectomy, submucosal dissection ... etc) and the endoscopy team has developed its various techniques within the institute ; Practice has evolved and has not been studied or evaluated in recent years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate practices and to compare results with the literature, and to identify predictive factors for the failure or success of endoscopic treatment of these early neoplastic lesions.
