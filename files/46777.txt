Combination Bisphosphonate and Anti-Angiogenesis Therapy With Pamidronate and Thalidomide
The purpose of this research is to study how helpful the combination of thalidomide and Pamidronate is in controlling multiple myeloma and to study any side effects that may be experienced.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pamidronate|DRUG: Thalidomide
To evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment with Thalidomide and Pamidronate in patients with refractory myeloma and poor hematopoietic stem cell reserve. Effectiveness will be based on the estimate of the objective response rate (CR + PR).
To compare the effect of these agents on disease parameters, specifically on time to disease progression and overall survival.
Recently, laboratory research found that thalidomide can inhibit the formation of new blood vessels that are necessary for the growth and spread of cancer. In order to grow and increase in size, tumors require new blood vessels to supply them with the necessary blood to grow. If we can prevent these new blood vessels feeding the tumor from being formed by using thalidomide we might slow or stop the growth of the tumor. This concept is called "anti-angiogenesis". It is hoped that thalidomide will slow or stop the growth myeloma. However, it cannot be guaranteed that you will benefit if you take part in this study. The treatment you receive may even be harmful.
