Advanced Solid Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Mogamulizumab (KW-0761)
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), A standard 3+3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD. Four dose levels of KW-0761 will be investigated (0.5mg/kg, 1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, 10mg/kg). Patients will be treated in cohorts of size three to six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable., 1 year
Overall Response, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 2 years
