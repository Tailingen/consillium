Study of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can show prostate cancer tumors on a PET scan; as well as see how long 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A lasts in the blood when given in small amounts. DFO-MSTP2109A is an antibody that works against STEAP1 - found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Attached to the DFO-MSTP2109A is a radioactive material called 89ZR, which allows it to be imaged by a PET scanner. The results of this study may help researchers know whether 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can be used as a diagnostic agent for finding prostate cancer that have STEAP1 on its surface with a PET scanner. The reason why identifying STEAP1 on prostate cancer cells is that new therapies are being developed to target STEAP1 prostate cancer cells.

DRUG: 89Zr- DFO-MSTP2109A|DRUG: 89Zr DFO-MSTP2109A
Percentage of Participants With Histologically Positive Lesions That Are Positive on Imaging, Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if 75% of the patients are antibody-imaging-positive. We will enroll 6 patients (cohort 1A) at the 10mg dose level for an initial decision on feasibility. If 4 or more of these patients have 20% or more of their active lesions detectable by 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A then we will consider the agent feasible for imaging, otherwise we will proceed to cohort 1B. If the true feasibility rate is 40%, this rule will affords more than 82% chance that cohort 1B will be opened for enrollment; this probability is less than 17% if the true feasibility is 75%., 2 years|Number of Participants Evaluated for AEs, All participants will be evaluated for adverse events which will be graded for intensity on a scale of 0 to 5. Severity grades will be recorded and based on the CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events will be defined graded using CTCAE V4.0., 2 years|Rate of Clearance of Tracer 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, Serial blood draws will be used to estimate the pharmacokinetic profile of the 10mg 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A in this patient population. Blood samples will be obtained in green top tube: Just prior to injection of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A (baseline)Approximately 5 ± 2, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19, and 120 to 240 minutes after injection of the tracer. One sample at the time of each subsequent day of imaging (24 + 8h, \~48-96h and \~120-168h post injection)., up to 168 hours|Biodistribution/SUVmax, A PET-CT scan extending from top of skull to mid thighs will be performed to determine the biodistribution/SUVmax in bone and soft tissue, 2 years
