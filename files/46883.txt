Comparison of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous Administration of Bortezomib in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
In this open-label randomised phase I trial, bortezomib will be administrated to 2 groups of 10 patients with MM who have inclusion criteria use the extended 2nd line indication, either intravenously (group 1 = 10 patients) or subcutaneously (group 2 = 10 patients). The schedule of administration of bortezomib will be the following : 1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without treatment, for up to eight cycles, either IV (group 1) or SC (group 2).

The primary objective is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the 2 routes of administration.

The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacodynamics (20S proteasome inhibition in whole blood), toxicity, including cardiac safety, and efficacy of the 2 routes of administration.
