A Phase I Study of TQ-B3395 on Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics
To study the pharmacokinetic characteristics of TQ-B3395 in the human body, recommend a reasonable regimen for subsequent research.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: TQ-B3395
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TQ-B3395, The highest dose at which no more than 33% of the subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment, 48 weeks|The type of dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLT[s]) of TQ-B3395, Subjects within 28 days after treatment appear the following toxicity reaction relate to the drug ：II °or above of kidney damage，III °or above of non-hematological toxicity,IV°hematological toxicity ,Neutropenia associated with fever, For 4 weeks for DLTs.|Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3395 (in whole blood):Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax), Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax),Cmax in ng/mL.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H3/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D21（D means Day）., up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3395 (in whole blood):Peak time（Tmax）, Peak time（Tmax）,Tmax in h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H3/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D21（D means Day）, up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3395 (in whole blood):Half life（t1/2）, Half life（t1/2）,t1/2 in h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H3/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D21（D means Day）, up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3395 (in whole blood):Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC in ng.h/mL.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H3/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D21（D means Day）, up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3395 (in whole blood):Clearance（CL）, Clearance（CL）,CL in L/h.In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H1/H2/H3/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D14/D21（D means Day）, up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), each 56 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)
