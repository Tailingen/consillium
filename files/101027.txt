Single Patient Protocol for an NRG1 Fusion Positive Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patient Using Seribantumab
NRG1 gene fusions are extremely rare across solid tumours (estimate 0.3-0.5%). However, it is felt to be an actionable and potentially major growth pathway for those tumours that harbour this gene rearrangement. Tumours that harbour NRG1 fusions are driven by HER3 overactivation. Seribantumab is a mono-clonal antibody against HER3, it binds HER3 and inhibits NRG1-dependent activation and HER2 dimerization.
