Dumping Syndrome and Quality of Life After Vagus Nerve-preserving Distal Gastrectomy
There is no consensus on what type of function-preserving gastrectomy can provide the best patient quality of life (QOL). This study aims to evaluate the incidence of dumping syndrome after vagus nerve-preserving distal gastrectomy (VPNDG).
Stomach Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Vagus nerve-preserving distal gastrectomy
Dumping syndrome, Sigstad score of equal or more than 7, 1 year
EORTC C-30/STO22, Quality of life surveys, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year|Postoperative complication, incidence of postoperative complication, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year|Incidence of gallstones, Found in follow-up CT or ultrasound, 1 year
Operative time, Time of operation, Immediately after operation|Estimated blood loss, Blood loss during operation, Immediately after operation|Time to first flatus, Postoperative day to first flatus, Within 1 week|Hospital stay, Total hospital stay, Within 1 week
The study is designed as a prospective observational phase II study with a follow-up period of 12 months. Patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer in the distal 2/3rd of the stomach who are planned to undergo laparoscopic VPNDG with Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy will be enrolled. Primary endpoint is incidence of dumping syndrome defined by Sigstad score 7 after a 3-month interval. Other outcomes include operative data, early complication, and patient QOL using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer C-30 and STO22 modules.
