A Study of TAVO412 in Patients with Cancer (TAVO412)
TAVO412 Phase 1 is an open-label, non-randomized, 2-part Phase I study to examine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of TAVO412. Part 1 will utilize a standard 3 + 3 design to determine the MTD/RP2D of TAVO412 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who progressed on prior approved standard of care therapy. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacologic activity of TAVO412 in a new set of subjects with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or subjects of other solid tumor types with best clinical responses (e.g., CR \> PR \> SD) from Part 1 that progressed on prior approved standard of care therapy.
Cancer
DRUG: TAVO412
Safety and Tolerability of TAVO412 according to Adverse Events and Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) using National Cancer Institute CTCAE v5.0, According to the frequency, duration, and severity of Adverse Events (AEs). The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is based on drug related adverse events and includes unacceptable hematologic toxicity, non-hematologic toxicity of Grade 3 or higher, or elevations in hepatic enzymes suggestive of drug-induced liver injury.

The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 has a minimum value of Grade 1, or mild, and a maximum value of Grade 4, Life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated. All DLTs will be assessed by the investigator using National Cancer Institute CTCAE v5.0., Approximately 12 months
Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of TAVO412, The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of TAVO412., Approximately 12 months|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax) of TAVO412, The Tmax is defined as time to reach maximum observed serum concentration of TAVO412., Approximately 12 months|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of TAVO412, The Cmin is the minimum observed serum concentration of TAVO412., Approximately 12 months|Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From 0-1 (AUC[t0-t1]), The AUC(t0-t1) is the area under the serum TAVO412 concentration-time curve from time t0 to t1., Approximately 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR), Approximately 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from earliest date of disease response (CR or PR) until earliest date of disease progression., Approximately 12 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug until the earliest date of disease progression., Approximately 12 months|Duration of Disease Control (CR, PR, and SD), Duration of disease control is defined as the sum of PFS followed by maintenance., Approximately 12 months
This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase I study to determine the safety and tolerability, define the MTD/RP2D, and assess the preliminary efficacy of TAVO412 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who progressed on prior approved standard of care therapy. Subjects will receive TAVO412 at the tested dose intravenously on Day 1 and 15 in Cycle 1 and will continue this bi-weekly treatment schedule for all future cycles.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

Part 1 - Dose Escalation will determine the MTD and/or RP2D of TAVO412, which includes defining the optimal dose administration schedule.

Part 2 - Cohort Expansion will evaluate the recommended dose and administration schedule (MTD/RP2D) determined in Part 1 in a new set of subjects with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or subjects of other solid tumor types with best clinical responses (e.g., CR \> PR \> SD) from Part 1 that progressed on prior approved standard of care therapy.
