A Trial to Learn if Odronextamab is Safe and Well-Tolerated and How Well it Works Compared to Rituximab Combined With Different Types of Chemotherapy for Participants With Follicular Lymphoma
This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug. The study is focused on participants with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or NHL).

This study will be made up of two parts: Part 1 (non-randomized) and Part 2 (randomized - controlled).

The aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is when given alone.

The aim of Part 2 of the study is to see how the study drug works compared to rituximab (called the "comparator drug") and chemotherapy (the current standard of care for NHL). Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
* How the study drug affects quality of life and ability to complete routine daily activities.

For the functioning scales and global health status / QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Part 2, Up to 5 years|PFS as assessed by the local investigator, Part 2, Up to 5 years|EFS as assessed by the local investigator, Part 2, Up to 5 years|Objective response assessed by local investigator, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Objective response assessed by independent central review, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Duration of response (DOR) assessed by independent central review, Part 2, Up to 5 years|DOR assessed by local investigator, Part 2, Up to 5 years|Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), Part 2, Up to 5 years|Incidence of TEAEs, Part 2, Up to 2 years|Severity of TEAEs, Part 2, Up to 2 years|Odronextamab concentrations in serum during the induction period, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Odronextamab concentrations in serum during the maintenance period, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Incidence of ADAs to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Titer of ADAs to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Incidence of NAbs to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Overall mean changes in scores of patient reported outcomes (PROs), as measured by the validated instruments EORTCQLQ- C30, Part 2 The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a global health status (GHS)/QoL scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, shortness of breath, appetite loss and financial difficulties).

All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4). Higher scores are associated with a worse quality of life., Up to 5 years|Overall mean changes in scores of PROs, as measured by the validated instruments Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), Part 2 The PGIS includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past 7 days. Patients will choose the response that best describes the severity of their overall cancer symptoms with options on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (No symptoms) to 4 (Very Severe)., Up to 5 years|Overall mean changes in scores of PROs, as measured by the validated instruments Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Part 2 The PGIC item includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives their overall change in health status since the start of study treatment.
