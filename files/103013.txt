Reshaping Postpartum Follow-up
The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of personalized postpartum follow-up cards on completion of postpartum health related tasks. The intervention will consist of a card given to patients at time of discharge. One side of the card will list the patient's name and a list of recommended postpartum follow-up appointments based on their diagnoses at the time of discharge. Participants will be randomized to this intervention or the control group, which will consist of standard education routinely given at discharge.

The primary endpoint will be the rate of completion of a postpartum blood pressure check or two hour glucose tolerance test, or both, depending on the patient's discharge diagnosis within the first year after discharge. The secondary endpoints will include establishing care with a primary care provider within the first year after delivery, or completion of postpartum pap smear or colposcopy, as indicated.
