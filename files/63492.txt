Non-Interventional Study to Examine Rituximab Treatment in Follicular Lymphoma Participants
It is a non-interventional study with a duration of approximately 24 months per participant to investigate the therapeutic efficiency, safety and treatment regimens of Rituximab maintenance therapy in daily routine in participants with previously untreated, relapsed or refractory cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)-positive follicular lymphoma (FL) in clinical practice.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab
Percentage of Participants Who Were Alive and Free From Progressive Disease, Progressive Disease is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking) as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions (target and non-target lesions) or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 2 years
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first cycle to the first occurrence of progression of tumor or death from any reason (whichever occurred first). If progression or death was not observed during the study, progression-free survival time was censored by the last documented tumor assessment during the maintenance therapy (latest at the end of study after two years). Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions (target and non-target lesions) or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. PFS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimate., 2 years|Percentage of Participants Who Were Alive, Death for any reason was regarded as an event. Percentage of participants who were alive after 2 years of maintenance therapy with Rituximab was reported., 2 years|Median Overall Survival (OS) Time, Survival was the interval of time from date of first dose of study medication to date of death at any time. Participants who had not died were censored at the date of last contact when they were known to be alive. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimate., 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Response (Complete Response [CR], Partial Response [PR], Stable Disease [SD] or Progressive Disease [PD] at the End of Maintenance Therapy, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR is defined as at least a 30 percentage (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the screening sum longest diameter; SD for target lesions is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started and SD for non-target lesions defined as persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions (target and non-target lesions) or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response, The percentage of participants was presented with respect to the best overall response (CR, PR, SD). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the screening sum longest diameter; SD for target lesions is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started and SD for non-target lesions defined as persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Initiation of New Therapy, Percentage of participants for whom new therapy was initiated at the end of maintenance therapy was reported., 2 years
