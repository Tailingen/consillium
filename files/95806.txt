Accuracy of the D-Dimer Assay for the Exclusion of Pulmonary Embolism in a High Risk Oncologic Population
The purpose of this study is to see if a blood test (D-dimer) is as precise as the CT scan for the detection of clots.

A pulmonary embolism is an obstruction of the blood vessels in your lungs usually due to a blood clot that travels to the lungs usually from the leg. Research has shown that the results of a specific blood test (D-dimer) can be used instead of a CT scan to diagnose clots. D-dimer is a valuable diagnostic marker in either detecting the presence of or monitoring the progress of blood clots. D-dimer assays have proven to be a beneficial diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).
Cancer|Pulmonary Embolism
PROCEDURE: CT pulmonary angiogram and d-dimer draw
The negative predictive value of the d-dimer assay relative to CT pulmonary angiogram will be the primary measure of accuracy used for this purpose., conclusion of study
To estimate the positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the d-dimer assay relative to CT pulmonary angiogram., conclusion of study|To explore the association between the accuracy of the d-dimer assay and clinical symptoms indicating pulmonary embolism., conclusion of study
