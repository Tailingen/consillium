Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Lanreotide AutogelÂ® in Chinese Participants With GEP-NETs
This study will be conducted to support the registration of the lanreotide Autogel 120 mg formulation in China for the treatment of GEP-NETs and treatment of clinical symptoms of NETs.

The study will include a screening period of up to 4 weeks followed by a 48-week intervention period. After completion of the main study period, five participants will continue in a self/partner injection cohort with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 28 days for 24 weeks.

DRUG: Lanreotide autogel
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) of Tumour Response Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) at Week 24, The CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR), or continued stable disease (SD) until the time of assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria v1.1. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. The SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 24
Progression Free Survival (PFS) by BICR Within Weeks 24 and 48, The PFS was defined as the time from the first administration of study intervention to the date of the first documented PD measured using RECIST criteria v1.1 and confirmed by BICR, or death from any cause, whichever comes first. The PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PD was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 24 and 48|Overall Survival (OS) at the End of the Main Intervention Period, The OS was defined as the time from the first administration of study intervention to the date of death from any cause. The OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Week 48 (end of the main intervention period)|Time to Progression (TTP) During Main Intervention Period, The TTP was defined as the time from the first administration of study intervention to the date of the first documented PD, or clinical progression confirmed by the investigator. The TTP was assessed by BICR and estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PD was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48|Percentage of Participants Alive and Without Tumour Progressive at Weeks 24 and 48, Percentage of participants who were alive and progression free per RECIST v1.1 using BICR assessments at 24 and 48 weeks after first dose of study intervention were reported. The PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PD was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 24 and 48|Clinical Benefit Rate Assessed by BICR at Week 48, The CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or continued SD until the time of assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. The SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Week 48|Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Weeks 24 and 48, The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 24 and 48|Disease Control Rate (DCR) at Weeks 24 and 48, The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR or SD. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. The SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 24 and 48|Number of Participants With Neuroendocrine Tumours (NET)-Related Clinical Symptoms at Weeks 24 and 48, The presence or absence of endocrine symptoms of NETs (example; flushing, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, sweating, tremor, palpitation, or erythema) were assessed by the investigator at screening. In participants with symptoms of NETs at screening, a baseline assessment of the symptoms experienced in the last 4 weeks was performed by questioning before study intervention administration at Day 1. These symptoms were recorded in the case report form and severity graded upon National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Where, Grade 1= mild, Grade 2= moderate, Grade 3= severe, Grade 4= life-threatening and Grade 5= death., Weeks 24 and 48|Change From Baseline in Plasma Chromogranin A (CgA) at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48, The CgA determination was useful for staging, prognosis and follow up, since the serum concentration correlated to the tumour mass. Blood samples were collected to measure circulating CgA., Baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48|Change From Baseline in 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid (5-HIAA) at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48, Urine samples were collected to measure 5-HIAA., Baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire for Cancer participants contains 30 single items. For questions 1 to 28, score ranges from 1 to 4 where, 1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit and 4= very much. Global health status/QoL contains questions 29 and 30 and score ranges from 1 to 7, where 1= very poor and 7= excellent. Total score ranges from 0 (poor) to 100 (excellent). Higher score indicates a high QoL., Baseline (within 28 days before start of study intervention) and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48
