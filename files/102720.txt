A Study of NovoTTF-200T(P) in Combination With Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel for Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This is a single arm phase II study. All patients will receive 3 cycles of the treatment of nab-paclitaxel (Days 1, 8 and 15), gemcitabine (Days 1, 8 and 15), and TTFields (worn every day for at least 18 hours). Following the initial 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment, patients will undergo restaging by CT or MRI. Patients with stable disease or better will undergo surgery for resection within 8 weeks following completion of initial chemotherapy although enrolling sites are encouraged to perform resection within 4 weeks of Cycle 3 D15 of therapy. If resection yields R0 or R1, patients will begin an additional 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment within 8 weeks of surgery. Based on available literature, it is expected that a percentage of patients will not undergo resection either due to disease progression or due to toxicities/ complications of the neoadjuvant segment of therapy. These patients will be included in the evaluable patients for both co-primary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints including ORR, adverse events, and OS.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DEVICE: NovoTTF-200T(P)
2 Year Overall Survival (OS), Determine the two-year OS rate. Two-year (2-Y) OS will be calculated as the percentage of patients who remain alive at the 2 year mark from the registration date., 2 years|Rate of Resection, Determine the rate of resection following the neoadjuvant treatment with TTFields in combination with chemotherapy. Resectability rate will be calculated as the proportion of evaluable patients undergoing R0 or R1 resection following the neoadjuvant segment of therapy., 4 years
Assess adverse events, Assess frequency and severity of adverse events when TTFields is added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy using CTCAE v5 criteria. Adverse Events (AE): AEs and the maximum grade for each type of adverse events will be summarized for each patient separately for the following three periods:

* During perioperative therapy
* Complications during surgery and post-operative period for 30 days
* During adjuvant therapy, 3 months, 5 months, and 10 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Determine ORR. Overall response rate will include confirmed complete response (CR) + confirmed partial response (PR) and will be determined as per RECIST v1.1., 4 years|Post Resection Disease Free Survival (DFS), Estimate the post resection DFS. DFS will be estimated in patients undergoing resection and will be defined as the date of resection to the date of first documentation of recurrence (loco-regional or distant) or death due to any cause., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), Estimate the median OS is defined as the time from initiation of therapy to death from any cause. OS will be assessed from date of registration till death from any cause on an intention to treat basis., 4 years|Rate of Major Histological Response, Assess the patterns and rate of major histological response.Pathologic response will be evaluated after the patient has had surgery, and will be based on local pathology review of the resected surgical specimen, according to the following (Treatment effect assessment will be per "College of American Pathology Protocol for the Examination of Specimens From Patients With Carcinoma of the Exocrine Pancreas")

Tumor Regression Grade:

* 0: Complete response - no residual tumor
* 1: Moderate response - minimal residual cancer (single cells or small groups of cancer cells)
* 2: Minimal response - residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis
* 3: Poor or no response - no definite response identified (minimal or no tumor kill; Extensive residual cancer), 4 years|Patterns of Recurrence, Describe the patterns of recurrence. Pattern of recurrence will be assessed for patients undergoing resection and will be categorized into local vs distant. Loco-regional recurrence will be defined as any evidence of new disease within the pancreatic tumor bed based on surveillance scans. The pancreatic tumor bed includes:

* Superior mesenteric artery and vein lymph nodes
* Lymph nodes in porta hepatis (bile duct, portal vein, hepatic artery lymph nodes)
* Lymph nodes around left renal vein, inferior vena cava or aorta
* Celiac axis lymph nodes, 4 years|Time to Locoregional Recurrence (TLR), Evaluate TLR. TLR is defined as the time from the date of registration to the date of locoregional recurrence after resection., 4 years|Time to Distant Metastases (TDM), Evaluate TDM. Time to Distant Metastases (TDM): TDM is defined as the time from the date of registration to the date of metastases prior to surgery, metastases detected during surgery, or distant recurrence after resection., 4 years|Chemotherapy relative dose intensity, Chemotherapy relative dose intensity delivered per agent is defined as the total cumulative dose (both perioperative and adjuvant) the patient received divided by total dose planned per protocol, times 100%., 4 years|TTFields Compliance Rate, Evaluate compliance with TTFields. The device will be inspected either by the investigator or by a Novocure representative on a monthly basis to assess patient compliance with therapy. Average number of daily hours will be calculated., 4 years
