A Randomized, Comparative Study of Hexvix Fluorescence Cystoscopy and Standard Cystoscopy in Patients With Non-invasive Bladder Cancer
The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer.

The hypothesis is to test whether the 1-year recurrence rate is different with Hexvix assisted TURB compared to standard white light TURB.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Hexvix|OTHER: Standard white light cystoscopy
Proportion of Patients With Histologically Confirmed Recurrence Within One 1 Year., To compare tumour recurrence rates after standard (white light) and fluorescence guided transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in patients with macroscopic non-muscle invasive bladder tumour., 1 year
Proportion of Patients in the Hexvix Cystoscopy Group Who Had at Least One Additional Lesion Found by Hexvix Cystoscopy That Was Not Found by White Light Cystoscopy., At day 0|False Positive Detection Rate Patient Level, 12 months
The main objective of the study is to compare the 1-year recurrence rate of Hexvix assisted Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer.

Patients will be followed 4, 8 and 12 months after the initial TURB. This follow-up regimen is according to standard clinical practice in Denmark.

Recurrence of non-invasive bladder cancer is frequent, and this study is designed to investigate whether Hexvix assisted TURB can reduce the early recurrence compared to standard TURB
