A Phase 2 Study Evaluating Olutasidenib in Combination With Hypomethylating Agents in Patients With IDH1-mutated Higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, or Advanced Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
To learn if olutasidenib, when combined with a drug called a hypomethylating agent (HMA) can help to control MDS, CMML, and/or MPN. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.
Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Advanced Myeloproliferative Neoplasms|IDH1-mutated Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Olutasidenib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives To determine the overall response rate of olutasidenib in combination with investigator's choice of HMA in patients with IDH1-mutated higher-risk MDS/CMML or advanced MPN Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* To evaluate the rates of complete remission (CR) and median duration of CR
* To ascertain the safety and tolerability of olutasidenib with HMA in this participant population
* To determine survival including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) To analyze reduction in IDH1 clone size Exploratory Objectives
* To examine overall response rate of patients previously exposed to venetoclax
* To investigate global gene expression profiles, DNA methylation profiles, and other potential prognostic markers to explore predictors of antitumor activity and/or resistance to treatment
