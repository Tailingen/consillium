A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Flumatinib in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase.
It's a double-blind , randomized ,multi-center study. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of flumatinib 400mg once daily (QD) versus 600mg QD as the first line therapy in patients with chronic myleiod leukemia(CML) in chronic phase(CP).
CML, Chronic Phase
DRUG: Flumatinib mesylate tablets (400mg)|DRUG: Flumatinib mesylate tablets (600mg)
Early molecular response(EMR) rate at 3 months, Molecular response is assessed using BCR-ABL transcript levels and measured by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RQ-PCR). Early molecular response is defined as a ratio BCR-ABL/ABL ≤10% on the international scale (IS)., 3 months
Major molecular response(MMR) rate at month 3,6,9 and 12, Major molecular response is defined as a ratio BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.1% on the international scale as measured by RQ-PCR., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|MR4.0 rate at month 3,6,9 and 12, MR4.0 is defined as BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.01% on the international scale., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|MR4.5 rate at month 3,6,9 and 12, MR4.5 is defined as BCR-ABL/ABL ≤0.0032% on the international scale., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|Complete cytogenetic response（CCyR）rate at month 3,6,9 and 12, Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Ph+ cells in metaphase from bone marrow (BM) sample . CCyR is defined as 0% Ph+ metaphases in the bone marrow., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|Complete hematologic response(CHR) rate at month 1,2,3,4,5,6,9 and 12, Hematologic response will be assessed by complete blood count (CBC) and physical examination at each visit. CHR is defined as all of the following present:

1. white blood cell(WBC) count \<10×109/L
2. Platelet count \<450 ×109/L
3. Peripheral blood basophils \<5%
4. No blasts and no promyelocytes in peripheral blood
5. \< 5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes in peripheral blood
6. No evidence of extramedullary disease, including no splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, 1,2,3,4,5,6,9 and 12 months|Time to first MMR, Evaluate the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented MMR during treatment., up to 36 months|Time to first CCyR, Evaluate the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented CCyR during treatment., up to 36 months|Duration of MMR, Duration of MMR is defined as the time from the date of first documented MMR to the earliest date of loss of MMR., up to 36 months|Duration of CCyR, Duration of CCyR is defined as the time from the date of first documented CCyR to the earliest date of loss of CCyR., up to 36 months|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest occurrence of the following events: death due to any cause ; loss of CHR ,loss of PCyR ;loss of CCyR ; discontinuation of study treatment due to AE or treatment failure ; progression to AP/BC, up to 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest occurrence of progression to AP/BC or death from any cause., up to 36 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Frame:12 and 36 months|The incidence and severity of adverse events ((AE), Assessed by number and severity of adverse events as recorded on the case report form NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 36 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of HS-10096：Tmax, Serum concentrations of HS-10096 will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of HS-10096.Tmax is the time to reach maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration after dose administration (hr)., Up to approximately 36 months
This is a dose-optimization study of flumatinib in adult patient with newly diagnosed CML-CP. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of flumatinib 400mg QD with that of 600mg QD. Eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either fluamtinib 400mg QD or flumatinib 600mg QD. Randomization is stratified based on Sokal risk score (\<0.8,0.8\~1.2,\>1.2). Patients will discontinue study therapy due to treatment failure, disease progression or intolerance to study medication or due to investigator's or participant's decision. The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of early molecular response , as measured by RQ-PCR at 3 months. Hematologic response, molecular response and cytogenetic response will be assessed at baseline and a certain frequency after treatment, until study completion.
