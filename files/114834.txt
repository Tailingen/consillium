Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 Compared to F-18-FCH PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Patients
Prostate cancer patients for whom a F-18-FCH PET/CT is indicated. Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 is a new PET/CT radiotracer aiming at giving complementary information : more precise images and early localisation of recurrence to standard imaging
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 1 PET/CT with F-18-FCH + 1 PET/CT with Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9
Positivity of the new radiotracer Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 compared to the standard radiotracer F-18-FCH, PET images : SUVmax, SUVmean, VOI (mL), SUV41% lesions/ SUVbackground CT images : size lesions measured in 3D (axial, coronal and sagittal), density in Hounsfield Units (HU), At baseline (after F-18-FCH PET/CT)
Patient with primary or relapsing prostate cancer for whom F-18-FCH PET/CT is indicated will be proposed to participate to the present study. After signing the patient informed consent, both F-18-FCH and Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 PET/CT will be scheduled with a maximum 10 day-interval.

No adverse events are expected.
