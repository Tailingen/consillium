Fulvestrant + Neratinib In Breast Cancer
This is a Phase 2 open label, multi-center non-randomized interventional study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining Neratinib plus Fulvestrant in previously treated metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

* This research study involves the study drug Neratinib
* The standard of care drug Fulvestrant

DRUG: NERATINIB|DRUG: FULVESTRANT
Objective response rates (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR per Investigator's assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to 33 Months
Time-to-Tumor Response (TTR), defined for patients with confirmed objective response (CR or PR) as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor response, Up to 33 Months|Cumulative Objective Response Incidence, defined as the cumulative proportion of patients with an objective response (CR or PR) after study treatment. The cumulative number of patients with an OR will be determined at the end of each time period and the cumulative incidence will then be calculated., Up to 33 Months|Duration of response (DOR), is defined for patients with confirmed objective response (CR or PR) as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DR will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and descriptive statistics., Up to 33 Months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of progression by RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and descriptive statistics., Up to 33 Months|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of death. OS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and descriptive statistics., Up to 33 Months|Number of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed NCI CTCAE (version 5.0), NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) criteria for adverse events, first treatment day to death up to 33 Months|CELsignia score and Objective Response, The correlation between quantitative CELsignia score and OR, will be assessed to evaluate different cut-off values and corresponding treatment responses. CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test, Up to 33 Months|CELsignia score and CB, The correlation between quantitative CELsignia score and CB, will be assessed to evaluate different cut-off values and corresponding treatment responses. (CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test), Up to 33 Months|CELsignia score and Progression Free Survival, The correlation between quantitative CELsignia score and PFS, will be assessed to evaluate different cut-off values and corresponding treatment responses. (CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test), up to 33 months|CELsignia score and molecular alterations in plasma, The correlation between quantitative CELsignia score and molecular alterations in plasma, particularly HER2 mutations. ( CELsignia HER2 Pathway Activity Test), Up to 33 Months
* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

  * This research study involves the study drug Neratinib
  * The standard of care drug Fulvestrant
* It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study.
* This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Neratinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
* The FDA has approved Fulvestrant as a treatment option for this disease. Fulvestrant is a standard of care drug that will be administered.
