Assessing The Effectiveness of a Preoperative High Intensity Interval Training Programme In Older Colorectal Cancer Patients
The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an improvement in aerobic fitness, as judged by an increase in VO2peak, can be achieved within 31 days via HIT programme in a group of older, colorectal cancer patients.
Preoperative Care|Colorectal Neoplasms|Aged|Exercise
BEHAVIORAL: HIT
VO2 peak, Mean difference in VO2 peak following a HIT programme, After 31 days of HIT
Anaerobic threshold, Mean difference in anaerobic threshold following a HIT programme, After 31 days of HIT|Muscle protein synthesis, Assessment of D2O evaluated muscle protein synthesis following HIT programme, After 31 days of HIT|Body composition, DXA and USS assessed changes in lean muscle mass and architecture following a HIT programme, After 31 days of HIT|Feasibility, Determination of patient compliance and adherence to HIT programme, After 31 days of HIT|Quality of life, Quality of life and performance questionnaires to measure subjective outcomes (EQ-5D, IPAQ, DASI, WEMWBS), After 31 days of HIT
12 high intensity interval training exercise sessions on a static cycle ergometer, over a period of 31 days. Each session lasts 18 minutes.

At the beginning and end of the study the following measures will be used to assess change in fitness, body composition and muscle metabolism. DXA scan, USS of thigh, VO2 peak cycling test, short performance battery tests, quality of life questionnaires and muscle biopsy.
