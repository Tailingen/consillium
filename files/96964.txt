The Effect of GLP-1 Agonists Versus OCs on Reproductive Disorders and Cardiovascular Risks in Overweight PCOS
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects one in 10 women of childbearing age, which is usually characterized by hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems such as hyperandrogenism and obesity. Diane 35 pills are classified as oral contraceptives, which effectively reduces circulating androgens and are treatment for hyperandrogenism caused androgenic skin symptoms and irregular menstrual cycles. GLP-1 Receptor Agonist(e.g. exenatide, liraglutide) have the effects of lowering blood sugar and weight control by inhibiting of gastric emptying and reducing food intake. This study aims to evaluate the effect of metformin-GLP-1 Receptor agonist combination versus metformin-Diane-35 combination treatment on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risks in overweight polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.
