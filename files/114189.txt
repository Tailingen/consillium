Metronomic Chemotherapy in Elderly Non-fit Patients With Aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas
This is a phase II study of metronomic chemotherapy in elderly non-fit patients (\>65 years) with aggressive B-Cell lymphomas
Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Rituximab
Complete Remission Rate (CRR), The primary efficacy endpoint is defined in terms of complete response (CR), including complete response unconfirmed (CRu), according to Recommendations of an International Workshop to Standardise Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin´s Lymphomas., 30 months|Incidence of adverse events, The primary safety endpoint is defined as incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, 30 months
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a CR (including CRu) or a PR., 30 months|Clinical Benefit, Defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a CR (including CRu), a PR and a SD., 30 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from registration to the first occurrence of progression or relapse or death for any cause other causes than lymphoma, or the date of last follow-up in censored patients., 36|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS, defined as the time from registration until: early withdrawal, less than CRu, relapse or progression or death by other causes than lymphoma in patients who achieved CR or CRu after the EOI phase., 36|Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS: calculated for patients in CR/CRu after induction phase, from the date of response/end treatment until relapse, death by other causes than lymphoma or last follow-up in censored patients., 36|Overall Survival (OS), OS, calculated from the date of registration until death for any cause or last follow-up in censored patients., 36|Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO), PRO per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life (QLQ-30) questionnaire, 36
Patients eligible for the study will receive 6 courses (q 28 days) of the DEVEC combination, according to the following schedule:

* DE: Prednisone (Deltacortene) 25 mg /day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 28 only in cycle 1 From cycle 2 to 6 it is reduced to three times a week (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI)
* V: Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1 week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).
* E: Etoposide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 14 (before lunch).
* C: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 21 (after dinner).
* Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 will be administered by IV infusion up to four infusions on days 8, 15, 22, 29, only in patients suitable for infusion treatment and relapsed after \>6 months from last R-chemotherapy. Refractory patients who had received at least 5 doses of Rituximab will not repeat it during the metronomic therapy.

Super-frail patients will not receive etoposide during cycles 1 and 2; etoposide will be included in the treatment schedule starting from cycle 3 at reduced dose (50 mg/day, from day 1 to day 7) only in patients who in cycles 1 and 2 didn't experience hematological toxicity \>G2 and/or non-hematological toxicity \>G1.

In Unfit and Frail patients with hemoglobin level at study entry \<11 gr/dL, will start etoposide will be orally administered at reduced dose (50 mg/day from day 1 to day 7). If hemoglobin will raise to ≥11 gr/dL, at subsequent induction cycles etoposide will be administered at full dose (50 mg/day, from day 1 to day 14), As a preventive measure, to avoid perforation, patients with gastrointestinal visceral involvement will receive a pre-phase therapy with steroids (prednisolone 40mg/m2

) for 6-7 days before starting protocol treatment. Moreover, in these patients the four Rituximab doses will be administered in cycle 2.

Patients in CR, CRu, PR and SD after 2 cycles will continue with additional 4 courses.

At the end of the induction phase patients in CR, CRu and PR (and also in SD at discretion of local investigator) will continue treatment with maintenance therapy including Vinorelbine, Cyclophosphamide, and Prednisone oral combination to be repeated every 28 days for up to 6 cycles, according to the following schedule:

* Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day will be orally administered from day 1 to day 14 (after dinner).
* Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1 week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).
* Prednisone 25 mg/day will be orally administered twice a week (after breakfast, MON, FRI).

Patients in CR/CRu at the EOT can continue with a post-maintenance phase at discretion of the local investigator up to 12 months, progression or inacceptable toxicity, according to following schedule:

* Vinorelbine 30 mg/day will be orally administered three times a week, 3 week on and 1 week off (after breakfast, MON, WED, FRI).
* Prednisone 25 mg/day will be orally administered twice a week (after breakfast, MON, FRI).

Patients with evidence of Progressive Disease (PD) at any point will stop treatment.
