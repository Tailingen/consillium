Phase 1 Study of NY-ESO-1 Overlapping Peptides in Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
This was a Phase 1, open-label study of repeated vaccination with NY-ESO-1 overlapping peptides (OLP4) with or without the immunoadjuvants Montanide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid - poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) administered every 3 weeks for a total of 5 vaccinations in subjects with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in second or third clinical remission. Study objectives included determination of the safety and immunogenicity following vaccination.

Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Analysis of TEAEs reported from clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from pre-treatment through 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment., Continuously for up to 16 weeks
Number of Patients With Detectable Serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Antibody Titers Against NY-ESO-1 Up to 16 Weeks Post-Baseline, Blood samples were drawn to measure immunologic response at Screening and Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. Specific antibodies against NY-ESO-1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., Screening and Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16|Number of Patients With Detectable CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell Responses Up to 16 Weeks Post-Baseline, Blood samples were drawn to measure immunologic response at Screening and Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell reactivity was measured by tetramer analysis (in human leukocyte antigen \[HLA\] 0201\* patients). Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release by T cells was measured by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. A subject was considered to have experienced a T-cell response if IFN-γ spots were detectable (\>50 spots) by ELISPOT of 50,000 CD8+ and CD4+ T cells following pre-sensitization with a pool of 20-mer OLP covering all of NY-ESO-1 and tested against Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells pulsed with 3 subpools of these peptides., Screening and Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16|Number of Patients With Delayed-type Hypersensitivity (DTH) Reactions (Induration and Redness) to NY-ESO-1 OLP4 at Screening and Week 16, NY-ESO-1-specific DTH was measured by skin tests at Screening and again at Week 16. NY-ESO-1 OLP4 (40 µg in 0.1 mL D5W) was injected intradermally, with DTH reactions read 48 hours after injection., Screening and Week 16|Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 Levels Up to 16 Weeks Post-Baseline, Serum CA-125 was measured at Screening, Week 7, and Week 16. Stable CA-125 at baseline was \< 35 U/mL (defined as CA-125 that had not doubled from the post chemotherapy nadir)., Screening, Week 7, and Week 16|Tumor Measurement Results According to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) Up to 16 Weeks Post-Baseline, Radiographic imaging (computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis) was obtained at Screening and every 2 months during the study, and at unscheduled time points if any clinical symptoms/examination findings warranted further evaluation or if serum CA-125 rose to \> 70 U/mL (confirmed by repeat value). Subjects may have had more than 1 location of disease., Screening and every 2 months up to Week 16
Subjects received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 by subcutaneous injection once every 3 weeks (Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13) for a total of 5 vaccinations.

Subjects were assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 dosing cohorts:

Cohort 1: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 alone; Cohort 2: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 in combination with Montanide; Cohort 3: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 in combination with Montanide and Poly-ICLC.

Enrollment into each subsequent dosing cohort was dependent on a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of \<33% in the preceding cohort. No dose escalation was planned.

Subjects were observed by study staff for up to 30 minutes following each vaccination. Immunologic assessments were performed prior to the first vaccination and 3 weeks after each vaccination. Toxicity assessments were performed with each vaccination and 3 weeks after the completion of therapy (ie, the final study visit was Week 16). Immunologic assessments included measurement of the anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay (ELISA), detection of CD-4 and CD-8 cellular responses by tetramer and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH).
