AssesSment of Early-deteCtion basEd oN liquiD Biopsy in Hepatobiliary Cancer Malignancies
This study is a prospective, multicenter study aimed to develop and validate the performance of combined assays for cfDNA methylation markers and serum tumor markers in early hepatobiliary malignancies detection. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation, blood RNA markers and tissue will also be evaluated. The study will enroll approximately 496 participants, including participants with malignant or benign diseases of the hepatobiliary system.
