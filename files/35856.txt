Coping and Attachment in Pediatric Oncohematology
Cancer can be a traumatic and particularly salient experience in a person's history. The ways in which the pediatric patient copes with it depend on the interaction of several factors present in his or her life context, primarily the relationship that is established between parent and child.

Despite the paucity of studies in the literature in this regard, it would seem that parental coping is predictive of child coping. Coping strategies represent the ways in which people try to manage traumatic events or stressful everyday situations.

Currently, the literature identifies two main categories of coping strategies: emotion-oriented and problem-oriented strategies. The former are aimed on reducing stress-induced unpleasant emotions (e.g., problem avoidance, positive reappraisal, etc.); the latter, on the other hand, focus on stress dissolution/alteration (e.g., problem identification and resolution, stress cause research). Some studies, previously conducted in oncology, show that emotion-focused coping strategies are associated with better adaptation immediately after diagnosis, but their positive influence tends to weaken over time; problem-focused coping strategies are more correlated with poor adaptation immediately after diagnosis, but in the later stages of treatment.

The clinical experience with patients in the Pediatric Oncohematology Department brings out the need to develop and structure a psychological assessment model, in order to ensure a more effective care of the family units followed.

The research aims, through a single administration of psychological tests, to investigate the role of attachment and some variables (age, gender, stage of treatment, stage of the disease, social support, resilience, ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, emotional state of of caregivers) on the coping strategies implemented by the parents of patients and the patients themselves, in order to differentiate the types of psychological intervention, to try to reduce psychological distress and increase levels of mental well-being.

Child-Parent Relationship Scale, Child-Parent Relationship Scale is a 30-item, self-report instrument used to assess conflict and relational closeness, two important aspects in the emotional support provided to the child and compliance with care, as well as perceived parental distress. The Likert scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 stands for "Absolutely not true" and 5 stands for "Definitely true." Scoring is done by summing the raw scores of the items in the three sections (positive aspects of the relationship, conflict and dependence) divided by the items in each sub-scale (mean score)., One time just after the enrollment|Coping Orientations to Problem Experienced, "Coping Orientations to Problem Experienced- New Italian Version" is a self-report questionnaire that considers different coping modes. The Likert scale ranges from 1 to 4, where 1 stands for "I usually don't do it" and 4 stands for "I almost always do it." The instrument consists of 60 items, divided into 5 independent dimensions: social support, avoidance strategies, positive attitude, problem orientation and transcendent orientation. The scores from 1 to 4 are based on the responses identified by the subject for each item except for 4 "reverse" responses (items 8-20-36-50) for which the chosen score must be reversed. The items are then divided into groups for the identification of the 5 coping factors (social support, avoidance, positive attitude and transcendent orientation). Higher scores indicate greater use of that specific coping strategy., One time just after the enrollment
