This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carboplatin/cisplatin + etoposide + benmelstobart sequential benmelstobart combined with anlotinib versus carboplatin/cisplatin + etoposide + Tislelizumab sequential Tislelizumab in the first-line treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin for injection/cisplatin for injection + etoposide injection + benmelstobart injection + Anlotinib hydrochloride capsule|DRUG: Carboplatin for injection/Cisplatin for injection + etoposide injection + Tislelizumab injection
Progression free survival (PFS), The time from enrollment until the first onset of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From enrollment until the first onset of disease progression or death from any cause, evaluation is expected to take 2 years
12/24 month PFS rate, The percentage of subjects with no progression from the first dose to 12 and 24 months of total subjects., 12-month, 24-month|12/24 month Overall survival (OS) rate, The number of surviving subjects as a percentage of the total number of subjects from the first dose to 12 and 24 months., 12-month, 24-month|Overall survival (OS), The time between randomization and death from all causes., From randomization to death from all causes, evaluation is expected to take 5 years|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was assessed., Complete response time was achieved, evaluation is expected to take 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects who achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) was assessed., Complete response time was achieved, evaluation is expected to take 2 years|Incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), The incidence and severity of adverse events were determined according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 rating scale., Time of adverse event, evaluation is expected to take 2 years|Patient-reported Outcomes (PRO): Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).

Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 were used to evaluate PRO.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire is an established measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL)Methods, it is often used as the end point of tumor clinical trials.A score of 0-100, where higher scores indicate greater function, higher HRQoL, or higher symptom levels., PRO assessments were performed during the screening period, at the end of each even-numbered cycle, at the end of study treatment, and at safety follow-up in the order shown, baseline to 2 years|Patient-reported Outcomes (PRO): EORTC QLQ-LC13, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) QLQ-LC13 were used to evaluate PRO.The QLQ-LC13 is a 13-item self-filling questionnaire for lung cancer disease that will be associated with the EORTC Use QLQ-C30 together.4-point scale: "Not at all", "somewhat", "quite a bit" and "to a great extent", PRO assessments were performed during the screening period, at the end of each even-numbered cycle, at the end of study treatment, and at safety follow-up in the order shown, baseline to 2 years|Patient-reported Outcomes (PRO): European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 5 Levels, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 5 Levels were used to evaluate PRO. EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardized health status indicator developed by the EuroQol group, which asseses five dimensions: mobility, self-care, general activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.Each dimension has five response options that reflect increased difficulty (no problem, some problem, moderate problem, severe)Serious problem (extremely serious problem)., PRO assessments were performed during the screening period, at the end of each even-numbered cycle, at the end of study treatment, and at safety follow-up in the order shown, baseline to 2 years
