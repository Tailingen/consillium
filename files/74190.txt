A Study of MS-553 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase I/II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study which is divided into two portions: Phase I is dose escalation portion, in which subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma will be enrolled except malignant lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) and Burkitt lymphoma. After the RP2D is identified, Phase II of subjects with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who previously received ≥ 2 and ≤ 4 different chemotherapy and/or targeted drug therapy will be enrolled.
