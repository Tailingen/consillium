DRUG: Crizotinib
Independent Radiology Reviewed Overall Objective Response (ORR), Overall objective response (ORR) was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response or confirmed Partial Response according to RECIST v1.1 (as determined by Independent Radiology Review \[IRR\]), relative to the total population of response-evaluable participants. Per RECIST v1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis); PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response., Starting from the first dose study treatment until the first documented CR or PR (every 8 weeks then after 8 cycles at every 12 weeks in duration of 94.0 weeks)
IRR-Assessed Duration of Response (DR), DR: time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If no progression or death on study was observed, or given antitumor treatment other than study drug, participants were censored on date of last on-study tumor assessment. RECIST v1.1, a) PD: \>=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of \>=5 mm, appearance of 1 or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; b) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis); c) PR: \>=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters., From first documentation of objective tumor response to first documentation of objective PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (every 8 weeks then after 8 cycles at every 12 weeks in duration of 151.3 weeks)|IRR-Assessed Time to Tumor Response (TTR), TTR was defined as the time from the date of first dose to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), that was subsequently confirmed. For participants proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. RECIST v1.1 (as determined by IRR), a) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis); b) PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of first dose of crizotinib to first documentation of objective response was observed (every 8 weeks then after 8 cycles at every 12 weeks in duration of 151.3 weeks)|IRR Assessed Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 8 Weeks, DCR at 8 weeks was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) at 8 weeks, respectively, relative to the total population of response evaluable participants. RECIST v1.1 (as determined by IRR), a) CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis); b) PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., At 8 weeks after the start of study treatment|IRR-Assessed Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to first documentation of objective PD or to death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If no progression or death on study was observed, or given antitumor treatment other than study drug, participants were censored on date of last on-study tumor assessment. RECIST v1.1, PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From the date of first dose of crizotinib until the first documentation of objective PD or death (every 8 weeks then after 8 cycles at every 12 weeks in duration of 151.3 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to the date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time was censored on the last date the participants were known to be alive., From date of the first dose of crizotinib until the date of death from any cause (up to 291.9 weeks)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs, Treatment Emergent Treatment Related AEs and SAEs, Grade 3 or 4 Treatment Emergent AEs and Grade 3 or 4 Treatment Emergent Treatment Related AEs, Treatment-emergent AEs :between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to crizotinib was assessed by the investigator. Treatment-related AE: any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE):an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Grade 3 (Severe) events=unacceptable or intolerable events, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 (Life-threatening) events caused participant to be in imminent danger of death., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment (maximum up to 295.9 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Shift in Hematology Laboratory Results From Baseline Grade </=2 to Worst Grade 3 or Grade 4, Laboratory values included hemoglobin increased, anemia, platelet count decreased, leukocytosis, white blood cell decreased, lymphocyte count increased, lymphocyte count decreased and neutrophil count decreased. Laboratory values were defined as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI CTCAE v3.0) grade 3 or higher., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment (maximum up to 295.9 weeks)|Number of Participants With a Shift of Chemistry Laboratory Results From Baseline Grade </=2 to Worst Grade 3 or Grade 4, Laboratory values included blood bilirubin increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, hypoalbuminemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, Creatinine increased, hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Laboratory values were defined as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI CTCAE v3.0) grade 3 or higher., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment (maximum up to 295.9 weeks)|Change From Baseline to Cycle 60 in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions which are incorporated into 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); a global health status/global QOL scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and 6 single items that assess the additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance/insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. All the scales and single-item scores ranged from 0 to 100, higher score is indicative of a higher response level (high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning; high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL; a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems)., Baseline up to Cycle 60|Change From Baseline to Cycle 60 in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module 13 Scores, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia). Scores on each scale and item ranged from 0 to 100, higher score is indicative of a higher response level (a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems)., Baseline up to Cycle 60
