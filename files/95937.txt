Venetoclax Combined With Azacitidine and CAG in Refractory/Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine and CAG as induction regimen in Patients with Refreactory/Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Refractory/Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax
Overall response rate (ORR), The overall remission rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) per the International Working Group criteria for AML., up to 2 cycles from the start of VACAG regimen (each cycle is 28 days)
Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Percentage of participants who converted to MRD \< 10\^-3 by flow cytometry before initiation of consolidation therapy., up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability analysis will be assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., up to 2 years|Duration of myelosuppression, The duration of absolute value of peripheral blood neutrophils \<0.5×10\^9/L and platelet count \<50×10\^9/L during myelosuppression., up to 2 years|Leukaemia-free survival, Leukaemia-free survival will be defined as the time since date of CR until either relapse or death in remission., up to 2 years|Overall survival, Overall Survival be defined as the time from administration of the initial doses until death from any cause., up to 2 years
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (VA) and CAG (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and aclarubicin) as induction regimen in Patients with Refreactory/Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia(AML).

Previous studies have shown that venetoclax plus intense chemotherapy represent promising efficacy in de novo AML patients with high complete remission rates and good tolerance. Our preliminary results suggest that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine and CAG are well tolerated and effective for patients who were diagnosed with refreactory/relapse AML. Thus, this phase II clinical trial is going to further explore its efficacy and safety. It is expected that about 42 patients will take part in this trial.
