Safety and Efficacy of ATIR101 as Adjunctive Treatment to Blood Stem Cell Transplantation From a Haploidentical Family Donor Compared to Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Blood Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of a haploidentical T-cell depleted HSCT and adjunctive treatment with ATIR101 versus a haploidentical T cell replete HSCT with post-transplant administration of high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with a hematologic malignancy. An additional objective of the study is to compare the effect of the two treatments on quality of life.

Graft-versus-host Disease-free, Relapse-free Survival (GRFS), Defined as the time until acute GVHD grade III/IV, chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first. Kaplan-Meier estimates (percentage of participants) of GRFS were calculated at 24 months post HSCT., 24 months post-HSCT
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from HSCT until death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier estimates (percentage of participants) of OS were calculated at 24 months post HSCT., 24 months post-HSCT|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from HSCT until relapse, disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first. Kaplan-Meier estimates (percentage of participants) of PFS were calculated at 24 months post HSCT., 24 months post-HSCT|Relapse-related Mortality (RRM), Time from randomization to death due to disease relapse or disease progression, Through study completion, at least two years post HSCT|Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), Defined as death due to causes other than disease relapse or progression, or other causes which are unrelated to the transplantation procedure (e.g. accident, suicide). Kaplan-Meier estimates (percentage of participants) of PFS were calculated at 24 months post HSCT., 24 months post-HSCT

Study CR-AIR-009 is a Phase III randomized controlled multicenter open-label study comparing two parallel groups. After signing informed consent, a total of 250 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; CD34 selection) from a related, haploidentical donor, followed by ATIR101 infusion, or a T-cell replete HSCT, followed by a high dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

Randomization will use minimization to balance treatment groups with respect to underlying disease (AML, ALL, or MDS), Disease Risk Index (DRI; intermediate risk, high risk, or very high risk) and center. A stochastic treatment allocation procedure will be used so that the treatment assignment is random for all patients entered in the study.

Patients randomized in the ATIR101 group will receive a single ATIR101 dose of 2×10E6 viable T-cells/kg between 28 and 32 days after the HSCT. Patients randomized in the PTCy group will receive cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day at 3 and 4/5 days after the HSCT. All patients will be followed up for at least 24 months post HSCT.
