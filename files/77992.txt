APRiCOT-B: Study to Evaluate Apricoxib in Combination With Lapatinib and Capecitabine in the Treatment of HER2/Neu+ Breast Cancer (TP2001-202)
This study will compare the anti-tumor efficacy of apricoxib and lapatinib/capecitabine with placebo and lapatinib/capecitabine as measured by time to disease progression and evaluate urinary PGE-M measurements or baseline COX-2 expression in tumor tissue by IHC as a surrogate selection criterion for patients who will benefit from future treatment with apricoxib.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: apricoxib + lapatinib + capecitabine|DRUG: placebo + lapatinib + capecitabine
To determine the anti-tumor activity of the combination of apricoxib/lapatinib-capecitabine compared with placebo/lapatinib-capecitabine as measured by time to disease progression., Time to disease progression
Progression-free survival and safety/tolerability, Time to disease progression
This study will compare the anti-tumor efficacy of apricoxib and lapatinib/capecitabine with placebo and lapatinib/capecitabine as measured by time to disease progression and evaluate urinary PGE-M measurements or baseline COX-2 expression in tumor tissue by IHC as a surrogate selection criterion for patients who will benefit from future treatment with apricoxib.
