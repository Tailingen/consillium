Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastrointestinal Neoplasms
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a newly developed technique in the field of endoscopic treatment for GI neoplasms, because of its high rate of en bloc resection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for GI neoplasms.
Digestive System Diseases
BEHAVIORAL: endoscopic submucosal dissection
The lesion result before ESD, Including the location, morphology and size under endoscopy and narrow banding image of lesion., within 7 days before ESD|Short-term result after ESD, Including en bloc and curative resection rate, the specimen size, complications, lateral and vertical margin exposure of tumor, and lymphatic or vascular invasion., whithin 7 days after ESD
The safety of ESD procedure, including the endoscopic examination at 3months, 6months, 1year, 2years, 3years, 4years and 5years after ESD, 3months, 6months, 1year, 2years, 3years, 4years and 5years after ESD
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is widely accepted as a minimally invasive treatment for GI neoplasms.However, one disadvantage of EMR is that lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter must be removed in pieces, which may result in a high recurrence rate of residual tumor tissue. In addition, in most patients, pathological assessment cannot be conducted after the procedure. ESD can overcome the disadvantages of EMR. However, it is difficult to perform ESD for GI neoplasms because of the high rate of complications.
