A Study of Pemetrexed in Children With Recurrent Cancer
To determine the response rate of pemetrexed given every 21 days for the treatment of children with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/supratentorial PNET or non-brain stem high-grade glioma.
Osteosarcoma|Medulloblastoma|Sarcoma, Ewing's|Neuroblastoma (Measurable Disease)|Neuroblastoma (Metaiodobenzylguanidine|Positive Evaluable)|Rhabdomyosarcoma|Ependymoma|Non-brainstem High-grade Glioma
DRUG: pemetrexed
Percentage of Participants With Overall Tumor Response (Response Rate), Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response = disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response = 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Response rate (percent \[%\])= (number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in stratum/number of participants in stratum)\*100., baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 1 year)
Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Discontinuations, or Deaths Possibly Due to Study Drug, AdEERS= Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System; AE = adverse event. Patients may be counted in more than 1 category. Includes events that were considered possibly related to study drug (PRSD) as judged by the investigator., every cycle (up to 2 years and 7 months)|Pharmacogenomics - Measure the Response of Genes Related to Toxicity, The pharmacogenomics outcomes examining the correlation between the presence of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene and the presence of a polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene and/or gene promoter and toxicity were optional and will not be reported here. Results of this optional research may be reported in the future by the Children's Oncology Group in the peer-reviewed literature., baseline
