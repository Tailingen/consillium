QoLiCOL - Quality of Life in Colon Cancer
All patients presenting at participating hospitals during the recruitment period with a newly diagnosed colon cancer, regardless of stage and planned treatment, will be eligible for inclusion. They will answer a questionnaire on health related quality of life, physical symptoms, functional impairments and socioeconomic status at diagnosis and after 12, 36 months. Clinical data including recurrence, survival, surgical treatment, oncologic result (pathology report) and adjuvant treatment will be collected from the Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR)

QoLiCOL is an explorative, prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional, international, multicenter study of health-related quality of life, physical symptoms, functional impairments and socioeconomic burden in colon cancer patients. All patients presenting at participating hospitals during the recruitment period with a newly diagnosed rectal cancer, regardless of stage and planned treatment, will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will be followed for 3 years. They will be asked to answer questionnaires at three different time points during follow-up: at diagnosis and after 12 and 36 months. Clinical data, including recurrence, surgical treatment, oncologic result (pathology report) and adjuvant treatment will be collected from the national quality registry for rectal cancer in Denmark and Sweden. As these registries differ in some areas between the countries, additional data will be collected through short CRF:s.
