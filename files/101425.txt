A Trial Of PF-04856884 In Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a protein in the body which destabilizes blood vessels and is important in stimulating tumor blood vessels. There is evidence suggesting that Ang-2 may be important for the growth and progression of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PF- 04856884 (CVX-060) is a compound which binds Ang-2 and prevents its activity. The hypothesis is that PF-04856884 will be safe and effective in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Progression free survival rate at Month 6 (PFS6) defined as the patient progression free status at Month 6., 1 year
Corticosteroid doses at baseline and on-study, 4 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), 2 years|PFS defined as the time from 1st dose of study drug to the 1st documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 2 years|Time to death is defined as the time from first study drug to death due to any cause., 2 years|Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from first dose of study drug to death due to any cause., 2 years|OS6 defined as the patient survival status at Month 6. The OS6 rate will be obtained as a Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to death at Month 6., 2 years|Immunogenicity determined by measuring anti-PF-04856884 antibodies following therapy, 4 months|Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging [DCE-MRI] endpoints to include changes from baseline volume transfer coefficient [Ktrans] and/or the initial area under the contrast agent concentration-time curve [IAUC] or Ki following therapy, 4 months
