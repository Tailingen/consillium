Endoscopic Drainage of Collections After Pancreatic Surgery
The pancreatic surgery causing some pancreatic collections. And in a number of case, this surgery can require a surgical resumption, a percutaneous drainage or an endoscopic drainage.

The endoscopic care of the treatment of pancreatic collections post-surgery is not yet standardized.

After failure of the medical treatment, the drainage of collections by echo-endoscopy was described.

There are not much series on this specific subject. Only 2 series contain more than 20 patients with 31 patients for the most important.

The timing and the technical choice of the endoscopic treatment as well as the long-term follow-up are not clear.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the success and the complications of the endoscopic drainage by echo-endoscopy according to the techniques of drainage and the timing of the endoscopic treatment.

The not estimated long-term follow-up will be also considered.
