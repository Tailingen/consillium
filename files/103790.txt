Physical Activity in Relation to Surgical Procedures
This study will compare the outcome after surgery between a group of patients that receives instructions for prehabilitation training and one group that received standard treatment.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether a training program with intensified physical activity prior to and after a surgical procedure reduces the surgical-related postoperative recovery time, hospital stay, sick leave and complication rate.

A secondary aim is to investigate the effect of a training program with pre- and post- operative PA on the rate of resumption of QoL and normal physical function.
