A New Supplement for the Immune Response to HPV Infection
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a supplement in which ellagic acid plus annona muricata are combined, may modulate the immune response to high risk HPV infection. Sixty women will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled study, having a histological diagnosis of L-SIL correlated with high rish HPV types infection. Main outcome measure is the activation of onco suppressor protein by the supplement and secondary outcome is the clearance of HPV infection in the treated group.
HPV Infection
DRUG: ellagic acid + annona muricata
variation of onco suppressor protein expression from basal values. The expression variations are represented by the different percentage of positive cells, 6 months
clearance of the HPV infection, 6 months
