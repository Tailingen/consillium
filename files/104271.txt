Safety and Efficacy of ALLO-715 BCMA Allogenic CAR T Cells in in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (UNIVERSAL)
The purpose of the UNIVERSAL study is to assess the safety, efficacy, cell kinetics, and immunogenicity of ALLO-715 with or without Nirogacestat in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after a lymphodepletion regimen of ALLO-647 in combination with fludarabine and/or cyclophosphamide, or ALLO-647 alone.
