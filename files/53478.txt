Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Chinese Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this research project is to assess the feasibility and safety of carbon-ion radiotherapy for the treatment of localized Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: carbon-ion radiotherapy for tumor away from GI|RADIATION: carbon-ion radiotherapy for tumor adjacent to GI
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Time interval from the start of CIRT to 3 months after the completion of CIRT
Overall survival of all patients, Overall survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of localized hepatocellular carcinoma, a median of 2 years|Progression-free survival of all patients, Progression-free survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of localized hepatocellular carcinoma, a median of 2 years|Number of participants with tumor response as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Number of participants with tumor response as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Time interval from the start of CIRT to 3 months after the completion of CIRT
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of localized Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with respective to toxicity and tumor control. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens based on the tumor location to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 3 months after the completion of CIRT. Primary endpoint is toxicity, second endpoint is progression-free survival, overall survival and tumor response.
