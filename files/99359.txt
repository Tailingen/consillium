Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy IV Carboplatin With Weekly Paclitaxel \Bevacizumab for Primary Ovarian
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous weekly paclitaxel given with intravenous carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma that are to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (prior to surgical cytoreduction). Patients will then undergo surgery which will allow an objective measure of response to the above regimen as well as assessment of surgical outcomes.
Ovarian Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Tolerated Dose, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of carboplatin AUC5 administered Day 1 Cycles 1-4, weekly paclitaxel 60-80mg/m2 administered on Day 1, 8,and 15 for 3 weeks cycles 1-4, bevacizumab 15mg/kg administered Day 1 Cycles 1-3 prior to surgical intervention., Up to 6 months
Toxicity and Response Rates Based on Imaging and Surgical Outcomes, Determine the safety/toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. Estimate the percent of patients undergoing successful cytoreductive surgery to optimal disease (\<1 cm greatest tumor diameter) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer. Assess the 30 day morbidity and mortality following surgical intervention. To describe the response rate for patients treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, weekly paclitaxel, and bevacizumab using RECIST and GCIG response criteria prior to surgical intervention. Response was determined per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 6 months
Phase I study proposed to evaluate:

* Tolerability of IV regimen carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab in the neoadjuvant setting prior to surgery.
* Safety/Toxicity of IV regimen in this patient population
* Treatment is Carboplatin area under the concentration curve (AUC) 5, Bevacizumab 15mg/m2, and starting dose of paclitaxel of 60mg/m2 and will be escalated in intervals of 10mg/m2 to a maximum dose of 80mg/m2.
* Patients will receive cycles 1-3 of carboplatin, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel and then cycle 4 will be carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by surgical intervention within 6 weeks of cycle 4.
* Post surgical treatment per physician discretion
