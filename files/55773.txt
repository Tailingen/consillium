Study on the Efficacy and Safety of the TmBU Conditioning Regimen in High-risk or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Leukemia
This project is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled clinical study. The subjects were high-risk or relapsed/refractory AML or ALL patients aged ≤ 65 years diagnosed by bone marrow cell morphology, immunology, genetics and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. The TmBU scheme or modified Bu/Cy (mBuCy) scheme was used for pretreatment in allo-HSCT. The primary endpoint of the study was the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) after allo-HSCT, and the secondary endpoints were 2-year overall survival rate (OS), progressing-free survival rate (PFS), non-relapse mortality rate (NRM), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) rate.

Cumulative incidence of relapse（CIR）, It is measured the date from complete remission after transplantation to hematological relapse or molecular relapse was recorded. Patients who had no relapse at the last follow-up were considered as censored data, and non-relapse death was regarded as a competing risk event., 2 years
Time period for hematopoietic reconstruction, Granulogenetic hematopoietic reconstitution: The absolute neutrophil count in peripheral blood needs to reach or exceed 0.5×10\^9 cells/L for 3 consecutive days. Megakaryotic hematopoietic reconstitution: platelet count needs to be more than 20×10\^9/L and does not rely on platelet transfusion for 7 consecutive days., 24 weeks|Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), 100 days|Progressing-free survival（PFS）, It is measured from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse from CR, or CRi, or death from any cause; patients not known to have any of these events are censored on the date they were last examined., 2 years|Overall survival（OS）, It is measured from the date of entry into this trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., 2 years|Non-relapse mortality（NRM）, It is described as proportion of deaths due to non-primary recurrence from enrollment start date to 2 years post-transplant., 2 years|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free relapse-free survival (GRFS), It is defined as a composite end point of death from any cause, relapse of malignancy, grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, or chronic GVHD requiring systemic immune suppression therapy., 2 years
