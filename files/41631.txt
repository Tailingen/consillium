This questionnaire includes questions on infectious diseases of upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin and urogenital tract contracted during the previous 12 months. Questions investigate on the number and duration of infections, necessity of antibiotic or antifungal therapy, hospital stay and days of absence from work. Final score represents the frequency of infections. Moreover, some questions investigate possible susceptible or protective factors for infectious diseases: vaccinations, use of corticosteroids, concomitant diseases, previous appendectomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, splenectomy or thymectomy., baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Circadian blood pressure, Circadian blood pressure will be evaluated using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring blood pressure waves for a noninvasive estimation, baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Quality of life evaluation, Quality of life will be evaluated by the Physical Component score and the Mental Component score of the self-administered questionnaire SF-36-Item Health Survey questionnaire.

This questionnaire measures eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health (physical component) and vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health (mental component).

Interpretation of the score will be the following: at each item of the questionnaire corresponds a percentage value (from 0% to 100%). The average of the single items constitutes the scale total percentage (from 0% to 100%); missing data are not considered during calculation. High score defines a more favorable health state., baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Psychometric Evaluation, Psychometric Evaluation will be evaluated using Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. : a 21-item measure of depressive symptoms. Each answer is scored on a scale value (from 0 to 3 points). The global score is obtained adding all single scores, with a range of 0-63. Higher score constitutes worse burden of symptoms (0-13: minimal depression, 14-19: mild depression, 20-28: moderate depression, 29-63: severe depression)., baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Sexual dysfunction in women, Evaluation of sexual dysfunction will be evaluated in women using FSFI questionnaire. This is a 19-item questionnaire that covers six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The ranges of the domain scores are as follows: for desire 1.2 - 6.0, for arousal, lubrication, orgasm and pain 0 - 6.0 and for satisfaction 0.8 - 6.0. The higher scores of the six domains indicate better sexual functioning about that domain. The overall FSFI score is obtained by summing the six domain scores. The overall FSFI scores range from 2.0 to 36.0, with higher scores indicating better sexual functioning., baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Sexual dysfunction in men, Evaluation of sexual dysfunction will be evaluated in men using IIEF questionnaire. The IIEF is an internationally validated test. It is used to assign a score of erectile dysfunction: severe score 1 to 10; moderate score 11 to 16; low to moderate score 17 to 21; Low score 22 to 25; no erectile dysfunction score 26 to 30, baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|insuline resistance, Measurement of HOMA index calculated according to the formula: fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5., baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|blood lipid profile, Measurement of Total Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, Triglyceredes, baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months|Inflammatory cytokines levels, Evaluation of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β), Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), Leptin, Resistin, Adiponectin, Adipsin, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Serpin, C Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 10 (IL-10) serum concentrations at 7:00-8:00 AM (before breakfast), 12:00 AM (before lunch), 3:00-4:00 PM (after lunch), 7:00 PM (before dinner), 12:00 PM, baseline, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months
This is an intervention, prospective, multicentric study.

Enrolled patients will undergo 4 visits:

* Adrenal insufficiency (AI) patients: patients affected by primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, whether newly diagnosed or on established glucocorticoid therapy, will be evaluated at baseline and after one, three and six months.
* Cushing's Syndrome (CS) patients: patients affected by Cushing's Syndrome will be evaluated at baseline during active phase of the disease and one, three and six months after treatment or remission. Patients affected by Cushing's Syndrome who will require glucocorticoid replacement therapy after remission will be evaluated three and six months after remission and then three and six months after the eventual glucocorticoid replacement therapy withdrawal. CS treatment will be surgery or medical therapy according to guidelines. Timing of medical therapy administration will change during protocol according to circadian rhythms.
