A Study of AMG 193 in Participants With Advanced MTAP-null Solid Tumors (MTAPESTRY 101)
The primary objective of Parts 1 and 2 of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG 193 alone and in combination with docetaxel in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-null solid tumors.

The primary objective of Part 3 of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 193 in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced MTAP-null solid tumors.
Advanced MTAP-null Solid Tumors
DRUG: AMG 193|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Comparator AMG 193 Test Tablet
Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), 28 days|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants Who Experience a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs are any event that occurs after the participant has received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory tests will be recorded as TEAEs.

Serious AEs (SAEs) are defined as any event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:

* Results in death (fatal)
* Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
* Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
* Other medically important serious event, Up to approximately 2 years|Part 3: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Up to approximately 2 years

TEAEs are any event that occurs after the participant has received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests will be recorded as TEAEs.

SAEs are defined as any event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
