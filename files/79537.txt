Respiration Gated Laser Guided CT Lung Nodule Biopsy
The primary outcome of this study is to investigate the accuracy of respiration gated laser guided CT lung nodule biopsy through a prospective randomized trial using a bellows-based breath hold monitoring system. Secondary outcome is the rate of complications using laser guided CT biopsy in general and with bellows-based breath hold monitoring system. The study has approval from the The Danish National Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (ref no: H-4-2010-fsp 1).
