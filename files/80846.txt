DNA Repair Activity in the Skin of Day and Night Shift Workers
The purpose of this study is to test how the skin of night shift workers responds to artificial sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation; UVB) at two different times of the day in comparison to normal day shift workers. After the skin biopsies are obtained, they will be brought to the laboratory to be exposed to UVB radiation and to measure UVB responses.
Skin Cancer
RADIATION: Ultraviolet B Radiation|OTHER: No Ultraviolet B Radiation
Expression level of the DNA repair factor XPA at two times of the day in the skin of day and night shift workers., Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry will be used to measure XPA expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively, in skin samples obtained at 8 am and 4 pm., After 1 hour incubation from ultraviolet B radiation exposure.|Expression levels of core clock genes at two times of the day in the skin of day and night shift works., Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is used to measure the core circadian clock gene expression at the mRNA level in the skin samples obtained at 8 AM and 4 PM., After 1 hour incubation from ultraviolet B radiation exposure.|Activity of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system at two times of the day in day and night shift workers., A biochemical assay of nucleotide excision repair is used to measure NER in the skin samples obtained at 8 AM and 4 PM., After 1 hour incubation from ultraviolet B radiation exposure.|Activation of DNA damage kinase signaling pathways at two times of the day in the skin of day and night shift workers., Immunohistochemistry is used to measure DNA damage kinase signaling (phosphorylated Chk1 and p53) in the skin samples obtained at 8 AM and 4 PM., After 1 hour incubation from ultraviolet B radiation exposure.
