MEGA (Met or EGFR Inhibition in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma): FOLFOX Alone or in Combination With AMG 102 or Panitumumab as First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
This multicentre, open-label, randomized phase II trial is ongoing in 30 centres in France. Main eligibility criteria include: histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagus or gastroesophageal junction; locally advanced or metastatic disease; measurable disease (RECIST 1.1); no known HER2 overexpression; no prior palliative chemotherapy.
Malignant Neoplasm of Esophagus|Malignant Neoplasm of Stomach
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Folinic Acid|DRUG: 5-fluoro-uracil|DRUG: panitumumab|DRUG: AMG102
Progression-free survival at 4 months, based on the proportion of success in each patient group (patient without progression at 4 months), 4 months
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to progression (RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last tumoral evaluation and 5 years maximum., until progression or death|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death any cause or last follow-up news (censored data)., until death|Time to progression, Time to progression is defined as the time from randomization to progression (RECIST v1.1 criteria). Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last tumoral evaluation. Patients died without progression will be censored at the death date any cause., 4 months|Objective tumor response rate (OR) (= complete responses [CR] + partial responses [PR]) according to RECIST V1.1, The objective tumor response will be evaluated by the investigator with RECIST v1.1 criteria every 8 (± 1) weeks up to disease progression. Patients with symptoms suggestive of disease progression will have a tumoral evaluation when symptoms will occur., until progression|Objective response duration, The Objective response duration is defined as time from first Complete Response or Partial Response to progression. Patients died without progression will be censored at death date., until progression|Disease control rate (Complete Response + Partial Response + stable disease [SD]), The tumor control rate is rate of objective responses (complete responses and partial responses) and stable disease responses., 4 months|Tolerance of the treatment, Tolerability of the treatment will be based on toxicities of evaluated products by clinical and biological measurements (NCIC/CTC (CTCAE V4) criteria, except for peripheral neuropathy toxicity (Lévi scale))., 24 months
Patients are randomised to modified FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, FA 400 mg/m², FU 400 mg/m² bolus then 2400 mg/m² over 46 hr) alone or combined to either panitumumab (6 mg/kg) or AMG 102 (10 mg/kg), every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Judgment criteria include 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (primary endpoint), OS, objective response rate, and safety. Ancillary studies aim to identify candidate predictive and prognostic biomarkers among functional of molecular alterations of the EGFR/RAS/RAF and HGF/c-Met pathways, and to monitor circulating tumour cells and circulating immune cells (myeloid derived suppressor cells, NK cells) in sequential blood samples taken at baseline and through the study treatment. A total of 165 pts will be enrolled (Fleming's one-step design)
