The purpose of this clinical study is to examine the safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity of the immunotherapeutic product GSK2302025A (also referred to as recPRAME + AS15 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic \[ASCI\]) administered as a first line treatment in patients with unresectable and progressive metastatic cutaneous melanoma.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Immunotherapeutic GSK2302025A, different formulations
Number of Patients With Dose-limiting Toxicity (Phase I), The dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were defined as follows: •An Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) related or possibly ASCI related grade 3 or higher toxicity. Grade 3 myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fever, rigors/chills and fatigue (including lethargy, malaise and asthenia) persisting for 48 hours despite therapy. •An ASCI related or possibly ASCI related grade 2 or higher allergic reaction occurring within 24 hours following the ASCI administration. •An ASCI related or possibly ASCI related decrease in renal function, with a creatinine clearance lower than (\<) 40 milliliters per minute (mL/min). •An ASCI-related or possibly ASCI-related symptomatic and confirmed adrenal insufficiency. The grading used was defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0: Grade 3 DLT = severe DLT. Related = DLT considered by investigator as possibly related to product administration., During the study treatment (up to Year 4), for all patients|Percentage of Patients With Anti-PReferentially Expressed Antigen of MElanoma (Anti-PRAME) Humoral Immune Response (Phase I), A seronegative/seropositive patient for anti-PRAME antibodies was a patient with antibody concentration lower (\<)/ higher than or equal to (≥) cut-off level. Humoral immune response was defined as a) if baseline concentration \< cut-off level: post treatment concentration ≥ cut-off level, or b) if baseline concentration ≥ cut-off level: post treatment concentration at least twice the baseline value. Cut-off values for seropositivity (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \[ELISA\]) were 12 ELISA Units per milliliter (EL.U/mL)., After the administration of dose 4, at Week 8|Number of Patients With Best Overall Response to Study Treatment (Phase II), The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general the patient's best response assignment depended on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. The best overall response includes the complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all targeted/non-targeted lesions and partial response (PR) defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD and persistence of one or more non-targeted lesion(s)., During the entire study period - up to Year 4 + 1 month post last study treatment administration

Considering that 2 studies failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy of recombinant protein based cancer vaccines, GSK decided in 2014 to stop the development and to stop recruitment in all the ongoing clinical studies. The decision was made to end the study (i.e., stopping patient enrollment, follow-ups, sample collection and analysis of samples for research purposes). Patients still on treatment at the time of the protocol amendment were offered to continue the administration of the study treatment until the last dose or until recurrence, whichever came first, or until the patient or the investigator decided to stop the study treatment. No further active protocol visit/contact was performed except for the concluding visit at Week 199, 30 days after the last treatment administration., Up to Data Lock Point at Week 8|Number of Patients With Anti-PRAME Humoral Immune Response (Phase I & II), A seropositive patient was a patient whose anti-PRAME antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the assay cut-off value of 12 ELISA units per milliliter (EL.U/mL). A seronegative patient was defined as a patient whose pre-treatment antibody concentration was below (\<) the cut-off value. An anti-PRAME antibody responder was defined as: For a seronegative patient: a post-treatment antibody concentration ≥ the cut-off value; For a seropositive patient: a post-treatment antibody concentration ≥ twice the pre-treatment antibody concentration., At Weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 29, 51, 75, 99, 123, 147 and conclusion visit at 30 days post last treatment administration (Week 199) for each patient|Number of Patients With Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), Mixed Response (MR) (Phase I & II), Tumor response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), where stable disease for target lesions refers to neither enough shrinkage to qualify for complete response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter (LD) since the treatment started. For non-targeted lesions it refers to persistence of one or more non-target lesions. Progressive disease is related to a clear increase of diameters of lesions taking as references the smallest diameters recorded since the treatment started OR the appearance of one or more new lesions OR both of these., At 30 days after the last treatment administration for each patient (Week 199)|Number of Patients With Best Overall Response, Including Mixed Response (MxR) and Slow Progressive Disease (SPD) Criteria (Phase I & II), Tumor response was assessed by the RECIST criteria, where SD for target lesions refers to neither enough shrinkage to qualify for CR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter (LD) since the treatment started. For non-targeted lesions it refers to persistence of one or more nom-target lesions. Progressive disease is related to a clear increase of diameters of lesions taking as references the smallest diameters recorded since the treatment started OR the appearance of one or more new lesions OR both of these. Mixed response is defined as at least 30% decrease in the LD occurring in at least one target lesion recorded and measured at baseline. Such response occurring in otherwise SD or PD status of the LD of target lesions were classified as "SD with target lesion regression" or "PD with target lesion regression", respectively. New lesion(s) in otherwise PR status of the LD of target lesions were "PR with new lesion"., At 30 days after the last treatment administration for each patient (Week 199)|Anti-Protein D Humoral Response (Phase I & II), Analysis of immunogenicity for anti-PD antibodies was not performed, following negative results to the NCT00480025 study which assessed another study product from same technology platform. For this study, the main analysis of the dose-escalation Phase I segment was performed according to protocol when all patients enrolled in the Phase I segment had received the first 4 treatment doses and had completed Week 8. The main analysis of the Phase II segment was performed according to protocol when all patients had either completed the treatment until the end of Cycle 3 or had been withdrawn from the study treatment, with the exception of anti-PD antibody responses and PRAME-specific cellular responses which were not yet performed. All samples that had been collected but not yet tested were not tested by default, except if a scientific rationale remained relevant., At Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 29, 51, 75, 99, 123, 147, 30 days after the last treatment administration for each patient (Week 199), with follow-up, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after concluding visit|Anti-Cytosine Phosphate Guanosine Oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) Humoral Response (Phase I & II), Analysis of immunogenicity for anti-CpG antibodies was not performed, following negative results to the NCT00480025 study which assessed another study product from same technology platform.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first adminsitration of study product until the date of either disease progression or death (for whatever reason), whichever comes first. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first administration of study product until death., Up to concluding visit, at Week 199|Duration of Response for Patients With CR, PR and SD or SD/PR Status (Phase II), This analysis was not performed following negative results to the NCT00480025 study which assessed another study product from same technology platform. For this study, the main analysis of the dose-escalation Phase I segment was performed according to protocol when all patients enrolled in the Phase I segment had received the first 4 treatment doses and had completed Week 8. The main analysis of the Phase II segment was performed according to protocol when all patients had either completed the treatment until the end of Cycle 3 or had been withdrawn from the study treatment, with the exception of anti-CpG/anti-PD antibody responses and PRAME-specific cellular responses which were not yet performed. All samples that had been collected but not yet tested were not tested by default, except if a scientific rationale remained relevant., Up to concluding visit, at Week 199
In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of recMAGE-A3 + AS15 according to four cycles over a period of four years. An active follow-phase (up to five years after registration into the study) was planned for all patients.

This protocol summary has been impacted by protocol amendment 3, so there will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion of the study treatment. The study will end approximately 30 days after the last dose will be administered.

In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.

Sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.
