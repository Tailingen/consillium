Outcomes of First-line Olaparib Mono-maintenance therapy-a Multicenter, Retrospective Study Using Data From Real-world Clinical Setting
Four phase III trials in ovarian cancer consistently showed that front-line poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition can significantly improve progression-free survival. Based on these findings, current clinical guidelines recommend the olaparib + bevacizumab combination as a maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 wild-type or unknown mutation status who have a complete response (CR)/ partial response (PR) after completing bevacizumab-containing first-line therapy. However, bevacizumab is not a NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINSTRATION（NMPA）-approved agent for ovarian cancer patients. In this setting, olaparib mono-maintenance therapy has been implemented among patients with BRCA-wild type tumors in clinical practice in China.
Ovarian Neoplasms
DRUG: Olaparib mono-maintenance therapy
1-yr PFS rate, The main objective is to evaluate the outcome of olaparib-based maintenance therapy by proportion of patients alive and progression free at 1 year., 12 months after date of first dose
2-yr PFS rate, The proportion of patients alive and progression free by 2 years by investigator assessed clinical progression, 24 months after date of first dose|Median PFS, Median time from date of first dose until disease progression per clinical progression (mPFS) as assessed by the investigator at local site or death due to any cause (if this occurs before disease progression), Median time from date of first dose until disease progression|mTFST, Median Time to First Subsequent Therapy or death, Median time from date of first dose to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy after discontinuation of treatment or death due to any cause|post-progression treatment after first progression, The proportion of patients receiving each treatment after first progression, The proportion of patients receiving each treatment after first progression|Reason for olaparib dose adjustment, dose interruptions, and dose discontinuations, The proportion of olaparib dose adjustment, dose interruptions, and dose discontinuations, The proportion of olaparib dose adjustment, dose interruptions, and dose discontinuations|Reason for use of concomitant therapy, The proportion of concomitant therapy, The proportion of concomitant therapy
The main objective is to evaluate the outcome of olaparib-based maintenance therapy by proportion of patients alive and progression free at 1 year (1-yr PFS rate) We hypothesize that olaparib monotherapy could be beneficial for tBRCAwt high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients who are treated with platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the outcomes of olaparib-based maintenance therapy by: 1) 2-yr PFS rate; 2) median PFS; 3) median Time to First Subsequent Therapy or death (mTFST) ; 4) post-progression treatment after first progression; 5) reason for olaparib dose adjustment, dose interruptions, and dose discontinuations; 6) Reason for use of concomitant therapy.

The exploratory objective is to evaluate the status quo of genetic testing, R0 resection and related outcomes.
