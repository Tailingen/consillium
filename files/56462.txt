Phase II Single Arm Study of AZD9291 to Treat NSCLC Patients in Asia Pacific
A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of AZD9291 in Asia Pacific Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AZD9291
ORR According to RECIST 1.1 by Independent Review, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (according to independent review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., At baseline and every 6 weeks from time of first dose until objective disease progression,up to 24 months after Last Patient First Dose(LPFD)
DoR According to RECIST 1.1 by Independent Review, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed) until the date of documented progression (PD) or death in the absence of disease progression (by investigator assessment)., At baseline and every 6 weeks from time first dose until date of progression, up to 24 months after LPFD.|DCR According to RECIST 1.1 by Independent Review, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or SD (according to independent review), prior to progression (PD) or further anti-cancer therapy., At baseline and every 6 weeks from time first dose until date of progression, up to 24 months after Last Patient First Dose(LPFD)|Tumour Shrinkage According to RECIST 1.1 by Independent Review, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Tumour size was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the Target Lesions. Tumour shrinkage is the best percentage change in tumour size from baseline using RECIST v1.1 tumour response., At baseline and every 6 weeks from time of first dose until date of progression, up to 24 months after LPFD.|PFS According to RECIST 1.1 by Independent Review, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. PFS is the time from date of first dose until the date of PD (by independent review) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from AZD9291 therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment., At baseline and every 6 weeks from time of first dose until objective disease progression, up to 24 months after LPFD.|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from first dose until death from any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive., From first dose to end of study or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed every 6 weeks up to approximately 95 OS events (about 55% maturity) have been observed out of all enrolled patients.
This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in Asia Pacific patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) sensitising mutation positive (ie, G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q) and T790M mutation positive (hereafter referred to as EGFRm+ and T790M+) un-resectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB-IV), who have progressed on an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), either as first line treatment or following one line of EGFR-TKI and one line of platinum containing doublet chemotherapy. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
