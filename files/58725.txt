Effect of Stellate Ganglion Block on Meniere's Disease
Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has been the alternative treatment of Meniere's disease for years. However, objective evidence of the effect of SGB was still lack. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled study to examine the immediate effects of SGB in SP/AP of electrocochleography (ECoG).
Vertigo|Meniere Disease
PROCEDURE: stellate ganglion block|DRUG: 0.25mg, fludiazine|DRUG: 25mg cephadol@ (diphenidol)|DRUG: 200mg kentons@ (tocopherol nicotinate).
SP/AP of Electrocochleography, SP/AP of ECoG was recorded 2 hours after SGB. to be compared with the SP/AP of ECoG recorded before treatment, ECoG was reorded 2 hours after SGB
SP/AP recorded at 4 hours after SGB, SP/AP recorded at 4 hours after SGB was compared with that of pretreatment with SGB, 4 hours after SGB|SP/AP recorded at 6 hours after SGB, SP/AP recorded at 4 hours after SGB was compared with the SP/AP recorded before SGB, 6 hours after SGB|scores of verbal scale for vertigo recorded at 6 hours after SGB, scores of verbal scale for vertigo recorded at 6 hours after SGB was compared to the scores recorded before SGB, 6 hours after SGB
Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive stellate ganglion block. These ten patients made up the experimental group. Another ten patients in the control group were assigned to receiving one dosage of oral medications: 0.25mg of erispan@ (fludiazine) , 25mg cephadol@ (diphenidol), and 200mg kentons@ (tocopherol nicotinate).
