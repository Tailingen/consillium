Study of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Combined to Chemotherapy in Older Patients With Philadelphia Chromosome-negative CD22+ B-cell Precursor ALL
The aim of the present EWALL-INO study is to confirm very promising results obtained with a combination of INO and mild chemotherapy in older de novo CD22+ B-ALL patients. For that purpose, safety and efficacy of a weekly INO administration combined to mild-intensity chemotherapy will be evaluated in a cohort of patients aged more than 55 years with newly diagnosed previously untreated Ph-negative (CD22+) BCP-ALL. Conversely to the MDACC miniHCVD-INO study and in order to lower the overall toxicity of the combination, INO will be given as part of the remission induction treatment phase during the first 2 treatment cycles only, in combination with corticosteroid, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and intrathecal prophylaxis only; then, all responding patients will received standard INO-free chemotherapy as consolidation and maintenance.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph)-Negative CD22+ B-cell Precursor (BCP)
DRUG: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO)
Assessment of overall survival (OS), The primary objective of the trial is to assess overall survival (OS) observed at 1 year after administration of INO and chemotherapy in older Ph-negative BCP-ALL patients., one year
Assessment of adverse events (AEs), Type, duration and frequency of AEs up to 3 months of induction course 1 or 2, 3 months|Rate of complete remission (CR / CRp), CR/CRp response rate after INO-based induction course 1 and 2, 35 days|Assessment of Minimal residual disease (MRD), Flow cytometry and Ig-TCR MRD levels, after INO-based induction course 1 and 2 and impact on outcomes, 35 days|Rate of early death, Early death (ED) rate at 30, 60 and 100 day from treatment initiation, 100 days|Composite measure for Duration of response (DOR), Disease-free survival (DFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), Duration of response (DOR), Disease-free survival (DFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), one year
INO schedule of administration will be as described in the refractory/relapsed INO-VATE study for the first cycle, with sequential day 1/8/15 doses of 0.8, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/m2, respectively. Reduced dose of INO will be used for the second and last cycle (0.5 mg/m2 on day 1/8). This was retained in order:

1. to minimize potential toxicities, including liver disorders and prolonged thrombocytopenia; and
2. to allow delivery of subsequent chemotherapy consolidations cycles.
