SHP2 Inhibitor BBP-398 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With a KRAS Mutation
This is a Phase 1 study of BBP-398, a SHP2 inhibitor, in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 antibody, in patients with NSCLC with a KRAS mutation. The study involves 2 parts: Phase 1a Dose Escalation and Phase 1b Dose Expansion.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: BBP-398 with nivolumab
Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Assess safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BBP-398 in combination with nivolumab, Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Assess antitumor activity of BBP-398 in combination with nivolumab, Anti-tumor activity will be defined by objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1, Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)
Assess preliminary antitumor activity of BBP-398 in combination with nivolumab, Anti-tumor activity will be defined by objective response rate (ORR) \[escalation\], duration of response (DOR) and progression free survival (PFS), as defined by RECIST v1.1. and overall survival (OS) \[both escalation and expansion\], Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Assess safety and tolerability of BBP-398 at the RP2D, in combination with nivolumab, Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)
The primary objective for Phase 1a Dose Escalation is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of BBP-398, a SHP2 inhibitor, when used in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC with a KRAS mutation who have failed standard of care treatment.

The primary objective for Phase 1b Dose Expansion is to evaluate the antitumor activity of BBP-398, as defined by the ORR (per investigator) according to RECIST v1.1, when used in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC with a KRAS mutation who have failed standard of care treatment.
