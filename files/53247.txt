Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab With Chemoradiation for the Treatment of Locally Recurrent and Oligometastatic Cervical Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluation the efficacy and safety of iparomlimab and tuvonralimab, paclitaxel + cisplatin/carboplatin combined with radiotherapy of locally recurrent and oligometastatic cervical cancer.The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does the combination therapy improve the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and safety in participants?
2. What are the predictive biomarkers of treatment efficacy, and how can this information better guide the use of immune-oncology drugs in combination therapy?

Participants will:

* Receive iparomlimab and tuvonralimab, Paclitaxel + Cisplatin/Carboplatin and radiation therapy according to a specified protocol.
* Visit the clinic for regular checkups and tests throughout the treatment period.
* Be monitored for and have records kept of ORR, PFS, DCR, OS, and safety.
* Provide hematologic、tissue and stool samples to explore biomarkers.

This study will help determine if this combination therapy can become a new standard of care for patients with locally recurrent and oligometastatic cervical cancer as well as identify biomarkers to better guide treatment strategies.

Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be assessed from the date of enrollment until the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be assessed from the date of enrollment until the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months
Objective Response Rate, ORR refers to the proportion of patients whose optimal response is complete or partial response, Assessed every 6 weeks via imaging until study completion (up to 24 months|Overall Survival, The time interval from enrollment to death from any cause, The time interval from enrollment to death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Disease Control Rate, DCR refers to the proportion of patients whose optimal response is complete or partial response, or stable disease, Assessed every 6 weeks via imaging until study completion (up to 24 months）|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Number of participants with adverse events and severe as assessed by CTCAE v5., Before each chemotherapy cycle (each cycle is 21 days), at 24 hours pre- and post-radiotherapy, and every 3 months during follow-up (up to 24 months)
