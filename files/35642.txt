Vorinostat in Combination With Chemotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors and CNS Malignancies
Investigators are testing new experimental drug combinations such as the combination of vorinostat, vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide in the hopes of finding a drug that may be effective against tumors that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy.

The goals of this study are:

* To find the highest safe dose of vorinostat that can be given together with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide without causing severe side effects;
* To learn what kind of side effects this four drug combination can cause;
* To learn about the effects of vorinostat and the combination of vorinostat, vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide on specific molecules in tumor cells;
* To determine whether the combination of vorinosat, vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide is a beneficial treatment.

DRUG: Vorinostat
To determine a maximally tolerated (or optimal) dose of vorinostat, A minimum of 3 evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level. If no significant dose limiting toxicity is discovered, a maximum of 3 dose levels will be evaluated. The minimum patient enrollment will be 3 patients. Many of the patients enrolled on this trial are expected to be heavily pretreated. All patients will be given a VIT only "window" to evaluate adequate bone marrow reserve to tolerate protocol therapy. We expect that at most 20% of patients will not be able to tolerate VIT or VIT with dose reduced temozolomide. A maximum of 24 patients enrolled on study is anticipated. Once the MTD has been defined, up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled to acquire additional safety data regarding this combination of agents., 1 year
Overall response rate (ORR) after therapy, To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of vorinostat in combination with VIT in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

The overall (CR+PR) and best response rates with the 95% confidence intervals will be estimated based on the exact binomial distribution., 1 year
This first cycle will be used to determine whether the patient can tolerate the chemotherapeutic backbone without developing a DLT. The baseline disease evaluation will be obtained following hematologic recovery from the first cycle of chemotherapy, after which combination therapy with vorinostat will be given in subsequent cycles (2-12) w/ modifications if needed. Vorinostat dose escalation in subsequent patient cohorts will occur based on DLT to determine a MTD.
