Prior to entering the study, all patients will undergo pre-study assessments including compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, laboratory assessments, pelvic examination, and imaging of the pelvis. Following conventional catheter angiography to confirm catheter placement and the uterine vasculature, each patient will undergo transarterial embolization with Occlusin 500 microspheres.
