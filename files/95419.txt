QL1706 Plus Bevacizumab for Unresectable or Metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC
This is a single-arm, multi-center, exploratory study evaluating the efficacy and safety of iparomlimab and tuvonralimab (QL1706) in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. Eligible participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will provide written informed consent and receive QL1706 at 5.0 mg/kg and bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle (Q3W), until disease progression or completion of 2 years of treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints include disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), PFS and OS rates at 6, 12, and 24 months, and safety.
