This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory BCMA/TACI positive relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. 36 patients will be enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
