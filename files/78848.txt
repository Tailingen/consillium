New Ways of Doing Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Children and Adults
This study is being done to see how we can prevent problems caused by movement during the MRI scan. Different ways of doing the scan (techniques) will be tested to see if they are practical and can prevent problems related to motion. For example, changes in the timing of the magnetic field and the radio waves will be examined, and at changes in the way a computer is used to process the images. The new techniques will be compared with the techniques that are usually used.

Compare Image Quality, To assess the new MRI sequences or MRI analysis methods and compare their image quality to current clinical ones. Specifically, we aim to compare the routine sequences with the experimental sequences., Day of MRI
