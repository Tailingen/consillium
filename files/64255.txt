Axitinib Intensification Plus Nivolumab or Nivolumab Alone After Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in mRCC Patients
This phase II open label trial randomized patients who completed the induction with nivolumab plus ipilimumab without complete response or progressive disease will be randomized 1:1 to receive axitinib in addition to nivolumab (Arm A) or continue with nivolumab alone (Arm B).Treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal, or physician decision whichever occurred first.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Efficacy of axitinib in addition to nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone at the end of the induction with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in mRCC., The response rate will be evaluated as the number of patients with complete or partial response in each arm. Response rate will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1 criteria., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first
Progression free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of radiological or clinical progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be reported as the median value and estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, difference between the two arms will be assessed by log-rank test., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first|Overall survival (OS), The OS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. OS will be reported as the median value and estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, difference between the two arms will be assessed by log-rank test., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first|Depth of response., The depth of response is defined as the number of patients who achieved different grades of tumor reduction between the two arms. Difference in the depth of response between will be reported as absolute number and percentage and difference between the two groups will be analyzed., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first|Duration of response (DOR)., The DOR is the length of time that a tumor continues to respond to treatment without the cancer growing or spreading. DOR will be reported as the median value and estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, difference between the two arms will be assessed by log-rank test., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first|Health status and life status, Quality of life will be evaluated by FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires within 3 days prior the first study treatment, the first day of each cycle (1, 3, 5, etc.) of nivolumab prior to treatment administration, at the end of treatment visit., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause|incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Serious adverse events and events of clinical interest, as assessed by the Investigators, This analysis will include all the adverse events occurring from the randomization to 100 days after the last dose of drug. Incidence of adverse events will be reported as absolute number and percentage and difference between the two groups will be analyzed., all the adverse events occurring from the randomization to 100 days after the last dose of drug
expression of PD-L1, PBRM1, CD31 on tumor cells ad CD8+ on lymphocytes, Patients enrolled will be evaluated for the expression in an archival paraffin embedded tumour tissue block for the immunohistochemistry expression of PBRM1, PD-L1, CD31 and immune infiltration CD8+. The expression of these proteins will be related to the main outcomes investigated in the study. Tumor samples will be collected and analyzed at the end of the trial. The analysis will be performed by two expert pathologists in GU tumors at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, Italy., 24 months
The present study aims to demonstrate if the addition of axitinib to nivolumab maintenance after nivolumab plus ipilimumab induction can improve the rate of response considering that the incidence of partial response was 32% and 51% in Checkmate214 and Keynote426 trials respectively.

This study requires 106 patients to show an improvement from 30% to 50% of the incidence of partial responses with a power of 80%, and alpha-error 0.10 (one-side p).

Assuming a drop out of 10%, the final estimated number to enroll should be 118 (59 in arm A and 59 in arm B).
