A Phase I Study of LXP1788 Injection with Advanced Solid Tumors.
A Phase I, open-label, first-in-human study to determine the MTD, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LXP1788 Injection in patients with advanced solid tumor.

Patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to currently available therapies or for whom no effective treatment is available will be selected.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LXP1788 Injection
2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LXP1788 Injection

DRUG: LXP1788 is administered intravenously via Port-A
To determine the MTD and potential phase 2 dose regimen(s) of LXP1788 Injection, 2 years|To characterize the plasma PK profile of LXP1788 following IV administration of LXP1788 Injection, PK blood samples to determine plasma concentrations of LXP1788 will be collected at the time points listed in the schedule of events table. Where possible, the plasma concentration-time data will be used to calculate the following parameters for LXP1788 Injection by non-compartmental methods: Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), dose-normalized Cmax (Cmax/D), area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-24), dose-normalized AUC0-24 (AUC0-24/D), AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last), dose-normalized AUC0-last (AUC0-last/D), AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), dose-normalized AUC0-inf (AUC0-inf/D), time to Cmax (tmax), plasma clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vz), terminal rate constant (Î»z), and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2)., 2 years
To assess the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of LXP1788 Injection, To assess the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of LXP1788 Injection, 2 years|To assess exposure levels to LXP1788, To assess exposure levels to LXP1788, 2 years|To assess anti-tumor activity of LXP1788 Injection, To assess anti-tumor activity of LXP1788 Injection
