Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Patients With Papillary and Mucinous Intracanal Tumours of the Pancreas Papillary and Mucinous Tumours of the Pancreas
This trial is a prospective, exploratory and descriptive study. The primary objective is to identify early diagnostic biomarkers in patients with TIPMP based on the analysis of Treg lymphocyte subpopulations and epigenetic signatures, and the secondary objective is to characterize the biological processes underlying the transformation of a pre-neoplastic lesion into established ADPC.
PAPILLARY AND MUCINOUS INTRACANAL TUMORS OF THE PANCREAS
OTHER: blood sampling at inclusion, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Tumor and intracystic fluid samples are taken only if a biopsy is planned following MRI results.
the aim is to search for immune and metabolic abnormalities in patients with at-risk TIPMP in the blood or by echo-endoscopic sampling, then compare and combine them with the criteria used in clinical practice., Biomarkers will be studied to determine whether those selected have been effective in identifying patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma., for two years
To meet the objectives of the study, patients will have blood samples taken at the time of their TIPMP monitoring, i.e. at inclusion, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. If echo-endoscopy is performed during MRI monitoring of their disease, and a sample is taken as part of the treatment, a tumor sample and an intra-cystic fluid sample will be collected as part of the protocol.
