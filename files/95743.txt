Biodistribution and Dosimetry of Serial PET Imaging With Ga-68 Labeled F(ab') 2- Trastuzumab
The purpose of this study is to learn more about how a new study agent works inside the body. This study agent is a protein called 68Ga-F(ab')2-trastuzumab fragments (HERScan). This is a radioactive tracer that was developed at MSKCC to target the HER2 protein on cancer cells. By giving this tracer to patients whose cancers have the HER2 protein, we hope to be able to see the level of HER2 on the cancer cells using PET scanning.
