Mean Change from Baseline to Visit 2 in CTCAE Grading of Xerosis, The investigator will evaluate subjects for overall xerosis (skin dryness) using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading scale. For xerosis, the scale ranges from 1 (dryness covering less 10% of body surface area and no associated erythema or pruritus) to 3 (dryness covering greater than 30% of body surface area and associated with itching; limits daily self care activities of daily living).

The Symptoms subscale looks at the average score of questions 1-4 individual responses regarding symptoms; the symptoms score is transformed to a linear scale ranging from 0 (never bothered) to 100 (always bothered) so a higher score indicates a lower quality of life. Baseline will be compared to the subjects' final visit (Week 5 +/- 1 week)., Baseline to Week 5 +/- 1 week|Mean Change from Baseline to Visit 2 in Skindex-16 Functional Subscale, The Skindex-16 is a dermatology-specific quality of life measuring tool (The SKINDEX contact information and permission to use: Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France.

Many patients undergoing cancer therapies experience skin reactions like dry skin, rash, redness, itchiness, and hyperpigmentation. Dry skin and itching are especially common for those undergoing chemotherapy and targeted treatments.

Skincare products containing Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour have a long history of tolerance and efficacy in treating various skin conditions involving pruritus (itching) and xerosis (dry skin), as Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour is known for its skin protectant properties and soothing effects on skin. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a regimen of three topical agents containing Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour for cancer patients experiencing mild to moderate pruritus and/or xerosis.

Participants will received the products at Baseline (Visit 1) and return to the clinical site at Week 5 +/- 1 week for Visit 2. In addition, questionnaires will be completed remotely between Baseline and Visit 2.
