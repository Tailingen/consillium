Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Breast Cancer
Primary objective:

* Compare disease-free survival in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-neu-expressing node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable breast cancer treated with adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin) vs trastuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin.

Secondary objective:

* Compare overall survival of participants treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic effects (including cardiac) of these regimens in these participants.
* Compare quality of life of participants treated with these regimens.
* Compare pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy of these regimens in these participants.
* For substudy: Compare peripheral levels of shed HER2-neu extracellular domain with fluorescence in situ hybridization in predicting outcome in participants treated with these regimens.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Herceptin|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants With Disease Free Survival at 5 Years, Disease Free Survival was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional or metastatic relapse or the date of second primary cancer (with the exception of curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix) or death from any cause whichever occured first. Disease free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization until relapse or death or up to 5 years
Percentage of Participants With Disease Free Survival at 10 Years, Disease free survival was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of local, regional or metastatic relapse or the date of second primary cancer (with the exception of curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix) or death from any cause whichever occured first. Disease free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization until relapse or death or up to 10 years|Overall Survival- Percentage of Participants Who Survived at 10 Years, Overall survival of the participants was measured from the date of randomization up to the date of death due to any cause. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization until death or up to 10 years
