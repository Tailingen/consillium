Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma
This phase II trial tests whether hypofractionated radiation works to treat patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a fewer number of days than tradition radiation therapy courses for Merkel cell carcinoma. This may be less suppressive of the immune response to tumors and should be helpful for patient convenience.
Merkel Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Radiation therapy
To establish the 2-year local control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the primary tumor bed. And to establish the 2-year nodal control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the primary draining nodal bed., through study completion, an average of 2 year
* To estimate the 2-year local control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the primary tumor bed.
* To estimate the 2-year nodal control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the primary draining nodal basin.

Secondary Objectives

* To determine MCC disease outcomes including:time to non-nodal locoregional recurrence, time to nodal recurrence, time to distant mestasis, disease-free-survival and disease-specific survival for patients receiving hypofractionated adjuvant RT.
* To assess acute and late RT associated toxicity within or neighboring the radiated field.
