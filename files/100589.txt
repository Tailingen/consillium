Telehealth Exercise Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Lymphoma Survivors, TECHS Trial
This clinical trial tests how well a telehealth exercise intervention works to improve cardiovascular health in lymphoma survivors. Telehealth exercise is a service to help perform physical exercises at home with a care provider online. With the use of telehealth exercise lymphoma survivors may be able to participate in exercise programs safely to improve heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

OTHER: Exercise Intervention|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|OTHER: Telemedicine
Adherence to the telehealth exercise intervention, Adherence will be measured by the number of exercise sessions attended over the exercise sessions prescribed (17/24 sessions)., Up to 2 years
Effects of an 8-week telehealth exercise intervention, The physiologic effects of telehealth exercise intervention will be assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2) using cardiopulmonary exercise testing., At baseline up to week 9
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Determine the feasibility of an 8-week telehealth exercise intervention, as assessed by enrollment, retention, and adherence to the telehealth exercise intervention.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Explore the effects of an 8-week telehealth exercise intervention on cardiovascular health, assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, pulmonary function test, body compositions, and blood biomarkers.

OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I (TELEHEALTH EXERCISE): Patients participate in telehealth exercise intervention for 30 minutes per day, 3 days a week for 8 weeks.

GROUP II (DELAYED CONTROL): Patients maintain current levels of physical activity for 8 weeks. Patients may then participate in telehealth exercise intervention for 8 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up after 1 week.
