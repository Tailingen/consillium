Health Education Approach to Lung Screening
Evaluate the impact of the patient navigation program on the proportion of patients who complete lung cancer screening (LCS), defined as undergoing a low dose computed tomography (LDCT)
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Patient Navigation
Number of study patients who complete lung cancer screening (LCS) through the patient navigation process, Evaluate the impact of the patient navigation program on the number of patients who complete lung cancer screening (LCS), defined as undergoing a low dose computed tomography (LDCT)., 2 weeks to 4 months following day 1, varies by participant
Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the patient navigation program, Determine the number of participants that are satisfied with the navigation program by utilizing Was It Worth It instrument; that consists of 8 items that are are answered "yes", "no" or "uncertain"., Day 1|Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the patient navigation program, Determine the number of participants that are satisfied with the navigation program by utilizing Was It Worth It instrument; that consists of 8 items that are are answered "yes", "no" or "uncertain" after the navigation program., 2 weeks to 4 months following day 1, varies by participant|Assess the impact of the patient navigation program on patient health-related quality of life at baseline., Utilizing Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) v1.2 Global Health Scale (10 items) scores before and after navigation intervention. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) v1.2 Global Health Scale (10 items), measures assess physical, mental, and social health where 5=Never, 4=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 2=Often, and 1=Always. Higher scores indicate better health., Day 1|Assess the impact of the patient navigation program on patient health-related quality of life after navigation intervention., Utilizing Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) v1.2 Global Health Scale (10 items) scores before and after navigation intervention. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) v1.2 Global Health Scale (10 items), measures assess physical, mental, and social health, where 5=Never, 4=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 2=Often, and 1=Always. Higher scores indicate better health., 2 weeks to 4 months following day 1, varies by participant|Assess the impact of the patient navigation program on patient financial distress, Determine the number of participants that have financial distress at baseline utilizing Financial Distress measure scores at baseline. Study-specific financial distress measure (8 items) each item will need to be individually coded 1-5, with 1=completely disagree to 5=completely agree and 98 for Don't know and 99 for Not applicable., Day 1|Assess the impact of the patient navigation program on patient financial distress, Determine the number of participants that have lessening financial distress after the navigation program utilizing Financial Distress measure scores at baseline. Study-specific financial distress measure (8 items) each item will be individually coded 1-5, with 1=completely disagree to 5=completely agree and 98 for Don't know and 99 for Not applicable., 2 weeks to 4 months following day 1, varies by participant
This is a single-arm study of a patient navigation intervention to increase access to lung cancer screening (LCS).
