Controlled Ovarian Stimulation in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer PatiEnts (fAMHOPE)
This is a multicenter hospital-based prospective cohort study conducted in institutions with known expertise in performing oocytes/embryo freezing for fertility preservation. The study aims at refining the understanding of the efficacy and safety of controlled ovarian stimulation with or without letrozole in young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are candidates to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients enrolled in this study undergo standard or "random start" ovarian stimulation with Gonadotropins using antagonist protocol before the beginning of chemotherapy. Ovulation is triggered in all patients with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone-GnRH agonist.

After retrieval, oocytes are denuded and matured oocytes are subjected to fertilization before embryo freezing or direct vitrification.

Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of performing a controlled ovarian stimulation with or without letrozole in young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are candidates to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of mature oocytes collected.
