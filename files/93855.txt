IMP321 (Eftilagimod Alpha) as Adjunctive to a Standard Chemotherapy Paclitaxel Metastatic Breast Carcinoma
The proposed Phase IIb clinical study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of the active immunotherapy IMP321 in combination (adjunctive) with paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

This is a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1 randomised Phase IIb study in female hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. The study comprises of two stages.

Stage 1 is the open-label, safety run-in stage consisting of cohort 1 and 2 to confirm the (RPTD) of IMP321 in combination with paclitaxel.

Stage 2 is placebo-controlled, double-blind randomisation stage, paclitaxel + IMP321 at the RPTD will be compared to paclitaxel + placebo.
