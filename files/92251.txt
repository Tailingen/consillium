Safety Study of BLZ-100 in Adult Subjects With Glioma Undergoing Surgery
Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. We hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with gliomas undergoing surgery.
Glioma
DRUG: BLZ-100
Number of participants with adverse events, Safety will be assessed by physical examination and measurement of vital signs and laboratory safety parameters., Seven days after study drug administration
Change in concentration of BLZ-100 in the blood, BLZ-100 levels in blood will be analyzed by chemical means and these data will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters., Prior to dosing and at 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins and 120 mins after end of injection
Fluoresence signal in excised brain tumor and normal brain cancer, Fluorescence signal in sections of excised tumor and adjacent normal tissue will be measured using an infrared imaging system., at least 2 hours post-dose
Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.

Subjects will be required to arrive at the hospital (or phase 1 unit if applicable) for dosing at least 2 hours before the planned surgical excision. Following dosing, subjects will be monitored for safety and surgical excision will occur at least 2 hours after study product administration.
