Can a commercially available vibrating chair increase the number of urothelial cells in a urine sample of healthy participants non-invasively? The investigators plan is participants will alternate 15 minutes of drinking eight fluid ounces of water and 15 minutes of sitting in the vibrating chair for one hour. The control group will alternate 15 minutes of drinking eight fluid ounces of water and 15 minutes of sitting in a non-vibrating chair for one hour. Then, urine samples will be collected and examined for urothelial cell concentration for both groups.
