Efficacy of Pre-operative Prehabilitation in Patients With Limb Sarcoma
This Phase II feasibility study, prospective, interventional, monocentric aiming to assess the interest of pre-operative rehabilitation in patients treated for bone or soft-tissue sarcoma of the limbs.

This protocol will be based on the realisation of a surgical prehabilitation program adapted to the patient. This strategy will involve a team of several health professionals: rehabilitation doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, specialised nurse, dietician and adapted physical activity teacher.

The aim of an adapted surgical prehabilitation program is to improve the functional recovery of the treated limb and the patient's autonomy after surgery.

Each patient will be followed until 24 months post surgery.
