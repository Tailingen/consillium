Opioid Sparing Effect of Thoracic Epidural Analgesia for Open Upper Abdominal Surgery
This prospective randomized controlled study is aimed to determine the advantages of thoracic epidural analgesia for open upper abdominal surgery in combination with multimodal analgesia compared with no thoracic epidural analgesia on postoperative pain control. The primary outcome is total opioid consumption in postoperative 72 hours. Secondary outcomes are the success of continuous epidural analgesia or complications of this technique, pain intensity, morbidity and mortality compare to no continuous epidural analgesia.

Continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) for open upper abdominal surgery has been showed the analgesic analgesia for open abdominal surgery. However the technical difficulty, complications especially hypotension, pruritus of CEA impede the popularity of technique compared to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) in multimodal analgesia. This study is aimed to study of the role of CEA and multimodal analgesia in open abdominal surgery compare to IV PCA.
