Fluzoparib in Combination With Camrelizumab and Temozolomide in Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well fuzoparib in combination with camrelizumab and temozolomide works in treating patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma with the homologous recombination (HR) pathway gene mutation / alteration.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR of Fluzoparib in combination with Camrelizumab and Temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma with genetic homologous recombination (HR) mutation/ alteration using RECIST v1.1, 6 months
Treatment with PARP inhibitors could represent a novel opportunity to selectively kill a subset of cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair pathways. Non-BRCA deficiencies in homologous recombination DNA repair genes could also enhance tumor cell sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Therefore, PARP inhibitors are also selectively cytotoxic for cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair proteins other than BRCA1 and BRCA2.

In melanoma, genetic HR mutation/ alterations are rather common. Retrospective data showed that nearly18-40% of melanoma harbors a mutation in at least 1 of the HR genes in their tumor. The commonly altered genes were ARID1A, FANCA, ATM, BRCA1, ATRX and BRCA2, ATR, BRCA1 BRIP1 and SF3B1. These findings indicate that HR mutations / alterations are frequently observed in metastatic melanoma, and they suggest that PARP inhibitors could potentially be of a great clinical value in a substantial portion of the patients with advanced melanoma.

In this clinical study, clinical efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with camrelizumab and temozolomide will be evaluated by assessing an objective clinical response rate in patients with advanced, metastatic melanoma with the homologous recombination (HR) pathway gene mutation / alteration.
