Multi-Tracer PET Prediction and Assessment of Response to Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Study of multi-tracer PET scans to assess response to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: PET/CT scan to assess treatment efficacy
FDG Therapeutic Responses to 1 Cycle, The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one cycle) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and fluorothymidine (FLT). The percent change in the SUVmax for FDG was determined. From these percent change determinations, a response determination was obtained based on the EORTC criteria. EORTC response criteria define a response as \>25% reduction in SUVmax., 1 month|FLT Therapeutic Responses to 1 Cycle, The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one cycle) with FDG and FLT. The percent change in the SUVmax for FLT was determined. From these percent change determinations, a response determination was obtained based on the EORTC criteria. EORTC response criteria define a response as \>25% reduction in SUVmax., 1 month|RECIST 1.1 Therapeutic Responses to 1 Cycle, The patients underwent baseline and repeat PET/CT imaging (after one cycle) with FDG and FLT. Tumor response was determined by RECIST 1.1 and defined as a \>30% reduction in tumor size as determined by the sum of the longest diameters of each index lesion, 1 month
