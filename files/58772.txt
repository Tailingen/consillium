Pembrolizumab in Combination With Doxorubicin in Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
This is a non-randomized, single arm, multi-center, phase II study of pembrolizumab in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with recurrent/metastatic endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Neoplasms
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
PFS rate at 6 months according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, To evaluate the efficacy of anti-PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab in combination with immunogenic chemotherapy with doxorubicin in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer in terms of patients who survived progression free (PFS) at least 6 months., 6 months
To determine PFS rate at 6 months according to RECIST 1.1 criteria in the different groups by the genomic-The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification; namely POLE, MSI, and Microsatellite Stable (MSS), 6 months|To determine median PFS and ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., PFS, defined as the time from allocation to the first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. ORR will be used as the primary endpoint per RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by investigators., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|To determine median PFS and ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria in different genomic-TCGA subgroups, Through study completion, an average of 3 years|To determine median OS and OS rate, At 1, and 2-years|To evaluate median OS and OS rate at 1, and 2-years according to genomic-TCGA classification., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|To evaluate DoR, defined as the time from first documented evidence of complete response (CR)or partial response (PR) until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Number and grade of AEs, ECIs, SAEs, fatal SAEs, and laboratory changes that are Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Through study completion, an average of 3 years
