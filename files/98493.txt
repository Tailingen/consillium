* Any Grade \>=3 non-irAE toxicity that doesn't resolve to Grade \<=1 or baseline status within 14 days A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or worse AE related to AZD5069 that occurs from first dose of AZD5069 up to end of DLT period., Cohort 1: From time of first dose of MEDI4736 on Day 1 up to Day 28 of Cycle 1 and Cohort 2: From time of first dose of AZD5069 and MEDI4736 on Day 1 up to Day 28 of Cycle 1 or until a participant experiences a DLT, whichever occurs first.|Number of Participants With AEs, An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to study treatment, whether or not considered causally related to study treatment. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms, signs or abnormal results of an investigation. A serious AE (SAE) is an AE that fulfills one or more following criteria: death, life-threatening, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital abnormality or birth defect, and an important medical event that may jeopardize participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of outcomes listed above. AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were those with action taken was 'Drug Permanently Discontinued' for any study treatment. Only treatment emergent AEs were presented., From first dose of study treatment administration (Day 1) until 90 days after the last dose of IP or initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever occurred first), approximately 30 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Cohort 2, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). A confirmed response of CR/PR means that a response of CR/PR is recorded at 1 visit and confirmed by repeat imaging, preferably at the next regularly scheduled imaging visit and not less than 4 weeks after the visit when the response was first observed with no evidence of progression between the initial and CR/PR confirmation visit. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters as long as criteria for PD were not met. ORR was determined using Investigator assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 6 weeks +/-7 days for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks +/-7 days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression. Up to approximately 30 months.
Duration of Response (DoR) in Cohort 2, DoR was defined as the time from the first documentation of CR/PR (which is subsequently confirmed) until the date of progression/death, or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for participants that did not progress or did progress after 2 missed visits of the last evaluable assessment (or first dose). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. DoR was determined using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1 and was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 6 weeks +/-7 days for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks +/-7 days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression. Up to approximately 30 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR) in Cohort 2, DCR at 6 months is defined as the percentage of participants who had a best objective response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first 6 months (i.e. 24+1=25 weeks to allow for a late assessment within the assessment window) or who had demonstrated stable disease (SD) for a minimum interval of 24 weeks (minus 1 week to allow for an early assessment within the assessment window, i.e. 161 days) following the start of treatment. DCR at 12 months is defined as the percentage of participants who had a BoR of CR or PR in the first 12 months (i.e. 48+1=49 weeks to allow for a late assessment within the assessment window) or who had demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 48 weeks (minus 1 week to allow for an early assessment within the assessment window, i.e. 329 days) following the start of treatment. DCR was determined using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1., RECIST assessments were performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment) and every 6 weeks +/- 7 days for first 48 weeks up to 6 months and 12 months|Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Cohort 2, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdraws from allocated therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. PFS was determined using Investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1 and calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 6 weeks +/-7 days for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks +/-7 days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression. Up to approximately 30 months.|Progression-Free Survival Rate at 3 Months (PFS3) in Cohort 2, The PFS rate was defined as percentage of participants alive and progression-free after 3 months. The PFS3 was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Tumor progression was determined based on Investigator assessment and RECIST v1.1., RECIST assessments were performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment) and every 6 weeks +/- 7 days up to 3 months|Progression-Free Survival Rate at 6 Months (PFS6) in Cohort 2, The PFS6 was defined as percentage of participants alive and progression-free after 6 months. The PFS6 was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Tumor progression was determined based on Investigator assessment and RECIST v1.1., RECIST assessments were performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment) and every 6 weeks +/- 7 days up to 6 months|Median Overall Survival (OS) in Cohort 2, OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause (i.e. date of death or censoring - date of first dose + 1). OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive (censored at end of study)., RECIST assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment), every 6 weeks +/-7 days for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks +/-7 days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression. Up to approximately 30 months.|Overall Survival at 6 Months (OS6) in Cohort 2, OS6 is defined as percentage of participants alive at 6 months from first dose of study treatment. OS6 was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 6 months., From first dose of study treatment (Day 1) up to 6 months|Overall Survival at 12 Months (OS12) in Cohort 2, OS12 is defined as percentage of participants alive at 12 months from first dose of study treatment. OS12 was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 12 months., From first dose of study treatment (Day 1) up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibody (ADAs) for MEDI4736 in Cohort 2, Samples were measured for the presence of ADAs and ADA-neutralizing antibodies for MEDI4736 using validated assays. Persistently positive is defined as positive at \>=2 post-baseline assessments or positive at the last post-baseline assessment. Transiently positive is defined as having at least one post-baseline ADA positive assessment and not fulfilling the conditions of persistently positive. NAB = neutralizing antibody., On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; At months 3 and 6 after last dose|Mean Plasma Concentrations of MEDI4736 in Cohort 2, Mean peak and trough plasma concentrations of MEDI4736 are presented., Predose (within 60 minutes prior to treatment with any IP) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; and post infusion (within 10 minutes after end of MEDI4736 infusion) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 7|Mean Plasma Concentrations of AZD5069 in Cohort 2, Mean peak and trough plasma concentration of AZD5069 are presented. Concentration of AZD5069 was calculated by plasma concentration-time profile., Predose (within 60 minutes prior to treatment with any IP) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; and postdose (within 10 minutes after end of MEDI4736 infusion) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 7
This is a Phase Ib and II open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with chemotherapy or AZD5069 in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study will consist of 2 independent cohorts.
