Early Detection of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Using a Panel of Biomarkers
Urine and blood samples are being collected from patients with and without diseases of the pancreas. These samples will be tested with the aim of developing an accurate way of diagnosing diseases of the pancreas using the results.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Accuracy of biomarker panel and affiliated risk score, Test accuracy, as measured by sensitivity/specificity (SN/SP) and positive predictive value/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV)., Baseline until completion of standard-of-care diagnostic testing (up to 12 months after enrolment)
Accuracy of biomarker panel and affiliated risk score when combined with CA19-9 result, Test accuracy, as measured by sensitivity/specificity (SN/SP) and positive predictive value/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV)., Baseline until completion of standard-of-care diagnostic testing (up to 12 months after enrolment)|Economic and social impact of using biomarker panel for PDAC testing, Stakeholder and health economics analyses of the inclusion of the urine test into the existing diagnostic and surveillance pathways for PDAC., Baseline until completion of standard-of-care diagnostic testing (up to 12 months after enrolment)
The main aim of this research study is to establish the accuracy of a urinary biomarker panel (LYVE1, REG1B, TFF1), and affiliated PancRISK score alone or in combination with plasma CA19-9 for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Samples will be collected from symptomatic individuals with suspected pancreatic cancer, and asymptomatic subjects at risk of developing PDAC.

The results of urine biomarker and CA19-9 analysis carried out on these samples will be compared to the imaging and, where available, histopathology data, which will inform the development of a predictive model to detect PDAC earlier.
