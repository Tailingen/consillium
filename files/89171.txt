A Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Conventional Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 2 study to test the hypothesis that venetoclax in combination with standard chemotherapy will be tolerable and active in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Primary Objectives:

* Establish the tolerability adding venetoclax to standard chemotherapy in pediatric patients with AML
* Estimate the proportion of patients who become minimal residual disease (MRD) negative by flow cytometry after one course of venetoclax-based induction therapy

Secondary Objectives:

- Estimate the rates of complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) in pediatric patients who receive venetoclax-based chemotherapy
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin|DRUG: Daunorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Idarubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Gilteritinib
Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate, Will compute a binomial confidence interval for the proportion of MRD-evaluable patients who become MRD-negative (defined as MRD \< 0.1%) after induction 1., At day 29 after induction 1|Incidence of death or unacceptable adverse event, A patient is deemed to have tolerated a course of therapy if they complete that course without death or an unacceptable adverse event. Will monitor the tolerability or each course using multi-stage binomial stopping rules. Will use the method of Jung and Kim to compute 95% confidence intervals that adjust for the multi-stage monitoring., From initiation to completion of each course of therapy, an average of 6 weeks
Event-free survival, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used and 95% confidence intervals will be computed for event-free survival at 3 years., From study enrollment to disease resistance, relapse, development of a second malignancy, or death due to any cause (up to 3 years after the last enrollment).|Overall survival, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used and 95% confidence intervals will be computed for overall survival at 3 years., From protocol enrollment until death (up to 3 years after the last enrollment).
Treatment will be based on genetic characteristics and response to therapy. Venetoclax will be given with each course of therapy. Low-risk patients will receive four courses of chemotherapy and intermediate-risk patients will receive five courses. High-risk patients who do not have a suitable stem cell donor or who decline HCT will receive five courses of chemotherapy. The definition of suitable stem cell donor and the conditioning regimens used for HCT will be determined by local institutional protocols or guidelines.
