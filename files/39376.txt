Application of Left Colic Artery Preservation, Anastomotic Reinforcing Sutures and Transanal Tube in Robotic Low Anterior Resection
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of combined application of left colic artery preservation, anastomotic reinforcing sutures and postoperative transanal tube placement in robotic Low Anterior Resection for Rectal Cancer.
Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: Transanal tube placement|PROCEDURE: Left colic artery preservation|PROCEDURE: Anastomotic reinforcing sutures|DEVICE: Robotic surgery
Anastomotic leak rate, Anastomotic leak is a common and serious complication after low anterior, resection, and often leads to re-operation., 30 days post operatively
Reoperation rate after anastomotic leak, Anastomotic leak is a common and serious complication after low anterior, resection, and often leads to excrement peritonitis, and re-operation as colostomy, 30 days post operatively
Combined application of left colic artery preservation, anastomotic reinforcing sutures and postoperative transanal tube placement in robotic low anterior resection for rectal cancer
