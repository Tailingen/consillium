A Study Evaluating ANV600 Single Agent or in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors (EXPAND-1)
The purpose of study ANV600-001 is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of ANV600 administered as a single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.
