Study of Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib in Metastatic and Recurrent Cervix Cancer (LenPem Cervix)
The main purpose of this study is to gather information about an investigational drug combination, Lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab, that may help to treat cervical cancers. In this study, we are looking to see whether the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab has any effect on slowing tumor growth in cervical cancer tumors.
Cervix Cancer|Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1, Objective Response (ORR) is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to Recist (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) v1.1., Baseline up to approximately 36 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1, Safety and tolerability of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab after prior checkpoint inhibitor and/or other prior treatment.

Adverse events will be assessed as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose date until the date of the first documented disease progression, or death up to 36 months
Dose of pembrolizumab :

The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). for a total of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab.

Participants who complete study intervention after 2 years of pembrolizumab are eligible for up to 1 year of additional pembrolizumab (second course) upon experiencing disease progression.

Lenvatinib Dosing Regimen:

lenvatinib 20 mg/day plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W.
