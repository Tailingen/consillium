Donor Stem Cell Transplant, Pentostatin, and Total-Body Irradiation in Treating Patients With Hematological Cancer
RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant and giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving a donor stem cell transplant after pentostatin and total-body irradiation and to see how well it works in treating patients with hematological cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the safety of pentostatin and low-dose total body irradiation followed by T-cell-reduced unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, in terms of regimen-related toxicity, in patients with hematological malignancies.
* To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, measured as engraftment rate and establishment of donor hematopoietic chimerism, in these patients.

Secondary

* To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE:

* Reduced-intensity preparative regimen: Patients receive pentostatin IV over 30 minutes once daily on days -10 to -8 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation on day -1.
* Unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo T-cell-reduced donor PBSCT on day 0.
* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours twice daily on days -1, 0, and 1 and then orally twice daily on days 2-70 followed by a taper in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-27 followed by a taper.

Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsies and blood sample collection periodically for laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-γ, IL-1β, and IL-10) by ELISA; phenotypic, molecular, and functional analysis of immunologic reconstitution markers (i.e., PHA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, Fas, FasL, TNF, TGF-β, and IFN-γ) by flow cytometry; and cytogenetics by FISH.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
