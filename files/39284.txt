Treatment of Hairy Cell Leukaemia Variant and Relapsing Hairy Cell Leukaemia With Cladribine Plus Rituximab
The study will test the effectiveness (rate of complete remissions, total remission rate and duration of remission) and toxicity of the combined immuno/chemotherapy with subcutaneous cladribine (LITAK®) plus anti-CD20\* antibody rituximab in patients requiring treatment for relapsed hairy cell leukaemia or hairy cell leukaemia variant independent of any previous therapy.

CD20\* = cluster of differentiation antigen 20
Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)
DRUG: 2CdA +/- Rituximab
Rate of complete remissions (CR), Determination of the rate of complete remission and duration of remission after one cycle of subcutaneous cladribine (LITAK®) plus four administrations of rituximab

* in patients with hairy cell leukaemia variant
* in patients with relapsed hairy cell leukaemia, 4 months after treatment
Overall remission rate (ORR), The rate of CR + PR will be determined, 4 months after treatment
Acute and late toxicity, All kind of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, infections, unplanned hospitalisations will be measured, From day 1 of treatment period up to 120 months|Degree of induced immunodeficiency, Degree of immunosupression with CD4/CD8 quotient as indicating biomarker will be measured.

Duration of immunosupression as well as infectious and other complications which result from therapy will be reported, From day 1 of treatment period up to 120 months|Frequency of secondary neoplasia during the life-long follow-up period, Rate of secondary neoplasia as safety issue will be determined, From day 1 of treatment period up to 120 months|Overall survival (OS), Determination of the overall survival times of all patients, From achieving a remission until death
The trial is a prospective, multi-centre, open Phase II study on patients with hairy cell leukaemia variant or with relapsed hairy cell leukaemia.
