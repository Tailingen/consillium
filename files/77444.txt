Etoposide in Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Ependymoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well etoposide works in treating young patients with ependymoma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: etoposide|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
Response rate by MRI after course 3
Second surgery or additional radiotherapy in responding patients as assessed by MRI scan after course 3 or 6
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the response rate in young patients with relapsing and/or refractory ependymoma treated with a rapid schedule of intravenous etoposide.

Secondary

* Determine the possibility of second surgery or additional radiotherapy in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose tumor becomes resectable after courses 3 or 6 undergo surgical resection.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for approximately 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
