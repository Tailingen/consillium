Prospective Study of Mylotarg and G-CSF in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a neoplasm of immature hematopoietic cells (blasts) with altered ripening capacity. Due to excessive proliferation, the blasts displace normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow failure appears. Leukemic cells also infiltrate extramedullary tissues.

Following the standard chemotherapy treatment, the CR rate achieved is around 65-75% for all patients and 15% lower when considering only patients over 65 years. Modifications to the standard regimen consist of replacing the DNR for a cytotoxic one, modifying the dose of ara-C or adding a third drug.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg ®) is an immunoconjugate between anti-CD33 antibody and a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin. Mylotarg ® antibody specifically binds to CD33, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed in over 90% of LMA10. Mylotarg ® selectively transports the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin into leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors differentiated from the myelomonocytic line, while respecting the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Calicheamicin is released only after the fixation of the antibody anti-CD33 and its internalization by the cell, after which binds to and damages the DNA.

Mylotarg ® is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CD33 positive AML in first relapse, for patients older than 60 years non-candidates for other intensive treatment modalities.

Since the efficacy of Mylotarg ® is equivalent and its toxicity profile less than the conventional therapy, it is logical to conduct a phase II trial exploring the role of Mylotarg ® in the early stages of treatment of AML.

Previous experience with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed patients led to its use combined with induction chemotherapy. The aim was to improve the CR rate reached with the latter and reduce relapse after achieving greater leukemic cytoreduction.

Recent data from the HOVON group support that the administration of G-CSF before and during induction chemotherapy decreases the incidence of relapse in patients with AML, particularly those considered to have intermediate risk.

Everything mentioned above justifies to investigate the combination of GO combined with chemotherapy with IDR and ara-C in standard 3x7 scheme and analyze the effect of sensitization with G-CSF in patients with AML de novo. If the treatment proposed here is effective and presents an acceptable toxicity it should be investigated.
Novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Mylotarg
Complete Remission of the Disease, Rate of patients that have obtained complete remission. Complete remission is defined as, bone marrow normocellular or slightly hypocellular with proportion of blasts \<5%, including the erythroid cell count (and including promonocytes in case of M5), no Auer rods, no extramedullary leukemia, neutrophils and platelets rising. The persistence of minimal residual disease in immunophenotypic study will not invalidate the standard cytogenetic complete remission., 28 days after chemotherapy
Secondary Toxicity to Mylotarg(R), Hematological toxicity, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity, fever and infections, pulmonary complications, duration of hospitalization, Baseline, weekly during treatment and at month 3 and month 6 after first induction.|Mortality at Induction, all deaths occurring after the first administration of MylotargTM until the time of transplantation with no leukemic relapse has occurred, and all deaths in the 6 first months after administration of the second dose of MylotargTM with no leukemic relapse occurred., Weekly during treatment, at third month and at 6 months after last administration of Mylotarg|Capacity to Obtain Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC) for Autotransplantation - DATA NOT COLLECTED, Rate of patients with capacity to obtain hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) for autotransplantation. This analysis has not been performed, because data were not available in sites., One month before transplant, expected at 9 months after end of treatment.|Relapse After 6 Months, Rate of patients that have relapse after 6 months of obtained complete remission., 6 months from complete remission|Survival After 6 Months, rate of patients alive within 6 months of obtained complete remission, 6 months after complete remission
