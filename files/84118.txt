Clinical Study of Asciminib in Previously Treated Indian Patients With Ph+ CML-CP Without T315I Mutation and in Patients With Ph+ CML-CP With T315I Mutation
The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has granted approval for Asciminib film-coated 40 mg tablets on 20 Oct 2023 with the condition to perform a Phase IV clinical study in Indian patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) per the India Prescribing Information (PI). The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, Phase IV study is, therefore, to confirm the safety and efficacy of Asciminib in Indian patients with Ph+ CML-CP (without threonine-315 residue with isoleucine \[T315I\] mutation), previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and patients with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation.

This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, post-authorization interventional study to assess the safety and efficacy of asciminib in Indian participants with Ph+ CML-CP (without T315I mutation), previously treated with 2 or more TKIs and participants with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation irrespective of the line of treatment.

The study will include 3 periods: a screening period (up to 21 days), a treatment period of up to 6 months with asciminib (with dosing according to mutation status), and a safety follow-up period for 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment. Completion of the safety follow-up period after the last dose of the study treatment will be considered as the End of Study (EOS).

After obtaining the written informed consent form (ICF) from the participant or their legally authorized representatives (LARs), the participants will undergo screening procedures to confirm their eligibility for the study.

The results of the breakpoint cluster region gene-Abelson proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase gene (BCR::ABL1) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) as well as the T315I mutation report need to be established and documented prior to enrollment into the study in the screening period in line with the inclusion criteria of the study. Participants with previously documented T315I mutated CML-CP will be directly considered for the screening procedures. If the status of the T315I mutation is not known, the participant will undergo a standardized Sanger sequencing/PCR/next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based T315I mutation test (as per the availability at the site).
