CAB-ROR2-ADC Safety and Efficacy Study in Patients With TNBC or Head & Neck Cancer (Ph1) and NSCLC or Melanoma (Ph2)
The objective of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of CAB-ROR2-ADC in solid tumors
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Melanoma|Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CAB-ROR2-ADC|BIOLOGICAL: PD-1 inhibitor
Phase 1: Safety Profile, Assess dose limiting toxicity as defined in the protocol, Up to 24 months|Phase 1: Safety Profile, Assess maximum tolerated dose as defined in the protocol, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Safety Profile, Frequency and severity of AEs and/or SAEs, Up to 24 months|Phase 2: Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR, Up to 24 months
Phase 1: Pharmacokinetics, Plasma concentrations of ADC, total antibody and MMAE, Up to 24 months|Phase 1: Pharmacokinetics, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to 24 months|Phase 1: Pharmacokinetics, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, Up to 24 months|Phase 1: Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR, Up to 24 months|Phase 1: Immunogenicity, The number and percentage of patients who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Duration of response (DOR), Time from the first documented OR until the first documented disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the first dose of IP until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Best overall response (OR), All post-baseline disease assessments that occur prior to the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 12 weeks, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Time to response (TTR), Time from the first dose of investigational product until the first documentation of OR, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Overall survival (OS), Time from the first dose of BA3021 treatment until death due to any cause, Up to 24 months|Phase 1 and 2: Tumor size, Percent change from baseline in tumor size, Up to 24 months
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of BA3021, a conditionally active biologic (CAB) ROR2-targeted antibody drug conjugate (CAB-ROR2-ADC) BA3021 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study will consist of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase with BA3021 in Phase 1. Phase 2 will study BA3021 alone or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.
