Reducing Rural Colon Cancer Disparities
The investigators will conduct pre-implementations assessments of primary care clinics within a rural health system to determine current practices and capacities regarding colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and follow-up, preferred evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to improve follow-up, and factors that could influence successful implementation and eventual impact of a multi-level intervention to increase timely and complete follow-up after positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in rural patients.
