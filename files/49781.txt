Study to Investigate Alternative Dosing Regimens of Belantamab Mafodotin in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study aims to evaluate alternative dosing regimens of single-agent belantamab mafodotin in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) to determine if an improved overall benefit/risk profile can be achieved by modifying the belantamab mafodotin dose, schedule, or both.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Belantamab mafodotin
Incidence rate of Grade â‰¥2 Corneal events according to the keratopathy visual acuity (KVA) scale, KVA scale is used to grade the corneal events from Grade 0-4. KVA grading is a composite score considering corneal exam findings (ranging from clear cornea \[Grade 0\] to corneal ulcer \[Grade 4\]), as well as changes in visual acuity (ranging from no change from Baseline in visual acuity \[Grade 0\] to visual acuity worse than 1.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (\[logMAR\] (20/200) \[Grade 4\]). The KVA grade is driven by the most severe finding., Up to 12 months
Cumulative event rate of corneal events to Week 16 (KVA scale), Up to Week 16|Incidence rate of corneal events by grade (KVA scale), KVA scale is used to grade the corneal events from Grade 0-4. KVA grading is a composite score considering corneal exam findings (ranging from clear cornea \[Grade 0\] to corneal ulcer \[Grade 4\]), as well as changes in visual acuity (ranging from no change from Baseline in visual acuity \[Grade 0\] to visual acuity worse than 1.0 logMAR (20/200) \[Grade 4\]). The KVA grade is driven by the most severe finding., Up to 12 months|Exposure adjusted incidence rate of corneal events by grade (KVA scale), The exposure adjusted incidence rate is defined as the number of participants with corneal events divided by the total exposure in subject years among participants in the respective treatment group at risk of an initial occurrence of the event., Up to 12 months|Median duration of dose delay, Median duration of dose delay is defined as the median duration in time of all the dose delays in the respective treatment group., Up to 12 months|Percentage of participants requiring dose reductions, dose delays, and study treatment discontinuation due to corneal events, Up to 12 months|Cumulative incidence of corneal events by grade, Cumulative incidence of corneal events by grade is calculated using the KVA scale, as the number of new events divided by the total number of individuals in the population at risk for a specific time interval., Up to 12 months|Toxicity Index score by assessment/visit, Toxicity Index score is defined as a function of the ordered toxicity grades, where the toxicity grades are represented in descending order by the sequence., Up to 12 months|Duration of corneal events, Duration of corneal events is defined as the sum of the duration of all the corneal events of a participant., Up to 12 months|Percentage of time on study with corneal events, Percentage of time on study with corneal events is defined as the duration of corneal events divided by the total amount of time that a participant is on the study in percentage., Up to 12 months|Change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), BCVA will be assessed as per Snellen (or Snellen-equivalent) chart., Up to 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with a confirmed partial response (PR) or better per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Up to 12 months|Percentage of participants with very good partial response (VGPR) or better, Up to 12 months|Time to response (TTR), Time between the date of randomization and the first documented evidence of response (PR or better) among participants who achieve confirmed PR or better., Up to 12 months|Duration of response (DoR), Time from first documented evidence of PR or better until progressive disease (PD) per IMWG or death due to any cause., Up to 12 months|Time to progression (TTP), Time from the date of randomization until the earliest date of documented PD (per IMWG Response Criteria) or death due to PD., Up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of randomization until the earliest date of documented PD (according to IMWG Response Criteria) or death due to any cause., Up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., Up to 12 months|Number of participants with AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), Up to 12 months|Number of participants with clinically significant changes in hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis laboratory parameters, Up to 12 months|Percentage of participants requiring dose reductions, dose delays, and study treatment discontinuation due to any AEs, Up to 12 months|Maximum concentration (Cmax) of belantamab mafodotin, Up to 12 months|Time taken to reach Cmax (Tmax) of belantamab mafodotin, Up to 12 months|Area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) of belantamab mafodotin, Up to 12 months|Number of participants with positive anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against belantamab mafodotin, Up to 12 months|Titers of ADAs against belantamab mafodotin, Up to 12 months
