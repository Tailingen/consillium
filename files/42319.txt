CD19 /22 CAR T Cells (AUTO3) for the Treatment of B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO3, a CAR T cell treatment targeting CD19 and CD22 in paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

BIOLOGICAL: AUTO3 (CD19/22 CAR T cells
Number of Patients With Grade 3-5 Toxicities Occurring Within the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Period of AUTO3 Infusion, Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) after the last dose of AUTO3.|Number of Patients With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of AUTO3, DLT was defined as i) any new non-hematological adverse event (AE) of Grade 3 or higher toxicity using the NCI CTCAE (version 5.0), which was probably or definitely related to AUTO3 therapy, which occurred within the DLT evaluation period, and which failed to resolve to Grade 2 or better within 14 days, despite appropriate supportive measures; ii) Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity, cerebral edema, or Grade 3 neurotoxicity (including cerebral edema) that lasted \>72 hours; iii) Grade \>3 disseminated intravascular coagulation; iv) Grade \>2 infusion reaction; v) Any other fatal event (Grade 5) or life-threatening event (Grade 4) that could not be managed with conventional supportive measures or which in the opinion of the Safety Evaluation Committee (SEC) necessitated dose reduction or other modification to trial treatment to avoid a similar hazard in future patients., Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) after the last dose of AUTO3.|Number of Patients Achieving Morphological Remission (Complete Response(CR) or Complete Response With Incomplete Count Recovery (CRi) and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Negative Response in the Bone Marrow (PCR))., Morphological response evaluations were based on the response criteria for ALL according to the NCCN guidelines version 2.2014. Minimal residual disease-negative status was achieved if MRD was \<10\^-4 (0.01%) by PCR amplification of individual rearrangements of Ig genes and/or flow cytometry MRD testing., Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) post AUTO3 infusion
Feasibility of Generating AUTO3: Number of Patients' Cells Successfully Manufactured as a Proportion of the Number of Patients Undergoing Leukapheresis, Feasibility of product generation was examined by assessing the number of AUTO3 successfully manufactured as a fraction of the number of patients undergoing leukapheresis (all patients screened)., Up to 8 weeks post leukapheresis|Event-Free Survival (EFS) by Morphological Analysis, Time from date of first AUTO3 infusion until the earliest of treatment failure (defined as not achieving CR/CRi post AUTO3 infusion / no response), morphological relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Up to 2 years|Number of Patients With CD19- and/or CD22-negative Relapse, Up to 2 years|Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) by Morphological Analysis, Time from first achievement of morphological CR/CRi post AUTO3 treatment until the earliest of morphological relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Calculated from the date of AUTO3 treatment to the date of death anytime post AUTO3 infusion. Patients who had not died were censored at the date of last contact., Up to 2 years after the last patient was infused|Expansion of AUTO3 Following Adoptive Transfer, Expansion of AUTO3 was measured as the median peak (Cmax) of transgene levels in the peripheral blood after AUTO3 infusion, Up to 2 years|Persistence of AUTO3 Following Adoptive Transfer, Persistence of AUTO3 was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and/or flow cytometry at a range of time points in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow.

Persistence was defined as the timepoint in days of last detectable CAR T cell by qPCR or last assessment if zero copies per Î¼g DNA (whichever occurred later) before morphological relapse (Tlast)., Up to 2 years|Duration of B Cell Aplasia, Depletion of circulating B cells assessed by flow cytometry at a range of time points in the peripheral blood, Up to 2 years
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL will be enrolled in both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which is the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a CD19 and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product. Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO3 intravenously as a single or split dose and will then enter a 24-month follow-up period.
