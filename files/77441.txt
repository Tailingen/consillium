Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome Before Donor Stem Cell Transplant
This randomized clinical trial studies different chemotherapies in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome before donor stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells, and may prevent the myelodysplastic syndrome from coming back after the transplant. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Quality of Life Will be Assessed Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Questionnaire., The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) (version 3) is a 30-item cancer-specific questionnaire for measuring the health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. It includes five functioning scales (physical, PF; role, RF; cognitive, CF; emotional, EF; and social, SF), three symptom scales (fatigue, FA; pain, PA; and nausea and vomiting, NV), a global health status/QOL scale (GL), and six single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact of the disease and treatment). All items employ a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with lower scores representing a better outcome and higher scores a worse outcome; with the exception of two items in the GL scale, which use 7-point scales (1=very poor to 7=excellent) lower scores representing a worse outcome and higher score representing a better outcome., EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be collected at screening, after completion of therapy (HMA 4-6 month, and up to 6 months for induction-like chemotherapy) just prior to stem cell infusion and 100 (± 14) days after stem cell infusion (HSCT).|Quality of Life Will be Assessed Using the EORTC QLQ-HDC29 a Supplementary Module Assessing the Quality of Life During and After High-dose Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplantation., European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire High Dose Chemotherapy (EORTC QLQ-HDC29) is a treatment-specific quality of life questionnaire that addresses treatment specific side effects as well as emotional, social, and family issues for patients treated with high dose regimens and HCT. The QLQ-HDC29 module includes 29 items, consisting of 6 multi-item scales and 8 single-items; all items employ a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with lower scores representing a better outcome and higher scores a worse outcome with the exception of question 47 and 52 being the a higher score resulting in a better outcome and lower score a worse outcome., EORTC QLQ-HDC29 questionnaire will be collected after completion of therapy (HMA 4-6 month, and up to 6 months for induction-like chemotherapy) pre stem cell infusion (HSCT), and 100 (± 14) days post stem cell infusion (HSCT).|Overall Survival, The total length of follow-up will be 18 months from the start of treatment (day 1). Four categories were added for participants alive 18 months from start of treatment (day 1) 1) Participants alive after 18 months from start of treatment who received hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); 2) Participants alive after 18months from start of treatment who did not receive HCT.; 3) Participants deceased after 18 months from start of treatment who received HCT; 4) Participants deceased after 18 months from start of treatment who did not receive HCT., Up to 18 months|Number of Patients Who Relapse Post-transplant, To compare which of the two, intensive chemotherapy versus hypomethylating agent-based therapy, have a factor of relapse post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)., Up to 18 months|Number of Participants Who Received a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)., Frequency at which the participants received a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), Up to 18 months
OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Arm A: Patients receive decitabine or azacitidine intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) for 7 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles of decitabine or 6 cycles of azacitidine in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Arm B: Patients receive induction-like chemotherapy per standard of care or per experimental protocol. This study does not require a specific chemotherapy regimen for Arm B.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 18 months.
