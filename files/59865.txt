Neoadjuvant HS-10296 (Almonertinib) Therapy for Potential Resectable Stage III EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Almonertinib (HS-10296) as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for potential resectable stage III EGFR mutation-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III
DRUG: HS-10296 (Almonertinib)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have completed the neoadjuvant treatment before operation and have achieved CR or PR as confirmed by CT evaluation in all patients., up to 4 months
Major pathologic response (MPR), MPR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy before surgery., up to 5 months|Event free survival (EFS), It refers to the time from randomization to disease progression, cessation of treatment for any reason, or death, up to 60 months|Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the time from random enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date., up to 60 months|R0 resection rate, complete removal of the tumor, with a negative microscopic margin indicating no residual tumor, up to 6 months|Treatment-related adverse events, It refers to the number of adverse events related to HS-10296 as evaluated according to CTCAE v4.0., up to 13 months|Pathological complete response rate (pCR), It refers to the number of cases with no residual invasive cancer in the primary tumor and lymph node HE staining accounted for the proportion of all patients who completed the treatment., up to 24 months
Potential biomarkers, up to 24 months|Tumor microenvironment dynamics, up to 24 months
