18F-FMISO PET Guided Dose Escalation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma - a Feasibility and Planning Study
This study aims to investigate the use of 18F-FMISO PET in identifying hypoxic subvolume for dose escalation radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer and thus improve local control without significant increase in toxicities.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)
To investigate the dynamics of tumour hypoxia, A repeat 18F-FMISO-PET in week 3 of the 7 weeks long treatment regimen is planned. Fractionated radiotherapy is expected to induce reoxygenation within the tumor as iterative process by killing well oxygenated tumor cells with every fraction thereby reducing oxygen demand in the remaining tumor cells. Repetitive hypoxia imaging at week 3 allows for assessment of evolution of hypoxia during radiotherapy., From baseline and during 7 week long treatment regimen|To evaluate proportion of patients with contour-able hypoxic volume as well as the feasibility of generating dose-escalation radiotherapy plan with dosimetrically achieved parameters for target volume and organs-at-risk., Number of patients with feasible radiotherapy plan dose-escalation to more than 84Gy, At baseline and week 3 of RT|To estimate the correlation between immunohistochemical expression of CA-IX, VEGF and HIF-1a, (marker of hypoxia) and pre-treatment PET-SUV measurement, At baseline|To correlate 18F-FMISO PET uptake with tumor response at 3 months post radiotherapy, local control rate and disease free survival., From baseline up to 5 years
The specific aims of this study are:

1. To establish hypoxia imaging in NPC patients
2. Investigate the dynamics of tumor hypoxia before and during chemoradiation
3. Integrate hypoxia imaging into radiation treatment planning protocols
4. Design hypoxia adapted radiation schedules
5. Identify candidate hypoxia biomarkers
