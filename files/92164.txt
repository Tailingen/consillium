A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of Atezolizumab in Previously-Treated Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase III, single-arm, multicenter study of the long-term safety and efficacy of atezolizumab treatment in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed following standard systemic chemotherapy (including if given in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy or after anti-PD-1 as monotherapy).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Serious Adverse Event Incidence Rates, The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to atezolizumab., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
Overall Survival (OS) Rate, Overall survival (OS) rate at 2 years, defined as the proportion of patients remaining alive 2 years after initiation of study treatment, Baseline to 2 years|OS, Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to death from any cause, Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients who attain complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 and also by disease status evaluated by the investigator according to modified RECIST, Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from initial response to disease progression or death among patients who have experienced a CR or PR (unconfirmed) during the study., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|EQ-5D-5L Index-Based and VAS scores, EQ-5D-5L, EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire is a self-report health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. The EuroQol EQ-5D has two components: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health state. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction., Day 1 of first 3 cycles, then with tumor assessments every 6 weeks for 48 weeks from study treatment date; thereafter every 9 weeks until progressive disease or until treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 3 years)|EORTC QLQ-LC13 score, EORTC QLQ-LC13, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Supplemental Lung Cancer Module will be used to assess self-reported outcomes. EORTC QLQ-LC13 includes 13 items that address key lung cancer symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related adverse effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia) and pain medication. The dysphagia scale is multi-item, while the rest are single-item scales., Day 1 of first 3 cycles, then with tumor assessments every 6 weeks for 48 weeks from study treatment date; thereafter every 9 weeks until progressive disease or until treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 3 years)
