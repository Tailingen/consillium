A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Temozolomide in Adult Patients With Recurrent or Progressed Glioblastoma
This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1 safety run-in and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma who have not received prior bevacizumab therapy.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Temozolomide
Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Number of patients who experienced a dose limiting toxicity following a dosing of BBI608, 28 days after first administration of combination treatment (BBI608+TMZ)|Progression Free Survival (PFS)-6, To assess the effect of BBI608 + temozolomide (TMZ) therapy defined as the percentage of patients who have survived without objective disease progression for at least 6 months after treatment per neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria who had evaluable disease at baseline. PFS-6 is defined as the percentage of patients who survived without objective disease progression per RANO criteria for at least 6 months after treatment., From the time of exposure to study drug to first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 6 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS)-12, To assess the effect of BBI608 + temozolomide (TMZ) therapy defined as the percentage of patients who have survived without objective disease progression for at least 12 months after treatment per neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria who had evaluable disease at baseline. PFS-12 is defined as the percentage of patients who survived without objective disease progression per RANO criteria for at least 12 months after treatment., From the time of exposure to study drug to first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), To assess the effect of BBI608 + temozolomide (TMZ) on the overall survival of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who had not received prior treatment with bevacizumab or other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents who either were eligible or not eligible for surgical resection., From the time of exposure to study drug to death from any cause. If patient discontinued study drug, they were assessed the first 3 months after discontinuation, then every 3 months up to 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter until death.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To assess the percentage of patients that had evaluable disease at baseline with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria out of all patients who received at least one dose of any study drug and had evaluable disease at baseline., 4 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a documented complete response and partial response (CR + PR) based on RANO criteria., 4 weeks|Pharmacokinetic Profile of BBI608 and Temozolomide When Administered in Combination With Temozolomide as Assessed by the Area Under the Curve, The area under the curve of BBI608, from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration, calculated by a combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear up/log down method), On Day 1 and Day 5 after the first dosing, prior to dosing and 1, 2, 3, 5, 5h40m (day 1 only), 6, 7, 8 and 24 hours after first dose of BBI608|Pharmacodynamic Activity of BBI608 When Administered in Combination With Temozolomide as Assessed by Tumor Biopsy and Cancer Stem Cell Assays as Well as the Concentration of Study Drug in Tumors, Tumor samples to provide information of the biomarkers by histopathology and Cancer Stem Cell assays as well as the concentration of study drug in tumors., At the time of surgical resection
In arm A, patients who are candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 as monotherapy prior to resection, followed by post-operative BBI608 administered in combination with temozolomide. In arm B, patients who are not candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolomide.

In the phase 1/dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) cohort portion of this study, pharmacokinetics will be evaluated for both arms A and B. Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated in all patients who undergo surgical resection.
