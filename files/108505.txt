Reorganization of the Healthcare System During COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Management of Patients With Exocrine Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be the 2nd cause of death by cancer in Europe in 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has poor prognosis with an all-stages combined 5-year survival rate below 8%.

Since December 2019, a new coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is responsible of COVID-19 infection with potentially severe respiratory syndrome or even multi-organ failure. An increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in cancer patients is suggested in several Chinese series. Cancer care structures quickly reorganized to limit high-risk situations (diagnostic procedure, major surgery, cytotoxic poly-chemotherapy) and use alternatives such as on-hold chemotherapy. These reorganizations could be associated with a loss of chance for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
