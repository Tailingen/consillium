Trial of Hypofractionated IMRT Boost Versus Conventional IMRT Boost for Localized High Risk Prostate Cancer
Hypofractionation: 48 Gy in 25 fractions to pelvic lymph nodes while the prostate receives 68 Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly.

Standard Fractionation: pelvic lymph nodes and prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a subsequent boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy over 39 fractions.

RADIATION: Hypofractionated IMRT Radiation treatment
Disease free survival, The primary outcome for this study is PSA biochemical disease free survival at 5 years., 5 years
Late GI and GU toxicities, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0, change from 6 months post treatment to end of 5 year follow-up., 6 month post completion of treatment to end of 5 year follow up|Quality of life outcome: Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC), Measuring quality of life using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire. The EPIC questionnaire consists of 50 questions. Each question is scored from 1-5, 5 being the better outcome and 1 being the worst outcome in most of the questions, Baseline (start of treatment) to end of 5 year follow-up|Overall survival, Overall survival comparing two treatment arms, Baseline to end of 5 year follow-up|Cancer specific survival, Cancer specific survival comparing two treatment arms, Baseline to end of 5 year follow-up
Half the participants will receive using a one phase IMRT plan, the pelvic lymph nodes will be treated to a dose of 48 Gy in 25 fractions, while the prostate will be treated to a dose of 68 Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly (simulataneous integrated boost).

The other half of the participants will receive Standard fractionation using 2 sequential IMRT plans, the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a subsequent boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy.
