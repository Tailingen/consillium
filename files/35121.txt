RPTR-168 in Patients With Human Papillomavirus Strain 16 (HPV-16) E6/E7 Positive Tumors and Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of RPTR-168 as a monotherapy in patients with HPV-16 E6/E7 positive tumors (HNSCC, cervical) and melanoma.

This is a phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human, multi-center study to characterize the safety and tolerability of RPTR-168 administered i.v. as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic or locally-advanced HPV-16 E6/E7 positive tumors and melanoma.

The study will include 2 dosing periods: A Dose Escalation (Phase 1) followed by an Expansion (Phase 2).
