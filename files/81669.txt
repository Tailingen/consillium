Immune Response and Potential Booster for Patients Who Have Received HER2-pulsed DC1
The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to treat patients with a diagnosis of diagnosis of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2/neu (HER-2/neu) positive breast cancer in the past, who were previously treated with HER-2/neu-directed dendritic cells (DC) vaccines.

There is evidence that the use of anti-HER2 dendritic cell (DC) study vaccines could improve response to breast cancer therapy and be an important step in the prevention of recurrence.

This study will use a Dendritic Cell Type 1 (DC1) vaccine which is a HER2-sensitized dendritic cell (DC) study vaccine. Dendritic cells are immune cells that can tell the participant's immune system to fight infection. This study vaccine will be made from the participant's blood cells collected from a procedure called leukapheresis.
