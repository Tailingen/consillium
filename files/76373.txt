Nigerian Breast Cancer Risk-Reduction Study
The study will be a randomized controlled trial. The aim of the study is to determine the Breast Cancer (BC) risk and to evaluate the effect of BC risk counseling on lifestyle changes and adherence to risk-reduction practices among first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West Nigeria. This study's research questions are:

* What are the Nigeria Breast Cancer Study (NBCS) and Gail models estimates of the BC risk of first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West, Nigeria?
* What are the effects of BC risk assessment and counseling on adherence to breast screening recommendations among first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West, Nigeria?
* What are the effects of BC risk assessment and counseling on adherence to lifestyle risk reduction recommendations among first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West, Nigeria?
* What is the knowledge, attitudes, and perception of first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West Nigeria towards genetic testing and BC etiology?
* What factors predict breast screening among first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West Nigeria?
* What factors predict the time to first BC screening (post-intervention) among first-degree female relatives of BC patients in South-West Nigeria?

Participants will be randomized into the control arm (standard care) and intervention arms of the study. The intervention arm of the study will have a BC risk assessment followed by individualized BC risk counseling. In addition, the intervention arm will receive BC awareness and MammaCare速 BSE training. The control arm will receive only standard care comprising BC awareness and MammaCare速 BSE training. Both study arms will receive BC screening recommendations and lifestyle modification recommendations.

We hope that the BC risk counseling will improve BC screening practices and modification of risk behaviors and this hypothesis will be tested.
