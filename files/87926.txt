Exablate Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption for the Treatment of rGBM in Subjects Undergoing Carboplatin Monotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 system when used as a tool to open the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) undergoing carboplatin monotherapy.
Recurrent Glioblastoma
DRUG: Carboplatin|DEVICE: Exablate BBBD
Adverse events, All adverse events and/or Serious Adverse Events will be documented and reported according to CTCAE criteria., Through study completion, an average of 12 months|Contrast intensity on MR imaging, BBBD will be determined by contrast intensity in sonicated areas on T1 weighted gadolinium-based MR imaging, Immediately after Exablate BBBD procedure
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and feasibility of blood-brain-barrier disruption (BBBD) combined with intravenous carboplatin for the treatment of rGBM using the Exablate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 system with microbubble resonators. Adult glioblastoma subjects that are planned for carboplatin chemotherapy will be considered for study enrollment. Eligible subjects will undergo up to 6 cycles of Exablate BBBD procedures in conjunction with carboplatin chemotherapy.
