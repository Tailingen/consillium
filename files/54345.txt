Study to Demonstrate the Efficacy and Safety of Propranolol Oral Solution in Infants With Proliferating Infantile Hemangiomas Requiring Systemic Therapy
There is an unsatisfied medical need for a first-line treatment of proliferating IHs with a good benefit/risk profile. Based on the recent findings of encouraging results obtained with propranolol in a series of infants with severe Infantile Hemangioma (IH), propranolol is expected to be of significant benefit in the management of the condition. The present study has been designed to confirm efficacy of propranolol in severe IH by demonstrating superiority over placebo and to document the safety profile of propranolol in this indication.
Infantile Hemangioma
DRUG: Propranolol|DRUG: Placebo
Interim Analysis : Complete/Nearly Complete Resolution of the Target Infantile Hemangioma at Week 24 Compared to Baseline Based on the Intra-patient Blinded Centralized Independent Qualitative Assessments of Week 24 Photographs., 6 months|Primary Analysis : Complete/Nearly Complete Resolution of the Target Infantile Hemangioma at W24 Compared to Baseline Based on the Intra-patient Blinded Centralized Independent Qualitative Assessments of W24 Photographs., 6 months
Success/Failure Based on the Investigator Qualitative Assessment of Complete Resolution at W48., Time to first sustained improvement based on centralized qualitative assessments of paired patient-visits, 6 months
Primary objective The primary objective of this study is to identify the appropriate dose and duration of propranolol treatment and demonstrate its superiority over placebo based on the complete/nearly complete resolution of target IH at W24.
