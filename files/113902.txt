A Study of Nemtabrutinib vs Chemoimmunotherapy for Participants With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) Without TP53 Aberrations (MK-1026-008, BELLWAVE-008)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). CLL and SLL are types of blood cancer. Researchers want to know if people who take nemtabrutinib compared to those who take the standard treatments in this study will live longer without their cancer growing, spreading or returning (progression free survival).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Nemtabrutinib|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Bendamustine|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|BIOLOGICAL: Truxima|BIOLOGICAL: Ruxience|BIOLOGICAL: Riabni
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Criteria 2018 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is evaluated per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria 2018 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to approximately 49 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 94 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as Assessed by BICR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR), complete response with an incomplete recovery of the participant's bone marrow (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR), or Partial response (PR), per iwCLL criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrate a CR, CRi, nPR, or PR per iwCLL criteria as assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR that led to response until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 94 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 94 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 94 months
