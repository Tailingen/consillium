Focal Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer
This prospective registry and longitudinal study that is designed to carefully measure details of prostate cancer patients' outcomes with focal therapy. The goal of which is to improve patient care.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Focal Therapy
Oncological Response, The following definitions will be used for evaluation of oncological response:

Complete response: Ablation of prostate tissue in targeted biopsy cores at 12 months.

Incomplete response: Residual disease at 12 months compared to baseline in target biopsy cores or systematic biopsy cores., 1 year
Erectile Dysfunction, Assess impact on erections after ablation. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) questionnaire will be used to evaluate sexual health quality-of-life symptoms for participants pre- and post-ablation.

Patients will receive a score between 0 and 12, 0 being low with a better outcome and 12 being high with a worse outcome., 1 year|Incontinence, Assess impact on continence after ablation. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) questionnaire will be used to evaluate urinary health quality-of-life symptoms for participants pre- and post-ablation.

Patients will receive a score between 0 and 12, 0 being low with a better outcome and 12 being high with a worse outcome., 1 year|Prostate cancer recurrence. Patients will be monitored with a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) every 6 months until 10 years from the intervention. Patients with a rising PSA will receive a prostate biopsy to determine if they have a recurrence., Assess long-term recurrence risk after ablation, 10 years
This observational study will serve to collect data from medical record and review questionnaires before and after focal ablation of prostate tissue. All enrolled subjects will have already undergone or scheduled to receive the focal therapy as part of their prostate cancer treatment.
