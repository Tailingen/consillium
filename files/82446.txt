A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of KTN3379 in Adult Subjects With Advanced Tumors
Part I will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of KTN3379 over several doses with the objective of defining a Phase 2 dose in patients with advanced malignancies. Part II will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of KTN3379 in combination with other targeted agents and obtain preliminary evidence of anti tumor activity in specific types of cancer. Patients will continue receiving KTN3379 alone or in combination until disease progression or toxicity that necessitates discontinuation (whichever comes first).
