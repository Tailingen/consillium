Prostate Cancer Prospective Cohort
The overall purpose of this research is to determine if certain genes increase the chance of developing prostate cancer and once diagnosed increase the chance of the prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.
Prostate Cancer
Ability to recognize increased risk of metastatic prostate cancer based on specific genetic polymorphisms., At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis
Ability to predict risk for treatment failure based on analysis of specific polymorphisms., At the time of prostate cancer diagnosis
DNA will be isolated from each person and then studied for the presence of certain genes that may increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. Certain genes will also be studied in patients with known prostate cancer to determine if they increase the chance of cancer spreading to other parts of the body and decrease one's chance of being cured. Small differences in genes can slightly affect their ability to function. While these differences are normal, they may influence the way the cancer responds to therapy. An understanding of which genes increase (or decrease) the chance of being cured of a disease, such as prostate cancer, will improve our ability to take care of patients more effectively.

A second purpose of this study is to collect blood and cancer tissue for future studies. While the small differences in genes may be the best marker of bad cancer, it is also possible that proteins in blood or tumor may be a better marker.
