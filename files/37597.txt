Evaluation Of The Treatment Effectiveness Of Glioblastoma / Gliosarcoma Through The Suppression Of The PI3K/Akt Pathway In Compared With MK-3475
It is known that after application of MK-3475 activated PD -1 negatively regulates the activation of T cells through suppression of the path of PI3K / Akt.

This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).
Glioblastoma
DRUG: MK - 3475|BIOLOGICAL: Suppressor of the PI3K/Akt pathways
Progression Free Survival, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab among subjects with recurrent glioblastoma when treated with pembrolizumab (Cohort A), and when treated with inhibitors PI3K/Akt pathways monotherapy (Cohort B) as assessed by the 12-month progression-free survival (PFS-12) rate., Time Frame: 12 months
Safety and tolerability of Pembrolizumab (Assessed by reported adverse events using CTCAE version 4.0), Assesed by reported adverse events using CTCAE version 4.0. Progression Free Survival, Time Frame: 12 months
Safety and tolerability of inhibitors PI3K/Akt pathways as monotherapy (adverse events using CTCAE version 4.0), Assesed by reported adverse events using CTCAE version 4.0. Progression Free Survival, Time Frame: 12 months
A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).
