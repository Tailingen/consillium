A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Parallel-group, Phase III Study of the Efficacy and Safety of QL1701 Plus Docetaxel Versus Herceptin速 Plus Docetaxel as First Line Therapy in Patients With HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of QL1701 and Herceptin速 in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, locally recurrent or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.

This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of QL1701 and Herceptin速 in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, recurrent or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be assessed centrally for HER2 status and the presence of at least one measurable target lesion before randomization. Patients will undergo a tumor assessment for evaluation of response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks up to 24 weeks (regardless of the number of cycles actually given);
