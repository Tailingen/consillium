A Phase 2 Study Comparing TAS-102 Versus Topotecan or Amrubicin to Treat Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
The purpose of this trial is to compare the effects of TAS-102 with either amrubicin or topotecan (drugs used in Small Cell Lung Cancer) on lung cancer to find out the effects on survival, how much time may pass without disease progression, and the safety of TAS-102.
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
DRUG: TAS-102|DRUG: Amrubicin (Japan)|DRUG: Topotecan (Japan/Europe)
Progression-free survival, Tumor assessments will be performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 every 6 weeks during study treatment, and every 8 weeks after treatment is completed. Tumor assessments will be performed from Day 1, Cycle 1 until radiologic progression develops or the start of new anticancer treatment, for up to 12 months after the last patient is randomized or until the target number of events (deaths) is met., Every 6 weeks from the start of study treatment (Day 1, Cycle 1). Tumor assessments will be performed until radiologic progression develops or the start of new anticancer treatment.
Overall survival, Survival status will be collected at 8-week intervals until death, for up to 12 months after the first dose of study medication for the last patient randomized or until the target number of events (deaths) is met, whichever is later.|Safety monitoring including adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, Standard safety monitoring will be performed and adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, Through 30 days following last administration of study medication or until initiation of new anticancer treatment
This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, randomized Phase 2 study of TAS-102 versus Investigator's choice of therapy in patients requiring second-line chemotherapy for SCLC refractory or sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Investigator's choice of therapy is defined as second-line chemotherapy with IV topotecan (Europe/Japan) or IV amrubicin (Japan). Patients will be stratified by response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (sensitive vs refractory). Sensitive patients are defined as patients who did not progress within 90 days after the last dose, and refractory patients are defined as patients who never responded or who responded but had radiologic progression \< 90 days after the last dose.
