Tegio Consolidation Therapy for NPC Patients With High Risk of Metastasis
oral administration of Tegio capsules for 12 months for NPC patients with high risk of metastasis (AJCC stage T3-4N2M0 or T1-4N3M0) was tested trying to reduce distant metastasis，safety was also evaluated.

distant metastsis-free survival (DMFS), distant metastsis-free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented distant disease failure, assessed up to 36 months
In this study, NPC patients (stage T3-4N2M0 or T1-4N3M0) who finished the curative chemoradiation will be randomized to the observation group and treatment group (60 mg bid, p.o.，d1-28，q6wks; continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or over 1 year). The primary endpoint is distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxic effects,. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
