Evaluation of Stereotactic Radiosurgery For Liver Malignancies
This study is intended to establish the practicality of treating cancer in the liver with precisely administered single fractions of high-energy radiation using a radiosurgical (cross-firing) technique. A second purpose is to establish a safe dose for such therapy. Finally, the efficacy of radiosurgical ablation of liver tumors, in terms of radiographic response, will be measured.
