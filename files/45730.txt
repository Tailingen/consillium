Endoscopic Ethanol Ablation of Communicating Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms
Pancreatic cysts are common, and some pancreas cysts have malignant potential. Usual treatment of these cysts is either observation or surgical removal of part or all of the pancreas. Minimally invasive treatment via endoscopy has been described, using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided ethanol injections. Such studies exclude cysts that communicate with the main pancreatic duct, to avoid burning the main pancreatic duct with ethanol. In this study, pancreas cysts communicating with the main pancreas duct are treated with ethanol via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and/or EUS.
Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous|Pancreatic Neoplasms|Ultrasonography, Interventional
PROCEDURE: EUS and/or ERCP with ethanol injections of pancreatic cyst
Occurrence of adverse events requiring treatment or hospitalization, 3 days, 30 days|Decrease in volume of the pancreatic cyst by cross-sectional imaging studies (CT or MR) performed before and after treatment, 6 months, 12 months
Subjects will undergo EUS and/or ERCP as outpatients. For cysts shown to communicate with the main pancreas duct, a balloon catheter will be placed in the main pancreatic duct via ERCP. The balloon catheter will isolate the cyst from the main pancreatic duct, allowing ethanol injections of the cyst. A pancreatic duct stent will be placed in some patients, requiring repeat endoscopy for removal at another time.
