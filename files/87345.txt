Achieving Equity in Genomic Testing for Breast Cancer Through Partner-Led Strategies and Policies
The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers, and the extent of said barriers, to genomic testing for breast cancer patients among low-income and minority populations, particularly throughout Northern California. The investigators have created a survey that is available online for any patient with cancer to fill out voluntarily regarding their experiences to date. The survey is available at: https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7VElf8oesWcB3bE
Breast Cancer
Number of participants who fill out the survey and participate in the semi-structured interviews. [ Time Frame: 12 Months ], We will track the number of participants who fill out the survey for the 12 month duration of the study and the number of participants who participate in the semi-structured telephone interviews., 12 Months
The study has two main data-collecting phases. In phase 1, the investigators will engage multilevel stakeholders to respond to a survey assessing experience with and perceptions of genomic testing and its accessibility for patients with breast cancer in California. In phase 2, selected and interested survey participants who voluntarily provide their contact information on the survey will be asked to participate in an in-depth 1:1 semi-structured interview to explore disparities in genomic testing for breast cancer more closely. The investigators will then utilize their findings from both phases to present aggregate findings to an Expert Panel and Community Advisory Board and work together to develop policy recommendations. The policy recommendations will then be presented to policy makers, with the aim of identifying sustainable solutions that address breast cancer treatment and outcome disparities throughout Northern California.
