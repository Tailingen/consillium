Imgatuzumab in Patients With Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of imgatuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Quality of life of patients treated with imgatuzumab will also be assessed.
