Sequential Regimen of Bendamustin-Debulking Followed by Ofatumumab and Ibrutinib in CLL Patients (CLL2-BIO)
A prospective, open-label, multicentre phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential regimen of bendamustine followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib followed by ibrutinib and ofatumumab maintenance in CLL patients.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Ofatumumab|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients responding according to international working Group on chronic lymphocytic leukemia criteria, 84 days after first dose of last induction cycle
Safety: Adverse events (AEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), Type, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI) and their relationship to study treatment., up to 48 months after first dose of study drug|minimal residual disease (MRD), Rate of MRD responses in peripheral blood measured by immunophenotyping, up to 48 months after first dose of study drug
In the CLL2-BIO trial an allcomer CLL population with indication for treatment will be included.

Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustin unless contraindications are existing or debulking is not indicated. Afterwards 6 cycles of induction therapy with ofatumumab and ibrutinib will be applied, each with a duration of 28 days. Primary endpoint overall Response rate will be assessed at final restaging.

Patients benefitting from BIO treatment will enter the maintenance phase of the trial. Maintenance treatment will be continued if no unacceptable toxicity occurs until three months after negativity of minimal residual disease (MRD) is achieved in peripheral blood in patients with (clinical) complete response (CR) or (clinical) incomplete complete response (CRi) confirmed by 2 consecutive testings of MRD within 3 months, progression of CLL, start of a subsequent therapy or up to 8 cycles of maintenance (each cycle with a duration of 84 calendar days = 3 months), whichever occurs first.
