Deferoxamine for Iron Overload Before Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
The objective of this research study is to determine the safety and feasibility of chelation therapy with deferoxamine for patients with iron overload who are receiving a stem cell transplant. Patients who have iron overload prior to stem cell transplantation may have more toxicity from the transplantation procedure, and thus may benefit from an attempt at iron chelation pre- and peri-transplantation. In this study we are examining the use of deferoxamine starting 2 weeks to 3 months prior to transplantation and continuing through the preparative regimen.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: deferoxamine
Safety of Deferoxamine Therapy Determined by the Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Toxicities., All patients meeting the criteria for Severe iron overload as defined by BOTH:

ferritin ≥ 1000 ng/ml and liver iron content(LIC) ≥ 5 mg/gdw were enrolled and received chelation therapy with Deferoxamine. All patients who received chelation therapy were monitored for grade 3 or above toxicity Attributable to Deferoxamine(grades defined by the CTCAE Version 3). The number of participants with grade 3 or higher toxicities were measured and used to determine the safety of chelation therapy., Baseline , 6 month, 1 year
1-year Post-Transplant Survival, Survival information for the 5 patients who were treated with deferoxamine was collected. This information was used to determine transplant-related mortality, relapse, disease-free and overall survival., 1 year
