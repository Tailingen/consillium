Redifferentiation Therapy Using Alpha Lipoic Acid in Thyroid Cancer
Radioiodine (I-131) therapy is of proven efficacy for treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). However, loss of differentiation in recurrent or metastatic DTC which decrease I-131 uptake may decrease the efficacy of I-131 therapy. Therefore, strategies to improve I-131 uptake are mandatory. This study is an open label clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) for improving I-131 uptake in recurrent or metastatic of DTC with defective I-131 uptake.
