AZD9291 First Time In Patients Ascending Dose Study
This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumour has started to re-grow following that treatment. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further clinical trials will be selected.

DRUG: AZD9291
Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Dose Expansion Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (by investigator assessment) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 21 months (at time of analysis)|Best Objective Response (BOR) for Dose Escalation Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. Not evaluable (NE): TL response is missing and there is no evidence of progression of NTLs and no new lesions. BOR is the best response (by investigator assessment) a patient has achieved where the order of best to worst is CR, PR, SD, PD, NE prior to or at progression and prior to further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 25 months (at time of analysis)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Extension Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (by independent central review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 12 months (at the time of analysis)
Duration of Response (DoR) for Dose Expansion Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed) until the date of documented progression (PD) or death in the absence of disease progression (by investigator assessment)., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 21 months (at time of analysis)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for Dose Expansion Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. PFS is the time from date of first dose until the date of PD (by independent central review) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from AZD9291 therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 21 months (at time of analysis)|Best Objective Response (BOR) for 80mg AZD9291 Extension Population, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. Not evaluable (NE): TL response is missing and there is no evidence of progression of NTLs and no new lesions. BOR is the best response (by investigator assessment) a patient has achieved where the order of best to worst is CR, PR, SD, PD, NE prior to or at progression and prior to further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation until objective disease progression, up to approximately 12 months (at the time of analysis)
