Lung Cancer Screening Program in Mexico
This prospective study aims to detect early-stage lung cancer using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in Mexicans aged 50 or older who are current or former heavy smokers, non-smokers exposed to significant wood smoke, or diagnosed with COPD. Annual LDCT, spirometry, and serum biomarker tests will be conducted over 3 years, and a follow-up lasting up to 10 years.

OTHER: Screening
Lung cancer incidence in Mexican population, Assess the number of lung cancer detections after each round of screening., Annually over 3-year from inclusion
Lung cancer survival, Assess lung cancer mortality in participants included in the screening protocol and outside the protocol., 10-year follow-up or death from lung cancer|All-cause mortality, Asses all-cause mortality related to risk factors at the 3-years of LDCT screening and follow-up, 10-year follow-up or death from lung cancer
Lung cancer clinical stage, Assess stage of the disease in patients detected by LDCT screening program, Annually over 3-year from inclusion|Serum immunological biomarkers, Assess Inflammatory cytokines, Annually over 3-year from inclusion|Nodule detection rate, Assess nodule detection rate, characteristics and outcomes detected at the screening protocol., Annually over 3-year from inclusion|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) incidence rate, Detect participants with a positive spirometry test that covers COPD diagnosis, Annually over 3-year from inclusion|Anxiety/Depression rate, Asses psychological diagnosis (anxiety/depression) related to a lung cancer screening program., Annually over 3-year from inclusion
This prospective cohort study aims to detect lung cancer in early stages using LDCT scans in Mexican individuals aged 50 years or older. Eligible participants comprise current smokers with a history of â‰¥ 20 pack-years, former smokers who have quit within the past 15 years, non-smokers exposed to wood smoke more than 100 hours/year, or patients diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

Secondary objectives include assessing the 10-year mortality rate, the association of lung cancer with immunologic biomarkers, the demographic characterization of participants, the psychological impact of an LC screening program, the histological profiling of positive cases, lung function changes in at-risk individuals, and the clinical staging distribution at diagnosis.

The study will conduct annual LDCT scans, lung function tests (spirometry), anxiety and depression assessments, and serum biomarkers tests over 3 years. Positive LDCT results will adhere to LUNG-RADS guidelines and be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Prevention strategies, including tobacco cessation treatments, will be provided. Follow-up will continue for 5 and 10 years or until an event of completion occurs (cancer diagnosis, end of follow-up, or death).
