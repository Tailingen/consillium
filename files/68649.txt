Survival in a Randomized Phase III Trial in Patients With Limited Disease (LD) Small Cell Lung Cancer Vaccinated With Adjuvant BEC2 and BCG
This trial is designed to test the impact of adjuvant BEC2 (2.5 mg)/BCG vaccination on survival in patients with LD Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Patients will be stratified by institution, KPS (60 - 70% vs 80 - 100%), and response to first line combined modality therapy (CR vs PR) that consisted of at least a 2 drug regimen (4 - 6 cycles) and a chest radiotherapy regimen. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: standard arm (Observational cohort) or best supportive care, or the treatment arm (5 intradermal vaccinations of BEC2 (2.5 mg) + BCG given on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10.
