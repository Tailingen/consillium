Pilot Study of Reduced Intensity Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Poor Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) Utilising Conditioning With Fludarabine, Busulphan and Thymoglobulin
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of conditioning with fludarabine, busulphan and thymoglobuline in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders (MDS/MPD) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell allograft with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (or bone marrow) from HLA compatible sibling donors.
