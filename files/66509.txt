Pilot Study of Performance Status 2 vs. Performance Status 0-1 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Chemo/Immunotherapy
This pilot study is configured as a non-inferiority comparison of Performance Status 2 patients with Performance Status 0-1 patients, with the goal of demonstrating non-inferiority in terms of efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety (rates of adverse events, quality of life) when treating Performance Status 2 patients with the same first-line immunotherapy-based regimen as Performance Status 0-1 patients.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer|Performance Status
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|OTHER: Quality of Life Questionnaire, lung cancer-specific (QLQ-LC13)|OTHER: QLQ-C30 Global Health/Quality of Life Questionnaire|OTHER: COPD Assessment Test and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Patient Reported Outcomes|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Proportion of Participants with Progression-Free Survival, Using non-blinded central imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 to define progressive disease., From baseline to end of 4th cycle of treatment (12 weeks)
Incidences of Grade 3 to Grade 5 Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Adverse events will be defined using CTCAE Version 5.0 after four cycles (12 weeks)., 12 weeks|Change in Overall Quality of Life/Global Health Status - EORTC QLQ-C30, Using the total score of the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a 30-item questionnaire for functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), global health status and quality of life scale, also several single-item symptom measures. Scoring scale : 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much), 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent). Minimum score 0, maximum score 100. For functional and global quality of life scales, higher scores mean a better level of functioning. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms., From baseline to end of 4th cycle of treatment (12 weeks)|Proportion of Participants with Deterioration in Symptoms - QLQ-LC13, Patient reported deterioration in three symptoms: Cough, chest pain, or dyspnea as measured by the symptoms scales as part of the Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13). Deterioration is defined as a 10-point or greater decrease from baseline in either cough, chest pain, or dyspnea and subsequently confirmed by a second adjacent 10-point or greater decrease from baseline in the same symptom), From baseline to end of 4th cycle of treatment (12 weeks)
Primary Objective: To demonstrate that proportion of Performance Status 2 participants with progression-free survival at 12 weeks is not inferior to the corresponding proportion of Performance Status 0-1 patients.

Secondary Objective(s)

* To demonstrate that incidence of treatment-related adverse events at 12 weeks in the Performance Status 2 group is not higher than that occurring in the Performance Status 0-1 groups.
* To demonstrate that change in overall quality of life/global health status at 12 weeks is not inferior in the Performance Status 2 group compared to the change in the Performance Status 0-1 group.
* To demonstrate that proportion of participants with deterioration in lung-cancer specific symptoms at 12 weeks in the Performance Status 2 group is not higher than the corresponding proportion in the Performance Status 0-1 group.
