Study of Magrolimab Combinations in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about the safety and dosing of the study drug, magrolimab, in combination with other anticancer therapies in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Magrolimab|DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Carfilzomib
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity or Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity, that had worsened in severity from pretreatment baseline during the DLT assessment period and, in the opinion of the investigator, the adverse event (AE) was at least possibly related to magrolimab.

Percentages are rounded off., Up to 35 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE's) According to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a study drug that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not the AE is considered related to the study drug. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as any AE that began on or after the date of first dose of any study drug up to the date of last dose of any study drug plus 70 days., Up to 1.3 years plus 70 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Laboratory Abnormalities According to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline at any postbaseline time point, up to and included the date of last dose of study drug plus 70 days for participants who permanently discontinued study drug, or the day before initiation of new anticancer therapy including stem cell transplant (SCT) (whichever was earlier). If the relevant baseline laboratory value was missing, any abnormality of at least Grade 1 observed within the time frame specified above was considered treatment emergent.

Percentages are rounded off., Up to 1.3 years plus 70 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve confirmed stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR), as assessed by the investigator per the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria. CR defined as negative immunofixation on serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM) aspirates; sCR defined as CR as above plus normal serum free light-chain (FLC) assay ratio and absence of clonal cells in BM biopsy by immunohistochemistry; VGPR defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 h; PR defined as ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 h.

Percentages are rounded off., Up to 1.5 years
Duration of Response (DoR), DoR was measured from earliest date of sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR, whichever was first recorded, until earliest date of documented progression disease (PD) per IMWG 2016, documented relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR are defined in outcome measure #4. PD is having any 1 or more of following criteria: increase of 25% from lowest confirmed response value; increase between involved and uninvolved FLC levels \>10 mg/dL; increase in BM plasma-cell ≥10%; appearance of new lesion, ≥ 50% increase in sum of products of 2 longest perpendicular diameters of \>1 lesion, or ≥ 50% increase in longest diameter of a previous lesion \>1 cm in short axis; ≥ 50% increase in circulating plasma cells. Relapse is new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions; increase in size of existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions; hypercalcemia (\> 11 mg/dL); decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL; rise in serum creatinine by 2 mg/dL; hyperviscosity. Kaplan Meier estimates were used., Up to 1.5 years|Serum Concentration of Magrolimab, Arm 1: Magrolimab+Daratumumab; Arm 2: Magrolimab+Pomalidomide+Dexamethasone; Arm 3: Magrolimab+Carfilzomib+Dexamethasone., Arm 1, 2, 3: Predose: Days 1 and 22 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and on last sample collection day (anytime; up to Day 358); Arm 1 and 3: Predose: Day 1 of Cycles 10 and 13|Percentage of Participants With Positive Anti-magrolimab Antibodies, The percentage of participants who had treatment induced or treatment-boosted anti-drug antibody (ADA) based on participants who had non-missing baseline ADA sample and at least one post-treatment ADA result reported in Immunogenicity Analysis Set. Treatment-Induced ADA: participants who had negative baseline ADA sample and at least one positive post-treatment ADA sample based on participants who had both non-missing baseline and at least one post-treatment ADA result reported. Treatment-Boosted ADA: participants who had positive baseline ADA sample and at least one positive post-treatment ADA sample and the (max titer of the posttreatment ADA) / (titer of baseline ADA) \>= 4., Up to Day 358
