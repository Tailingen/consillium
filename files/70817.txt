IPH5201 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Durvalumab +/- Oleclumab in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors.
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the dose of IPH5201 that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab +/- oleclumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: IPH5201|BIOLOGICAL: durvalumab|BIOLOGICAL: oleclumab
Incidence of adverse events as a measure of safety, The primary endpoint is safety as assessed by the presence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)., From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up 12 weeks after last dose of investigational product, approximately 7 months|Incidence of clinically significant laboratory values as a measure of safety, Number of subjects with clinically significant laboratory values from baseline including blood counts, liver, kidney and pancreas tests, electrolytes, and blood clotting., From time of informed consent through 12 weeks after the last dose of investigational product, approximately 7 months|Incidence of clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities as a measure of safety, 12 lead ECGs will be measured to identify clinical significant abnormalities including ECGs that demonstrate a QTcF value \>500ms, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a 30 minute time period to confirm prolongation based on the average QTcF value, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up period 12 weeks after last dose of investigational product, approximatley 7 months
