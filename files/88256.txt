Comparing Carbon Ion Therapy, Surgery, and Proton Therapy for Management of Pelvic Sarcomas Involving the Bone
This study compares carbon ion therapy, surgery, and proton therapy to determine if one has better disease control and fewer side effects. There are three types of radiation treatment used for pelvic bone sarcomas: surgery with or without photon/proton therapy, proton therapy alone, and carbon ion therapy alone. The purpose of this study is to compare quality of life among patients treated for pelvic bone sarcomas across the world, and to determine if carbon ion therapy improves quality of life compared to surgery and disease control compared with proton therapy.

Average difference in change of functional quality of life (QOL), Will be compared between patients who received carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) and surgery utilizing a one-sided test for a two sample t-test for independent means. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 functional score will be calculated and median, mean, and 95% confidence interval will be computed for each arm, with one-sided two-sample t-tests conducted between the surgery +/- radiation therapy (RT) and CIRT arm., Baseline (pre-treatment) to 1 year after completion of treatment|Proportion of patients experiencing local control, Will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals with a one-sided test for non-inferiority to be conducted between the PT and CIRT arms., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Progression-free survival - local control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including local control as well as progression-free survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Progression-free survival - regional control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including regional control as well as progression-free survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Progression-free survival - distant control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including distant control as well as progression-free survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Overall survival - local control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including local control as well as overall survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Overall survival - regional control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including regional control as well as overall survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Overall survival - distant control, The Kaplan-Meier method with likelihood ratio tests will be used to calculate clinical outcomes including distant control as well as overall survival for each arm and stratified by arm., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment
Secondary and exploratory analyses on toxicity data, Secondary and exploratory analyses on data will be conducted utilizing standard logistic regression analysis for acute (\< 6 months) and late (\> 6 months) toxicity., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Secondary and exploratory analyses on dose volume histogram (DVH) data, Secondary and exploratory analyses on data will be conducted utilizing standard logistic regression analysis for acute (\< 6 months) and late (\> 6 months) toxicity., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Dose volume histogram, Secondary and exploratory analyses on toxicity and DVH data will be conducted utilizing standard logistic regression analysis for acute (\< 6 months) and late (\> 6 months) toxicity. Receiver-operator curves and area-under-the curve will be computed separately for each DVH metric to determine the effect on toxicity, QOL, local control and survival., Up to 5 years after completion of treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Demonstrate whether carbon ion therapy provides improved patient reported health related quality of life (PRO-HRQOL) outcomes and less significant toxicities compared with surgery.

II. Demonstrate whether carbon ion therapy provides improved local control versus proton therapy.

OUTLINE:

Patients complete quality of life questionnaires over 20 minutes at baseline (before any therapy), 2-4 and 5-9 months after completion of therapy, and then annually for up to 5 years. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.
