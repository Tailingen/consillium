Preoperative Pain Control in Liver Surgery Patients
Pregabalin 150mg or placebo are administered 1 hour preoperatively in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy. Postoperatively, patients receive morphine as rescue analgesic. Morphine consumption in the first 48 hours is documented. Postoperative pain is measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) score.
Pain, Postoperative|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Pregabalin|DRUG: Placebo (for Pregabalin)
Postoperative Opioid Consumption, 48 hours
Postoperative Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale, 24 hours
Methods: In this Randomized Controlled Trial, patients undergoing partial hepatectomy will be administered a single pre-operative dose of Pregabalin or a placebo. Primary endpoints are as follows:

* Post-operative analgesic requirements
* Post-operative VAS scale (rated 0-10)
* Complications
* Post-operative antiemetic requirement
* Length of stay
