Iodine Nutrition Status and Clinical Characteristics of Thyroid Cancer
The effect of iodine nutritional status on thyroid cancer has been controversial for many years. We designed a prospective cohort study that recruiting patients in different iodine areas who underwent thyroid cancer surgery in branch hospitals from 2012 to 2019ï¼Œand follow up their clinical outcomes. We aimed to analyse the relationship between regional iodine nutrition level and pathological types, clinical features, and prognosis of thyroid cancer.
Thyroid Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Iodine excess|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Iodine suitable
Number of participants with recurrence, Recurrence: diagnosed as the same type of thyroid cancer again by pathology, from enrollment to the final follow-up at 5 years|Number of participants with distant metastasis, Distant metastasis: Pathological confirmed thyroid cancer occurring outside the thyroid gland, from enrollment to the final follow-up at 5 years|All-cause mortality, The ratio of the total number of deaths caused by various reasons during the research period to the number of participants, from enrollment to the final follow-up at 5 years
Three sub centers were selected in high iodine (Jining/Liaocheng/Heze) and moderate iodine (Jinan/Shenyang/Haerbin) areas respectively. Patients lived in the above-mentioned regions for at least 5 years and diagnosed as thyroid cancer and underwent thyroid surgery in branch hospitals from 2012 to 2019 were recruited.
