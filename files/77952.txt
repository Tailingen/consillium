Performance of SYMMCORA® vs. V-Loc® Suture Material in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Total Hysterectomy
The aim of this study is to show the superiority of the new unidirectional barbed suture (SYMMCORA® mid-term, unidirectional) to conventional suture material in terms of time to perform the vaginal cuff closure during gynecologic surgeries without an increase in the complication rate.

Secondly, the superiority of SYMMCORA®, mid-term unidirectional compared to the V-Loc®, unidirectional will be assessed regarding the mean time to close the vaginal cuff. The study will be performed in routine clinical setting, the only difference will be the randomization into two different suture groups. Both suture materials which will be applied to approximate the vaginal cuff are approved and carrying the CE-marks. Additionally, both sutures will be applied in their intended use. Neither additional invasive measures nor additional burden in regard to the patient will be performed.

DEVICE: Closure of the Vaginal Cuff after Total Hysterectomy
Suturing time to close the vaginal cuff, Measured in Minutes. Time to perform the vaginal cuff closure after laparoscopic total hysterectomy using a stop watch. Time starts when the needle passes the first time the tissue and ends after completion of the wound closure (cut of the needle from the thread)., intraoperatively

(Days of postoperative bleeding, Number of pads / tampons used), Vaginal bleeding (Defined as postoperative vaginal stump bleeding that required additional stump suture to stop bleeding. (Days of postoperative bleeding, number of pads / tampons used), Urinary tract infection, Bladder injury, Ureter injury, Bowel obstruction, Ileus, Cystitis and Pelvic Adhesions., at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Number of patients with device deficiencies over the study period, Documented device deficiencies include Suture rupture, Knots in the thread, Connection between needle and thread not intact and Disconnection of the anchor from the thread, intraoperatively, at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Patient satisfaction (VAS 0-100) over time, The patient's self assessment of her satisfaction with the surgery. This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), represented by a line 10 cm of length, which states "0" at one end representing "low" and "100" at the opposite end representing "high". The value is measured in \[mm\] with a ruler and documented in whole numbers., at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Progress of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) compared to baseline, The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item, self-report measure of female sexual function that provides scores on overall levels of sexual function as well as the primary components of sexual function in women, including sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction. The 19 items of the FSFI use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1-5 with higher scores indicating greater levels of sexual functioning on the respective item. (0 points in some cases for items that are not applicable). To score the measure, the sum of each domain score is first multiplied by a domain factor ratio (0.6 for desire; 0.3 for arousal and lubrication; 0.4 for orgasm, satisfaction and pain) in order to place all domain totals on a more comparable scale, and then subsequently summed to derive a total FSFI score. The domain scores range from 1.2 - 6, the overall score ranges from 7.2 - 36., Preoperatively (baseline), at follow-up visits 6-8 weeks postoperatively and 6 months postoperatively|Overall operation time, From the first cut to the end of the surgery, intraoperatively|Cost of treatment, Calculation using the length of hospitalization (days until discharge), suturing time, suture costs and needed transfusions), at discharge (approximately 10 days after surgery)|Length of postoperative hospital stay, calculated by subtracting the surgery date from the date of discharge, at discharge (approximately 10 days after surgery)|Progress of Patient's abdominal pain (VAS 0-100) compared to baseline, The patient's self assessment of her abdominal pain. This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), represented by a line 10 cm of length, which states "0" at one end representing "no pain" and "100" at the opposite end representing "heavy pain". The value is measured in \[mm\] with a ruler and documented in whole numbers, preoperatively (baseline) and at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Progress of Patient's pelvic pain (VAS 0-100) compared to baseline, The patient's self assessment of her pelvic pain. This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), represented by a line 10 cm of length, which states "0" at one end representing "no pain" and "100" at the opposite end representing "heavy pain". The value is measured in \[mm\] with a ruler and documented in whole numbers, preoperatively (baseline) and at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Progress of Patient's lumbar pain (VAS 0-100) compared to baseline, The patient's self assessment of her lumbar pain. This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), represented by a line 10 cm of length, which states "0" at one end representing "no pain" and "100" at the opposite end representing "heavy pain". The value is measured in \[mm\] with a ruler and documented in whole numbers, preoperatively (baseline) and at discharge (up to 10 days after surgery), 6-8 weeks postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively|Progress of General Health Status compared to baseline, The patient's self assessment of her general health status.
