Genetic Analysis-Guided Dosing of FOLFIRABRAX in Treating Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of genetic analysis-guided dosing of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRABRAX) in treating patients with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Genetic analysis may help doctors determine what dose of irinotecan hydrochloride patients can tolerate.

DLT rate in course 1 for each of the three genotype groups, graded according to NCI CTCAE v 4.0, 4 weeks
Incidence of adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE v 4.0, Adverse events will be summarized by type, grade, and attribution., Up to 6 months|Response rates (by RECIST 1.1) for patients with each different type of gastrointestinal malignancy, These results will be compared descriptively to appropriate historical controls. Exact 90% confidence intervals will be generated for the response rates., Up to 6 months|Cumulative doses of the drugs will be calculated as the sum of all doses received on protocol therapy for each patient, The means and standard deviations for patients in each genotype group will be reported., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate in cycle #1 in each of three uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype groups (\*1/\*1, \*1/\*28, \*28/\*28) using genotype-guided dosing of irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) as part of the FOLFIRABRAX regimen.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the cumulative dose of each chemotherapy drug (nab-paclitaxel \[paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation\], irinotecan, 5-FU \[fluorouracil\]) administered in each genotype group.

II. To determine the response rates (in patients with measurable disease) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) for each different disease (pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, esophageal/gastric cancer, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary) treated in the study.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive FOLFIRABRAX comprising paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 0.5 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1.5 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
