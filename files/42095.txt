A Study Comparing Immunotherapy With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Elderly Patients With Advanced NSCLC (MILES-5)
This is a randomized phase 2 trial aiming to assess the early efficacy of two experimental treatment sequences.

Three arms are planned; (i) standard chemotherapy followed at progression by single agent immunotherapy with durvalumab (CT), (ii) experimental single agent immunotherapy with durvalumab followed at progression by chemotherapy, (iii) experimental combination immunotherapy with durvalumab+tremelimumab followed at progression by chemotherapy.

The the two experimental strategies will be compared with the standard strategy in terms of 12-month overall survival, time considered informative for the type of treatment and disease
