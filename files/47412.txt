Efficacy Study of Long-term Parenteral Nutrition With SmofKabiven速 E in Lung Cancer Patients Under Anticancer Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of long-term addition of SmofKabiven速 E to normal oral nutrition after routine dietary counseling as compared to standard of care nutrition in which oral nutrition is the primary nutritional support. It takes place in lung cancer patients under chemo- and/or immunotherapy. Efficacy will be determined primarily by calculating the change of patient's body weight from before start of study treatment to end of treatment, and comparing this change between both treatment groups.
