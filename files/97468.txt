Study of Everolimus in Patients With Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma Previously Treated With Chemotherapy
Given the high expression of IGF-1R and pAKT proteins in thymoma tissues, able to sensitize tumors to mTOR inhibition, and the anticancer activity of the mTOR inhibitors, clinical evaluation in thymoma and thymic carcinoma seems to be very interesting.

Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral everolimus 10 mg once daily.

Efficacy and safety profile of Everolimus will be evaluated.
Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma
DRUG: Everolimus
disease control rate, disease control rate (DCR), considered as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) plus stable disease (SD), of Everolimus monotherapy, 6 months
PFS, Progression free survival (PFS) will be evaluated from the date of treatment start until the date of progression or death whichever occurs first, otherwise until the last visit date., 6 months|Duration of Response, This endpoint is assessed in patients whose best tumor response is CR or PR as the time from the date of the first documentation of confirmed objective tumor response to the date of first documentation of objective tumor progression, objective tumor recurrence, or of death due progressive disease, whichever comes first, 6 months|OS, Overall Survival (OS) will be evaluated from the date of treatment start until the date of death or last contact for patients alive at the end of the study., 6 months|FDG-PET imaging relations, To correlate response to therapy with changes in FDG-PET imaging at baseline and first restaging., 6 weeks|safety profile, Overall safety profile, evaluated on the basis of laboratory and clinical safety parameters, 6 months|biomarkers expression, To perform immunohistochemistry for IGF-1R, pAKT ,mTOR, p-S6K, p-S6, p-4E-BP1, and pTEN expression in all pre-treatment tissue specimens of thymoma and thymic carcinoma and correlate with response and survival (PFS and OS)., 6 months
Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral everolimus 10 mg once daily. Study drug will be self-administered orally (two 5 mg tablets) daily in a fasting state or with a light fat-free meal. Each cycle will be considered as 21 days of treatment; safety was assessed every 21 days. Tumor assessement will be done every two cycles. Treatment should be administered until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.
