Safety and PK Study of CC-90003 in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
The CC-90003-ST -001 trial is a first-in-man, open-label study in subjects with locally-advanced or wide spread cancers to determine if CC-90003 (an oral medication) can be adequately tolerated with minimal side effects.

Summary of the adverse events (type, severity, and incidence) related to CC-, An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.

Response Rate based on RECIST 1.1, The proportion of subjects who achieve a best response of CR or PR., Up to 36 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is the time from the start of study treatment until the first documentation of an objective response (either CR or PR)., Up to 36 months|Disease Control, The proportion of subjects who achieve a best response of SD (documented at least 56 days after the start of study treatment) PR, or CR, Up to 36 Months|Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until progression (PD) or patient death (any cause), whichever occurs first, Up to 36 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from start of study treatment until the date of death from any cause., Up to 36 months
CC-90003-ST -001 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a study in subjects with locally-advanced or metastatic, solid tumors who are intolerant of, resistant to, or have relapsed after at least one line of therapy and for whom no standard therapy exists. The study will be conducted in two parts: Dose Escalation (Part 1) and Cohort Expansion (Part 2). Subjects may continue CC-90003 until progression of their underlying malignancy, the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003. In Part 1, cohorts of subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors will receive increasing doses of CC-90003 in order to assess its safety and tolerability, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and PK profile. In Part 2, cohorts of subjects with specific tumors that harbor mutations involving the Mitogen -Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway will receive CC-90003 at or below the MTD until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003.
