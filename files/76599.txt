Immune Combined Targeted and Chemotherapy in Perioperative Treatment of Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
An exploratory study of pembrolizumab combined with anlotinib and chemotherapy in the perioperative treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Penpulimab combination with anlotinib and chemotherapy
Pathological complete response, pCR, Defined as tumor tissue specimens resected surgically after neoadjuvant therapy with no residual tumor cells., 12months
major pathologic response, MPR, Defined as tumor specimens resected after neoadjuvant therapy with residual tumor cells â‰¤10%, 12months
Previous studies have shown that anti-vascular drugs have excellent anti-tumor effects in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer with Penpulimab combined with anlotinib and chemotherapy. pathological complete response rate, disease-free survival, objective response rate, R0 resection rate and safety. The subjects used in the study were patients with resectable or potentially resectable T3\~4N+M0 gastric cancer who were confirmed by endoscopic ultrasonography and enhanced CT. The specific dosing schedule of Piamprimab combined with anlotinib and chemotherapy was adopted. After receiving the corresponding neoadjuvant therapy for 3 cycles, surgery should be performed within 3-6 weeks after drug withdrawal; it is recommended that patients be given corresponding Adjuvant therapy, the specific adjuvant therapy plan shall be formulated by the investigator according to the individual situation of the patient. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response rate, and secondary key indicators were disease-free survival, objective response rate, R0 resection rate, and safety.
