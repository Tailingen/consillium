Oral Azacitidine in Transplant-Eligible Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Suffering From Health-Inequality
Test feasibility of an oral maintenance strategy for transplant eligible AML patients in first CR who are medically underserved or have a disadvantage in the CDC SDOH domains
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Oral Azacitidine
Rate of completion of at least 4 cycles an oral maintenance strategy for transplant eligible AML patients in CR who are medically underserved or have a disadvantage in the CDC SDOH domains, The number of participants that complete at least four cycles of protocol therapy, 4 months
Overall survival (OS), Number of participants alive at relapse, completion of treatment or removal from study., 3 months, and up to 2 years|Leukemia Free Survival (LFS) 3 months after beginning of treatment and at relapse, completion of treatment or removal from study, Number of participants still in remission 3 months after beginning of treatment and at relapse, completion of treatment or removal from study, 3 months, and up to 2 years|Measure rates of measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity, The number of participants that have negative measurable residual disease (MRD) at 3 months after beginning of treatment, and completion of treatment. MRD will be measured by flow cytometry and by pathologic complete response (PCR) based molecular assay if/when target gene is available on diagnostic specimen., 3 months, and up to 2 years
This is a non-randomized open-label single institution pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of maintenance oral azacitidine in medically transplant eligible non-FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated AML patients with a disadvantage in at least 1 of the 5 key Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined social determinants of health (SDOH) domains that are preclusive to transplant at time of study enrollment, as identified either by the patient or a member of the healthcare team.
