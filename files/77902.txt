IN10018 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma
This is a phase Ib, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and antitumor activities of IN10018 as monotherapy and in combination with cobimetinib in subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma and NRAS-mutant metastatic melanoma.

To explore potential predictive biomarkers, in all 3 parts, through study completion, an average of 5 year
Subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) or with NRAS-mutant metastatic melanoma will be enrolled.

IN10018 will be assessed firstly as monotherapy（Part 1）, then in combination with cobimetinib (Part 2) and in combination with cobimetinib and Atezolizumab (Part 3).
