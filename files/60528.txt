Participants with Dose-limiting toxicities, Measuring the number of patients Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). A DLT is defined as any of the following events that are not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes:

Hematologic toxicities

* Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased lasting \>7 days
* Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia of any duration
* Grade ≥3 platelet count decreased with clinically significant hemorrhage
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting \>7 days Nonhematologic toxicities
* Death not clearly related to disease progression or extraneous cause
* Hy's law cases
* Grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicities, 1 Year|Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Measuring the number of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 1 Year|To determine the MTD if reached or MAD and two or more RDEs of BL-M17D1, MTD, MAD, and RDE, 1 Year
BL-M17D1-ST-101 is a multicenter, Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and initial efficacy of BL-M17D1 in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing or HER2-mutant solid tumors. This study will be conducted in three parts (dose escalation, dose finding and dose expansion). BL-M17D1 will be administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of a continuous 21-day treatment cycle.
