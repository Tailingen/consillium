Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors With Claudin18.2CAR-T
The efficacy of advanced pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer needs to be further improved. Claudin is a kind of integrin membrane protein in the tight junction between epithelium and endothelium, which is highly expressed in gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that Claudin18.2CAR-T can effectively improve the remission rate of patients with advanced solid tumors.

Claudin is a kind of integrin membrane protein in the tight junction between epithelium and endothelium, which is highly expressed in gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that Claudin18.2CAR-T can effectively improve the remission rate of patients with advanced solid tumors.

Investigators aim to testify to the safety and efficacy of Claudin18.2CAR-T cells in advanced pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer.
