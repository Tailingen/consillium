Copper Cu-64 TP3805 PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Urothelial Cancer Undergoing Surgery or Biopsy
This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu-64 TP3805 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with urothelial cancer undergoing surgery or biopsy. Radioactive tracers, such as copper Cu-64 TP3805, may bind to tumor cells. PET/CT imaging performed with copper Cu-64 TP3805 may be a better way to detect urothelial cancer.

DRUG: Copper Cu 64 TP3805|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography
Feasibility of Cu-64-TP3805 to detect UC as determined by post-surgical histology, For imaging, positive lesions will be deemed those which shall have standard uptake volume of 1.1 or greater. The results shall be correlated with post-surgical histology, Up to 4 weeks post-intervention
Blood clearance defined as the point at which radioactivity decreases to 50% of the initial value, The blood clearance time from all subjects shall be averaged with standard error of the mean., Up to 120 minutes post injection|Radioactivity internalization of copper Cu 64 TP3805 as analyzed in centrifuged urine samples, Radioactivity associated with supernatant containing cell cytoplasmic component to and cell membrane button shall be counted and their respective percentage shall be determined., Up to 120 minutes post injection
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if copper Cu-64 TP3805 (Cu-64-TP3805) shall image urothelial carcinoma (UC) as confirmed by postsurgical or biopsy histology.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine blood clearance of Cu-64-TP3805. II. To determine in vivo stability of Cu-64-TP3805.

TERTIARY:

I. To determine if Cu-64-TP3805 is bound to malignant cells and if it is internalized.
