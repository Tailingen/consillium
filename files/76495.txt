Patient Activation Through Counseling, Exercise and Mobilization
PACE-Mobil-PBL is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The aim is to investigate the effect of a multimodal and exercise-based intervention among older patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, or lung cancer during treatment with first-line palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

The hypotheses: That the multimodal intervention will increase or maintain physical function levels and strength, reduce symptoms and side-effects, improve quality of life, reduce treatment-related complications and hospital admissions, and reduce risk of cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.
