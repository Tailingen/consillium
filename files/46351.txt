VGX-3100 and Electroporation in Treating Patients With HIV-Positive High-Grade Anal Lesions
This phase II trial studies the use of human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmids therapeutic vaccine VGX-3100 (VGX-3100) and electroporation in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive high-grade anal lesions. Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Electroporation helps pores in your body's cells take in the drug to strengthen your immune system's response. Giving VGX-3100 and electroporation together may work better in treating patients with high-grade anal lesions.
