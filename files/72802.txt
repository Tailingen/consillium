Single-center, Prospective Study on the Identification and Delineation of Brain and Lung Tumors and At-Risk Organs, and Functional Testing of Surrounding Tissues Based on Dual-Energy CT
This study explored the feasibility of dual-energy CT in head and lung tumors. Dual-energy CT can achieve quantitative CT imaging based on traditional imaging by dual-energy spectral imaging, and enhance the clarity of head and lung tumors. In this study, we will prospectively explore the image accuracy and delineation accuracy of dual energy CT in radiotherapy to verify whether dual energy CT performs better with conventional CT.
