Cancer Communication Within Hispanic Social Networks
This trial examines cancer communication within Hispanic social networks. Hispanics have the lowest colorectal cancer screening rate of any major ethnic group and health interventions are crucially needed among Hispanics. Patient decision aids are health communication interventions designed to provide patients with targeted health information and have shown to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among Hispanics. The goal of this study is to investigate, in a sample of Hispanics, how a colorectal cancer decision aid aimed at increasing individuals' colorectal cancer screening behavior has effects on their alters' intention to get screened for colorectal cancer.
