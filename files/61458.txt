Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel Followed by Epirubicin in Combination With Cyclophosphamide in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, single arm, two-stage Simon Design study for women with Triple Negative Breast Cancer treated with Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel and Carboplatin.

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate of the efficacy and safety of weekly Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel(Nab-P) Followed by Dose-Intensive Epirubicin in Combination with Cyclophosphamide as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

The primary endpoint of the study is to to assess Pathological complete response rate（pCR）using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)..

The total number of patients to be included in this study is 60 patients.

The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be approximately 19 months.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Chemotherapeutic Agent
The primary endpoint is pathological complete remission (pCR), Histopathological examination of breast and axillary lymph node specimens without invasive cancer cell remnants. Complete pathological response is also considered to be achieved if only in situ cancer cell remnants are present in the surgical specimens., 2 months
The second endpoint includes the objective response rate (ORR), The second endpoint ORR composed of tumor response classifications of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), refers to the number of cases with complete and partial response after treatment as a percentage of the total number of evaluable cases., 2 months|Breast conserving surgery(BCS) rate, Percentage of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant therapy as a whole evaluable., 2 months|Adverse events (AE), Adverse events (AE) were monitored on an ongoing basis and classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03. Patients were assessed for toxicities before each administration, and toxicity was graded accordingly., 2 months
