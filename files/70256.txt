Mannitol Brain Relaxation Effect
Mannitol is widely used in patients with elevated intracranial pressure. In neurosurgical field, especially in large size or with brain edema, it is necessary to decrease brain volume to facilitate surgical approach. In general, 0.25 -1.5g of mannitol per kilogram has been known to decrease ICP effectively. But there are some debates in regard to appropriate dose of mannitol.
Supratentorial Neoplasms
DRUG: 0.25g/kgof 20% mannitol|DRUG: 0.5g/kg of 20% mannitol|DRUG: 1.0g/kg of 20% mannitol|DRUG: 1.5g/kg of 20% mannitol
brain parenchymal relaxation, Brain relaxation was assessed immediately after opening of the dura on a scale range from 1 to 4 (1=bulging brain, 2=firm brain, 3-satisfactorily relaxed, 4=perfectly relaxed) by neurosurgeon who is blinded to dose of mannitol.

3 and 4 scale means brain relaxed. We would analyse if the success proportion of brain relaxation increase according to the mannitol increment 0.25g/kg, 0.5g/kg, 1.0g/kg and 1.5g/kg using Cochran-Armitage trend test., intraoperative
Hemodynamic change, Check the mean arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP) at baseline, 30min, 60min, and 180 min after skin incision. Baseline value means data of just after anesthetic induction., at baseline, 30 min, 60min and 180 min after the administration of the study drug|Electrolyte change, Check the serum laboratory result of electrolyte include potassium, sodium immediately before the infusion of mannitol and 30, 60 and 180 min after the administration of the study drug., at baseline, 30 min, 60min and 180 min after the administration of the study drug|Brain relaxation score, Brain relaxation was assessed immediately after opening of the dura on a scale range from 1 to 4 (1=bulging brain, 2=firm brain, 3-satisfactorily relaxed, 4=perfectly relaxed) by neurosurgeon who is blinded to dose of mannitol., intraoperative|Urine output, check the urine amount at baseline (just after induction of anesthesia), 30min/60min/180min after mannitol loading., at just after induction of anesthesia, 30min, 60min and 180 min after mannitl loading|Osmolar gap change, Check the serum osmolarity, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose immediately before the infusion of mannitol and 30, 60, and 180 minutes after the administration of the study drug for calculate the osmolar gap.

Osmolar gap (OG) = measured osmolarity - calculated osmolarity Calculated osmolarity = 2x\[Na(mMol)\]+1.15x(\[glucose(mg/dL)/18)+(\[urea(mg/dL)/2.8), at baseline, 30min, 60min and 180 min after the administration of the study drug
Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) change, Check the arterial blood gas analysis include (pH, PaCO2, PaO2, lactate and hematocrit) immediately before the infusion of mannitol and 30, 60, and 180 minutes after the administration of the study drug., at baseline, 30min, 60min and 180 min after the administration of the study drug
Previous meta-analysis reported that mannitol has dose-response relationship with intracranial pressure. Another study of Sorani showed dose-response relationship between mannitol and intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury patients.

In this study, authors would investigate that mannitol increments can provide more brain relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor removal.
