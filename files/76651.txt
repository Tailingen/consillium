A Study of Dabrafenib Plus Cetuximab/Panitumumab With FOLFOX in the First Line of Therapy in People With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FOLFOX regimen with dabrafenib and cetuximab/panitumumab in the first line of therapy for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer that: has a metastatic, inoperable; has a mutation in the BRAF gene and MSS.

Participants in this study will receive one of the following study treatments:

These participants will receive FOLFOX regimen with dabrafenib and cetuximab or panitumumab in the first line of therapy This study is currently enrolling participants who will receive either FOLFOX regimen with dabrafenib and cetuximab or panitumumab in the first line of therapy.

The study team will monitor how each participant responds to the study treatment for up to about 3 years.
