PALbociclib Rechallenge in horMone Receptor-posItive/HER2- Negative Advanced Breast Cancer (PALMIRA)
Hormone Receptor (HR)-positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC)
Breast Cancer|Advanced Breast Cancer|Hormone Receptor Positive Tumor|Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Negative Carcinoma of Breast
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Endocrine therapy
PFS (Progression-free survival), From a clinical point of view, the primary endpoint for this study is the PFS (progression-free survival) - defined as the period of time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death - assessed by RECIST criteria v.1.1, of continuation of palbociclib treatment combined with second-line endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus endocrine therapy in pre- and post- menopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-negative ABC., Baseline up to 29 months
Safety AEs, Patient safety and adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated using the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0. Grade 3 and 4 AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed to determine the safety and tolerability of the different treatment arms., Baseline up to 29 months|Efficacy (ORR), To compare the objective response rate (ORR), the duration of response (DoR), the time to response (TTR), the clinical benefit rate (CBR), the time to progression (TTP), and the overall survival (OS) of palbociclib plus second-line endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus endocrine therapy alone, Baseline up to 29 months|Efficacy (Quality of Life), To compare the patient reported global Quality of Life (QOL), functioning and symptoms of palbociclib plus second-line endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus endocrine therapy alone., Baseline up to 42 months|Efficacy of subgroup analysis, To perform subgroup analysis for primary and secondary endpoints in stratified groups of patients., Baseline up to 42 months|Compare efficacy, To compare the time to first chemotherapy of palbociclib plus second-line endocrine therapy (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus endocrine therapy alone., Baseline up to 42 months|Exploratory objectives (molecular markers), To explore potential molecular markers of sensitivity and/or resistance for the combination and endocrine therapy alone, according to, but not limited to, the results obtained from the BioPER trial (NCT03184090)., Baseline up to 42 months|Exploratory objectives (intrinsic molecular subtypes), To explore correlations between the intrinsic molecular subtypes and efficacy/safety findings in patients with HR-positive/HER2- negative ABC., Baseline up to 42 months
Pre- and post-menopausal women age â‰¥ 18 years with HR-positive and HER2-negative with ABC that had previously received first-line endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib and had achieved clinical benefit during palbociclib-based treatment. Patients relapsing on a palbociclib-based regimen in the adjuvant setting are also eligible. Patients are not eligible if they are candidates for a local treatment with a curative intention. Evidence of either measurable and biopsiable metastatic disease (as for Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1)) or non-measurable disease with bone lesion is required. Pre-menopausal women must be under treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues.
