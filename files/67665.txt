A Study of AP505 Injection in Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of AP505 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AP505.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AP505
Dose-Escalation : DLT Assessment, Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), From Day1 to Day15 after first dose of AP505|AE Assessment, All AEs and SAEs will be collected, regardless of the relationship to the IP., From screening to follow-up period which includes safety follow-up (30/60/90 days after last dose) and survival follow-up (every 3 months until subject loss to follow-up, death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination, whichever occurs first).|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), From first dose of AP505 until 28 days after the last dose of AP505|Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), From first dose of AP505 until 28 days after the last dose of AP505
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Analysis, From C1D1 until 7 days after treatment discontinuation/ termination.|To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) Analysis, From first dose until 7 days after treatment discontinuation/ termination.|To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) Analysis, From first dose until 7 days after treatment discontinuation/ termination.|To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Time to reach the maximum observed concentration (Tmax) Analysis, From first dose until 7 days after treatment discontinuation/ termination|To characterize the immunogenicity profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Immunogenicity indicators: the level of anti-drug antibody (ADA)., From C1D1 (Cycle 1 is 15 days ; Cycle 2 onwards: each cycle is 28 days), until safety follow up (up to 90 days after the last dose).|To characterize the immunogenicity profile of AP505 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Immunogenicity indicators: the level of NAb (if ADA is positive)., From C1D1 (Cycle 1 is 15 days ; Cycle 2 onwards: each cycle is 28 days), until safety follow up (up to 90 days after the last dose).
