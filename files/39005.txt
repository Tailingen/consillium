A Dose Escalation/Expansion Study of MDK-703 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study of MDK-703 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies in adult study participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating MDK-703 in adult study participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will initially commence with dose escalation to evaluate the safety/tolerability of MDK-703 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. Once the monotherapy and/or combination therapy maximum tolerated dose (MTD), optimal biological dose (OBD), and/or recommended dose (RD) has been determined, then dose expansion of MDK-703 may commence in select populations of interest. The study will also evaluate the anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of MDK-703 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies.
