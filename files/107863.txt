Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: mitoxantrone hydrochloride|DRUG: vinorelbine tartrate
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of the combination of mitoxantrone and vinorelbine in terms of response rate, progression free survival, overall survival, and quality of life in patients with metastatic hormone refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
* Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1 and 8 and mitoxantrone IV on day 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment, prior to each course, and then at 2 months after study completion.

Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
