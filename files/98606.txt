Evaluation of the Concordance Between Pre-therapy Dosimetry Performed From 68Ga-PSMA-11 Dynamic PET and Post-treatment Dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Vectorized Internal Radiotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Resistant to Hormonal Castration.
Patients undergo three diagnostic PET scans: 18F-FDG PET scan / 18F-Choline PET scan and 68Ga-PSMA PET scan. Following the diagnostic PET scans, and if patients' eligibility for 177Lu-PSMA-617 IVR treatment is confirmed, SPECT acquisitions will be performed during the first treatment course at 5h, 24h, 4 days and 8 days for dosimetric control.

The patient will then return to the nuclear medicine department to undergo SPECT/CT (3 FOV) acquisitions using the same methods as those presented above and recommended in the standard management at : D+24h post-injection, D+4d post-injection and D+8d post-injection No further research-specific acts or procedures will be performed at the end of the first treatment course.

Continuity of treatment will be carried out in accordance with standard management and treatment requirements and modalities, as will clinical, biological and radiological follow-up.
Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: 177Lu-PSMA-617 PET scan
Study the correlation between pre- and post-treatment estimates of absorbed doses to organs at risk, Pre-treatment absorbed dose estimates will be determined during 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET acquisitions. Post-treatment absorbed dose estimates will be determined using 177Lu-PSMA-617 SPECT acquisitions., During 12 months
Internal vectored radiotherapy (IVRT) for mCPRCs is emerging as a new treatment line of choice. Radiolabeled molecules with a high affinity for PSMA have emerged as promising theranostic radiopharmaceuticals for the management of mCPRCs.

The 177Lu-PSMA-617 had substantial anti-tumor effects, including a beneficial effect on survival in cases of mCRPC. With regard to the choice of diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, which must be homologous to the therapeutic agent, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional radiological imaging for detecting lymph node or bone metastases in prostate cancer. The evaluation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 as a new radiopharmaceutical also requires a dosimetry step, which is essential for studying the "injected activity - therapeutic response - adverse effects/toxicity" relationship.

The aim of this study is to carry out a dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET acquisition in order to evaluate pre-therapy absorbed doses and to compare these with post-therapy dosimetry carried out during the first course of 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment using SPECT acquisitions.

This research is part of standard management and will not modify the activities of radiopharmaceuticals administered during diagnostic PET examinations with 18F-FDG, 18F-Choline and 68Ga-PSMA-11 or during treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617.
