Prognostic Evaluation of Changing Endocrine Therapy in Women With Breast Cancer
It suggests in the Guideline that the postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have taken selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) therapy for 2-3 years could benefit from changing endocrine therapy to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). This is a prospective, randomized and non-inferior trial to evaluate the prognosis of changing endocrine therapy from SERMs to AIs in perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
