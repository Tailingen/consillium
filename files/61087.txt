Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Solid Tumors
The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of doxorubicin, 75 mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).

Number of Adverse Events From Escalating Doses of NGR-hTNF in Combination With a Fixed Dose of Doxorubicin, An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or experience in a patient or clinical investigation subject treated administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a casual relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pharmacokinetic Profiles of NGR-hTNF Administrated in Combination With Doxorubicin (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic profiles of NGR-hTNF and doxorubicin was conducted in 4 sequential cohorts of patients (Three patients per each cohort were planned). The first 3 patients of the first cohort were treated with 0.2 μg/m2 of NGR-hTNF in combination with a suboptimal dose (minus 20%) of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2).Following 4 cohorts were treated with escalating dose of NGR-hTNF (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 μg/m2) in combination with a standard dose of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2):, prior to infusion and 15', 30', 60', 90', 120', 134' [1 minute before the end of doxorubicin administration], 180', 240', 360' minutes|Pharmacokinetic Profiles of NGR-hTNF Administrated in Combination With Doxorubicin (Tmax), Pharmacokinetic profiles of NGR-hTNF and doxorubicin was conducted in 4 sequential cohorts of patients (Three patients per each cohort were planned).

Lesions had to have clearly defined borders and initially were measured in at least one dimension, and had to be repeated at each evaluation of the disease by the same method. Sum of the longest diameter (LD) was calculated as the baseline sum LD Complete Response(CR): Disappearance of all TL Partial Response(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of TL, taking as reference the base line sum LD Progressive Disease(PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of TL, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started, after the first 2 cycles(Follow-up 2) of treatment and then every 2 cycles (Follow-up 4,6..). In case of detection of a complete or partial response, a confirmation assessment must be performed ≥ 4 weeks after the first documentation of the response.
This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned.

Patients, with advanced or metastatic solid tumor previously treated with a non cumulative dose of doxorubicin (\<300 mg/sqm in order to allow an adequate number of cycles) or chemotherapy naïve will be enrolled.
