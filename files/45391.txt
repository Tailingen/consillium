Time To Progression (TTP) Investigator Assessment, Interval from the date of registration to the date of disease progression Investigator assessment As per RECIST (v1.0), disease progression represented an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Every 9 (+/- 1 ) weeks during study treatment until documentation of progression or end of study treatment + confirmation PR or CR no less than 4 weeks after initial documentation of response|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Investigator Assessmt % of Patients in the gp Who Achieve a Complete Response-CR,Partial Response-PR or Stable Disease-SD for 16wks From Registrat° Considering the Global Response Combining RECIST Criteria and CA125 Assessmts, RECIST(v1.0):

* CR:disappearance of all target les°\&non-target les°\&normalization of tumor marker level
* PR:at least 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target les°-ref the baseline sum LD OR CR for target les°\&incomplete resp/SD for non target les°
* SD:insufficient shrinkage for PR or increase for PD-ref the smallest sum LD since ttmt started or Persistence of one/more non-target les°or/\&maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal

CA125 level:

* PR:elev of CA125 at baseline PR if a ≥ 50% decrease compared to baseline value observed on 2 consec assessmts drawn at least 1 wk apart
* CR:elev of CA125 at baseline CR 2 CA125 below ULN observed on 2 consec assessmts drawn at least 1 wk apart
* SD:neither CR/PR nor PD

Best overall resp of :

* CR:if CR per RECIST \& per CA125
* PR:if CR per RECIST \& PR per CA125 OR CR per RECIST and SD per CA125 with elev CA125 at baseline OR PR per RECIST \& CR/PR or SD per CA125
* SD:other cases not qualifying for progression-at least 24 wks, At 16 weeks from registration|Overall Survival (OS) Investigator Assessment, Interval between the date of registration and the date of death, Day 1 of each cycle during study treatment + follow-up every 6 months for the first 3 years in the study or until death whichever occurs first|Time To Marker Progression (TTMP) Investigator Assessment - Interval Form the Date of Registration to the Date of Disease Progression as Per GCIG 2005 Definition of CA 125 Progression., The GCIG criteria (November 2005) were used to define progressive disease, based on serum CA 125 levels, as follows:

* Patients with elevated CA 125 pretreatment and normalization of CA 125 needed to show evidence of CA 125 greater than, or equal to, two times the ULN on two occasions at least 1 week apart or
* Patients with elevated CA 125 pretreatment, which never normalizes needed to show evidence of CA 125 greater than, or equal to, two times the nadir value on two occasions at least 1 week apart or
* Patients with CA 125 in the normal range pretreatment needed to show evidence of CA 125 greater than, or equal to, two times the ULN on two occasions at least 1 week apart., Day 1 of each cycle|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Investigator Assessment - Interval From Registration to Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause - According to RECIST and CA 125, A patient may have been declared to have progressive disease on the basis of radiological measuremt of tumor lesions assessmt or CA125 evaluation (tumor measuremts taking precedence).Radiological progression was defined as per the RECIST guidelines (Therasse et al, JNCI2000) as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions(ref the smallest sum of the longest diam recorded since the treatmt started or since the appearance of at least 1 new lesion).Serum CA125 progression was defined, according to the 2005 GCIG def: pts with:

* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt and normalization of CA125 has to show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt which never normalized must show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* CA125 in the normal range pretreatmt had to show evidence of CA125 ≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart, Every 9 (+/- 1 ) weeks during study treatment until documentation of progression or end of study treatment + confirmation PR or CR no less than 4 weeks after initial documentation of response
