Those values are calculated using the non-compartmental model., Pre-set time points: from C1D1 within 1 hour pre-dose to 30 ± 7 days, after EOT up to 1 year|Rac, Rac is the accumulation ratios of SHR-4602, total antibodies, or free toxin. It will be evaluated based on the ratio of exposure following multiple administrations to the single administration, Pre-set time points: from C1D1 within 1 hour pre-dose to 30 ± 7 days, after EOT up to 1 year|anti-SHR-4602 antibody (ADA), Approximately 4 mL of blood samples will be collected at pre-set time points and used for immunogenicity-related studies, which may include designation of in-study cut-points, analysis of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody, and target interference studies. All ADA assay results obtained will be listed. Samples positive for ADA will be analyzed for titers. The percentage of ADA positive subjects, time to ADA onset, ADA duration will be summarized by dose group., Pre-set time points: from C1D1 within 1 hour pre-dose to 30 ± 7 days, after EOT up to 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR refers to the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of Complete/Partial Response (CR or PR) in subjects with measurable diseases by tumor imaging per RECIST v1.1. For subjects with CR or PR at the first evaluation, the efficacy should be confirmed 4 weeks later or at the next tumor imaging evaluation., From the first date with measurable disease meeting the CR or PR criteria, to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. assessed for a maximum duration of up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR refers to the time from the first occurrence of CR or PR to Progression of Disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, in subjects with objective response. If the subject does not experience PD or death or is lost to follow-up at the end of study, DOR will be censored at the time of the last tumor evaluation. DOR will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier, From the first date with measurable disease meeting the CR or PR criteria, to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. assessed for a maximum duration of up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR refers to the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD). Subjects evaluated as SD should meet the criteria for SD at least once at a minimum of 6 weeks after enrolment., From the first date with measurable disease meeting the CR, PR or SD criteria, to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. assessed for a maximum duration of up to 3 years.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS refers to the time from the first dose of SHR-4602 to the first PD or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) as assessed by the investigator. If the subject does not experience PD or death or receives other anti-tumor treatments at the end of study, PFS will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment. PFS will also be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., From the first dose of SHR-4602 to the first PD or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). assessed for a maximum duration of up to 3 years
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR-4602 in subjects with HER2-expressing or HER2-mutated locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
