DRUG: tarloxotinib bromide
ORR, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of tarloxotinib according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for tumors assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in the short axis measurement of all pathologic lymph nodes to ≤10 mm. Partial Response (PR) - ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions compared with baseline.

The overall response rate in each cohort will be estimated as the number of subjects with a confirmed objective response (CR or PR) divided by the number of enrolled subjects in each respective cohort., Through study completion, an average of 10 months.
