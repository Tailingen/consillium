DNA Sequencing-Based Monitoring of Minimal Residual Disease to Predict Clinical Relapse in Aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a blood test can accurately detect whether if the participant's lymphoma has come back after completion of initial chemotherapy treatment for their aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of the study is to see if MRD in blood samples can potentially replace CT scans after completion of chemotherapy in the future.
