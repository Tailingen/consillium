Pretherapeutic Paraaortic Lymphadenectomy in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Versus Definitive Chemoradiotherapy
This is an international, prospective, multicenter and randomized phase III study designed to determine if patients with locally advanced cervical cancer have longer overall survivals with pretherapeutic paraaortic surgical staging when compared to radiologic staging.
Overall Survival Comparison Between the 2 Arms
PROCEDURE: Surgery followed with chemoradiation|RADIATION: Standard chemoradiation|RADIATION: chemoradiation
Overall survival, A Positon Emission Tomography (PET) scan will be obtained at 3 months after completion of chemoradiation therapy. CT scans will be obtained every 6 months for the next three years thereafter. Follow-up surveillance of patients will consist of serial clinical examinations by an oncologist every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years; then, patients will be followed annually only for collection of their survival data. Patients will come off study at 5 years after completion of initial chemoradiation therapy or at time of death., up to 10 years
All eligible patients will be equally randomized between the 2 following treatment groups:

* Standard of care arm: standard chemoradiation (whole pelvis chemoradiation therapy).
* Experimental arm: pretherapeutic paraaortic lymphadenectomy followed by tailored chemoradiation. Pretherapeutic lymphadenectomy will be performed via the laparoscopic extraperitoneal or transperitoneal approach using either traditional laparoscopy or robotically-assisted laparoscopy.

The surgery (extraperitoneal or transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy) is considered investigational.

Chemoradiation treatment (with either pelvis or tailored radiation) is considered as standard treatment approved in France for the treatment of cervical cancer.
