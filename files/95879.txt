Assessment of Complications in Patients Who Underwent LPN According to the CCI
This study aims to compare the strength of the classical Clavien-Dindo classification system (CDC), which is a Likert scale analysis versus the comprehensive complication index (CCI), a new quantitative evaluation system, in patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN).
Renal Cancer|Surgery-Complications
Postoperative complication, Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings that may be seen after surgery and require additional intervention, treatment, or follow-up, up to 3 months, postoperatively|Opertaion time, From first trocar incision to closure of all incisions, during the surgery (minute)|Estimeted blood loss, perioperative estimated blood loss, during the surgery (mL)|warm ischemia time, Its starts when the renal artery and vein are controlled and it ends when reperfusion of the graft kidney starts on the back table, during the surgery (minute)
Prospectively collected data of sixty-two patients undergoing LPN with postoperative complications from November 2009 to August 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Postoperative complications were classified according to the CDCs and calculated using the CCI calculator (https://www.assessurgery.com) quantitatively. Major complications were determined as â‰¥ grade 3 complications according to the CDC. The complexity of the renal mass was defined according to the RENAL nephrometry score. The cut-off value for CCI was analyzed by the ROC analysis technique. The significance level was taken as p\<0.05.
