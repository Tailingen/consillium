A Study of Tilvestamab (BGB149) in Relapsed, Platinum-resistant, High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) Participants
The primary purpose is to assess the safety and tolerability of tilvestamab following IV administration of multiple doses to participants with HGSOC who have been treated with at least 1 complete course of platinum-based chemotherapy and whose disease has relapsed with platinum resistance (\[PRR\]-HGSOC) and to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) exposure by comprehensive profiling (at single dose and steady-state) of multiple ascending doses of tilvestamab.
Ovarian Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Tilvestamab
Number of Participants with Adverse events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study or, if present at Screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with laboratory (haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, serum inflammatory cytokine profile, and urinalysis) abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Vital Sign Abnormalities, Number of participants with vital sign (supine blood pressure \[BP\], heart rate, oral temperature, and respiratory rate) abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities, Number of participants with resting triplicate 12-lead ECG abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Physical Examinations Abnormalities, Number of participants with physical examinations abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Concomitant Medication Use, Number of participants with concomitant medication use will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be determined directly from the concentration-time profile., Up to 140 days|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Time to Cmax will be determined directly from the concentration-time profile., Up to 140 days|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Predose (Time 0) to the end of the Dosing Period (AUC0-tau), AUC0-tau will be calculated using the linear-log trapezoidal rule., Up to 140 days|AUC From Predose (Time 0) to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast), AUClast will be calculated using the linear-log trapezoidal rule., Up to 140 days|AUC From Predose (Time 0) to 168 Hours Postdose (AUC0-168 ), AUC0-168 is AUC from predose (time 0) to 168 hours postdose., Predose up to 168 hours postdose|Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (Lambda[z]), Lambda\[z\] will be determined by selection of at least 3 data points on the terminal phase of the concentration-time curve., Up to 140 days|Terminal Elimination Half-life, Terminal elimination half-life calculated as: ln2/Lambda\[z\], Up to 140 days|Total body clearance (CL), CL is defined as total body clearance., Up to 140 days
Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), Number of participants with ADAs will be reported., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Participants with Neutralizing Antibodies (NAbs), Number of participants with NAbs will be reported., Up to 2.5 years
