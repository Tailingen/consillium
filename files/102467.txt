Study of Recurrence-directed Therapy (RDT) With or Without Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) In Patients With Radio-recurrent Oligo-metastatic Hormone/Castrate Sensitive Prostate Cancer (romCSPC)
The goal of this study is to determine whether the addition of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) utilizing the study drug ELIGARD® to Recurrence- Directed Therapy (RDT) improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to RDT alone in patients with early radio-recurrent oligo-metastatic castrate / hormone sensitive prostate cancer (romCSPC). Participants will be assessed at standard of care clinic visits every 3 months. The follow-up period is 36 months.

A multi-centre, open-label, phase II randomized clinical trial evaluating the addition of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) utilizing the study drug ELIGARD® compared to Recurrence Directed Therapy (RDT) alone in patients with previously localized prostate adenocarcinoma treated with definitive radiotherapy or with salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy who experience biochemical recurrence and present with oligo-metastases (i.e., \< 5 sites of metastases) on conventional imaging. Eligible and consenting patents will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either RDT alone (standard arm) or RDT +ADT (ELIGARD®) x12 months (experimental arm). During treatment study participants will be assessed for disease progression, development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) radiotherapy toxicity, the occurrence of adverse events, initiation of tertiary therapy, overall survival and quality of life through the completion of participant questionnaires. Participants will be assessed at standard of care clinic visits every 3 months. The follow-up period is 36 months from the date of randomization. The planned sample size is 162 study participants.
