Dose-escalation Study to Assess Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Nab-Sirolimus in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors and Moderate Liver Impairment
This is a phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of nab-sirolimus in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and moderate hepatic impairment or normal hepatic function.

This is a phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of nab-sirolimus in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and moderate hepatic impairment or normal hepatic function. Eligible patients will receive nab-sirolimus by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes (+10 min) on Days 1 and 8.
