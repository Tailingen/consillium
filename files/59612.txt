The Efficiency for Stage II-III HR+/HER2+ Early Breast Cancer Patient With Standard Neoadjuvant Therapy in Real World.
To observe the efficiency for patient with stage II-III HR+/HER2+ early breast cancer with standard neoadjuvant therapy, a retrospective, multicenter study in real world settings.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Standard Therapy
Total pathological complete response (tpCR), tpCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on resected breast specimen and the sampled regional lymph nodes as shown by hematoxylin-eosin staining after completion of the neoadjuvant treatment., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Best overall response rate (BORR) [ Time Frame: During neoadjuvant treatment, The proportion of patients who respond to the treatment at any study time point, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Residual cancer burden (RCB), RCB score is obtained according to pathological evaluation after completion of neoadjuvant treatment and surgery, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Overall survival (OS), It refers to the length of time from the start of treatment to the death of the patient., Within 5 years after surgery|Disease-free survival (DFS), It refers to the length of time from the start of medication after enrollment to the death of the patient because of the recurrence, distant metastasis of the disease, invasive contralateral breast cancer, or any other cause., Within 5 years after surgery
This study collected patients used standard neoadjuvant therapy (TCbHP/THP/EC-THP/AC-THP) among stage II-III HR+/HER2+ early breast cancer, and to describe patient clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of them in real world settings.
