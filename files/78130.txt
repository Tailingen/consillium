A Clinical Trial of Oral Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) in Patients With Advanced Multiple Myeloma (0683-004)
The purposes of this study are:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAHA administered every 12 hours for 14 consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest during the first two cycles (i.e., first 6 weeks) in patients with advanced multiple myeloma;
* To assess the safety and overall response rate to SAHA in patients with advanced multiple myeloma.
