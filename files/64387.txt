Autologous LN-145 in Patients With Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label, multi-cohort, non-randomized, multicenter phase 2 study evaluating LN-145 in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: LN-145|BIOLOGICAL: LN-145
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate the efficacy of LN-145 as determined by objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic NSCLC using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), as assessed by central review for Cohorts 1 and 2 and by the investigator for Cohorts 3, 4 and the Retreatment Cohort, Up to 60 months

LN-145 is a ready-to-infuse TIL therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI and further optimized by Iovance for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL, then finally followed by the administration of IL-2.
