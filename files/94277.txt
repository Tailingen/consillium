Clinical Study of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Lymphocytes (CAR-T) in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T infusion preparation in the treatment of CD19-positive relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cells
Incidence of Adverse events after CAR-T cells infusion [Safety and Tolerability], Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 28 days|Objective response rate after CAR-T cells infusion [Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes CR,PR, 3 months
AUCS of CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of pCAR-19B cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of pCAR-19B cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of pCAR-19B cells [Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of pCAR-19B cells[Cell dynamics], IL-6 levels measured by Chemiluminescence method, 3 months
Objective response rate (ORR) of CAR-T treatment in patients with Relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma[Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：CR、PR, 2 years|Overall survival(OS)of CAR-T treatment in patients with Relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CAR-T treatment in patients with Relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression, 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of CAR-T treatment in patients with Relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label study. After meeting the eligibility criteria and enrolling on the trial, patients will undergo leukapheresis for collection of autologous lymphocytes. Once cells have been manufactured, patients will then proceed to lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for 1-2 consecutive days followed by the infusion of CAR T-cells at a target dose of 3-10x105 cells/kg.
