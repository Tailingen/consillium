Study to Determine the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of DO-2 in Patients with Advanced or Refractory Solid Tumours
This study is a first-in-human, open-label, 2-part, Phase 1 dose escalation study of DO-2, administered orally to patients with advanced or refractory solid tumours, with MET aberrations, and no available, approved therapeutic alternative.

Number of subjects who experience Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Only toxicities that occur during Cycle 1 will be considered for the purposes of defining DLT and for dose escalation, but toxicities that occur in all cycles will be recorded and considered in decisions about the Maximum Tolerated Dose. DLTs are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria. Toxicity grading will be performed in accordance with NCI-CTC Version 5.0., Baseline up to Week 4|Number of subjects who experience specific treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), Number of subjects with specific treatment-related adverse events for each dose group.

AE refers to any untoward medical occurrence or deterioration of existing medical event after the subject signed the ICF, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. TRAEs are any event that occurs after the subject has received study treatment. AE grading will be performed in accordance with NCI-CTC Version 5.0., Baseline up to Week 36|Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD in milligram is defined as the highest dose at which less than one third of the subjects in a dose level cohort experience DLT., Baseline up to Week 4
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and Area under the curve (AUC) of DO-2, Determine the Cmax and AUC of DO-2 and its main metabolites in plasma sampled at different timepoints during Cycle 1., Baseline up to Day 23|Time over treshold (ToT) for DO-2, Time by which the observed concentration of DO-2 in plasma is above the expected efficacy treshold., Baseline up to Day 23|Objective responses seen in Part I and objective response rate (ORR) in Part II, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR. Radiologic assessment will be repeated after every second cycle (or more frequently if clinically indicated) and using same methodology as at baseline. Response assessment (radiologic) will be determined in accordance with RECIST (version 1.1) and current disease specific solid tumour response criteria., Baseline through study completion, an average of 36 weeks|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST Version 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline through study completion, an average of 36 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (based on RECIST Version 1.1)., Baseline through study completion, an average of 36 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause., Baseline through study completion, an average of 36 weeks
In Part 1, a Simon Design 3 accelerated titration design will be followed. One patient will be enrolled per cohort, until grade 2 toxicity is observed. Three sequential patients per cohort will be enrolled thereafter, with a minimum of 1 week between first dose administration in the first patient and the subsequent ones, in those latter cohorts.
