Efficacy of Venetoclax Combined with Intensive Chemotherapy in Different Subgroups of AML
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common hematological malignancy. Intensive chemotherapy is the main treatment in fit patients.

Retrospective studies have shown that Venetoclax is highly effective in elder AML patients with IDH2 and NPM1 mutations while in those with TP53 and FLT3 mutations, the combination of azacitidine with Venetoclax showed an increased remission rate without improved survival.

Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease, it is not clear which genetic type of adult AML patients would benefit from Venetoclax combined with intensive chemotherapy.

Therefore, this study intends to conduct a phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of intensive chemotherapy combined with Venetoclax in adult AML patients, and reveal the efficacy of Venetoclax added to chemotherapy regimens for AML with different cytogenetic and molecular subgroups.
AML (Acute Myelogenous Leukemia)
DRUG: combined chemotherapy
Event-free survival (EFS), All patients definitions for the trial; From the date of enrollment to the time of treatment failure after two courses of induction therapy, recurrence after CRc, date of all-cause death, or the date of last survival follow-up., up to 2 years after the date of the last enrolled participants
Complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) with negative MRD detected by flow cytometry, The ratio of CR/CRh/CRi with negative MRD detected by flow cytometry after induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy., up to 1 years after the date of the last enrolled participants|CR/CRh/CRi with negative MRD detected by PCR, The ratio of CR/CRh/CRi with negative MRD detected by PCR after induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy., up to 1 years after the date of the last enrolled participants|overall survival (OS), Used to evaluate all patients who enter clinical trials. From the date of entry into the trial until the date of patient death (including any cause) or last survival follow-up., up to 2 years after the date of the last enrolled participants|30-day mortality, Percentage of patients who died within 30 days from enrollment., within 30 days of the date of the last enrolled participants|60-day mortality, Percentage of patients who died within 60 days from enrollment., within 60 days of the date of the last enrolled participants|Complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate, The ratio of patients achieved CR/CRh/CRi after two courses of induction therapy., up to 3 months after the date of the last enrolled participants|Relapse-free survival (RFS), Defined only for patients achieving CRc; measured from the date of achievement of remission until the date of hematologic relapse or death from any cause; patients not known to have relapsed or died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive, up to 2 years after the date of the last enrolled participants
Patients will receive 1 course of intensive chemotherapy combined with venetoclax for induction and those who achieved complete remission will receive 3 courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine combined with Venetoclax for consolidation. After consolidation therapy, Venetoclax in combination with azacitidine will be applied for 6 courses as maintenance treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended for high-risk groups and intermediate-risk with positive measurable residual disease.
