Mitochondria-targeted System Therapy Combined With Radiofrequency Ablation for Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality. Among them, non small cell lung cancer accounts for 85%. Only part of patients could be treated with radical surgery. Mitochondria-targeted system therapy combined with radiofrequency ablation could be an alternative treatment. Small sample clinical cases verified that this therapy could be an efficacy and safe treatment in a short period. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if the efficacy of mitochondria-targeted system therapy combined with radiofrequency ablation is comparable to that of standard surgical interventions for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
