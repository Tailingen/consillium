To explore the treatment efficacy of Progesterone Therapeutic Regimen Plus Azelnidipine in patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and early endometrial carcinoma (EEC) for conservative treatment.
Endometrial Cancer|Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia
DRUG: Amlodipine
Pathological cumulative complete response rate, No endometrioid carcinoma or any proliferative lesion is found by pathology; imaging examination shows no evidence of a tumor, Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Time to Complete remission, Time to CR was calculated from the commencement of fertility-preserving treatment to the date of the initial hysteroscopic examination to confirm CR, Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Recurrence rate, After complete remission, there is evidence of recurrence in pathology, and the imaging examination shows that the lesion recurrences., Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pregnancy rate, A pregnancy test shows pregnancy after CR., Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Live birth rate, The live birth rate is defined as the ratio of live births to pregnancies, Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Observe the pregnancy and delivery rates within 3 years of complete remission of patients|Pathological biomarker, pathological markers(such as Ki-67, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53, PTEN, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) at each hysteroscopy, Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, undergo hysteroscopy to obtain endometrium for HE and IHC of ER/PR; Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adverse reactions, Any unfavorable response resulting from the administration of any pharmaceutical agent utilized as part of the therapeutic regimen., Day 1:take medication orally every day；Every three months, serological testing confirms the effects of drugs on the liver and kidneys; Through study completion, an average of 1 year
After diagnosed of AEH or EEC by hysteroscopy, patients meet the study criteria will be enrolled. The age, height, weight, waistline, blood pressure, drug load, basic history of infertility and family cancer will be collected. Blood tests, including calcium, albumin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), blood lipids, sex hormone levels, anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and renal/liver function tests will be performed before treatment to evacuate their basic conditions.

Patients with endometrial cancer who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into the control group and the experimental group in a 1:1 ratio according to the random numbers generated in advance. The administration regimen for the two groups was as follows:

Control group: progesterone regimen (oral medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet 250mg-500mg/ day or Mirena +GnRHa 3.75mg subcutaneous injection monthly); Trial group: progesterone regimen (oral medroxyprogesterone acetate tablet 250mg-500mg/ day or Mirena +GnRHa3.75mg subcutaneous injection monthly) combined with Azelnidipine (oral Azelnidipine 8mg/ day); The specific selection of progesterone regimen was based on whether the patients had oral progesterone contraindications and if BMI≥28kg/m2 was not suitable for oral progesterone, Mirena +GnRHa regimen was selected. The choice of Azelnidipine is based on the results that Azelnidipine can inhibite growth in several endometrial cancer cells, PDX model and patient-derived cells.

For patients remained SD after 9 months of treatment but refused hysterectomy, a multiple disciplinary discussion would be held for individual case, and alternative treatment would be given. Maintenance treatment will be recommended for patients with CR, and participants will be followed up for at least 1 year.
