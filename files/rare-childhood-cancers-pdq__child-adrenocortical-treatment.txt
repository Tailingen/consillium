Incidence
Go to Patient Version
Adrenocortical tumors encompass a spectrum of diseases with an often-seamless transition from benign (adenoma) to malignant (carcinoma) characteristics.
The incidence of adrenocortical tumors in children is extremely low (only 0.2% of pediatric cancers).[
1
] In children, 25 new cases generally occur annually in the United States, for an estimated annual incidence of 0.2 to 0.3 cases per 1 million individuals.[
2
,
3
] Internationally, however, the incidence of adrenocortical tumors appears to vary substantially. In southern Brazil, it is approximately 10 to 15 times higher than that observed in the United States.[
4
-
6
]
Incidence rates of adrenocortical tumors appear to follow a bimodal distribution, with peaks during the first and fourth decades.[
7
]  Childhood adrenocortical tumors typically present during the first 5 years of life (median age, 3–4 years), although there is a second, smaller peak during adolescence.[

,
8

Female sex is consistently predominant in most studies, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.6:1.0.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Risk Factors
Predisposing genetic factors have been implicated in more than 50% of adrenocortical carcinoma cases in North America and Europe and in 95% of cases in Brazil.[
1
] Germline
TP53
pathogenic variants are almost always the predisposing factor for adrenocortical tumors. The likelihood of a
TP53
germline pathogenic variant is highest in the first years of life and diminishes with age.
In the non-Brazilian cases, relatives of children with adrenocortical tumors often, although not invariably, have a high incidence of nonadrenal cancers (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Germline pathogenic variants usually occur within the region coding for the
TP53
DNA-binding domain (exons 5 to 8, primarily at highly conserved amino acid residues).[
1
,
2
]
In the Brazilian cases, the patients’ families exhibit a lower incidence of cancer than in the classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a single, unique variant at codon 337 in exon 10 of the
TP53
gene is consistently observed.[
3
,
4
] In a Brazilian study, neonatal screening for the
TP53
R337H variant, which is prevalent in the region, identified 461 (0.27%) carriers among 171,649 newborns who were screened.[
5
]  Carriers and relatives younger than 15 years were offered clinical screening.  Adrenocortical tumors identified in the screening participants were smaller and more curable than the tumors found in carriers who did not elect to participate in screening.
Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann and hemihypertrophy syndromes have a predisposition to cancer, and as many as 16% of their neoplasms are adrenocortical tumors.[
6
] Hypomethylation of the
KCNQ1OT1
gene has also been associated with the development of adrenocortical tumors in patients without the phenotypic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.[
7
] However, less than 1% of children with adrenocortical tumors have these syndromes.[
8
]
The distinctive genetic features of pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma have been reviewed.[

Clinical Presentation
Pediatric adrenocortical tumors are almost universally functional. As a result, they cause endocrine disturbances, and a diagnosis is usually made 5 to 8 months after the first signs and symptoms emerge.[
1
,
2
]
Virilization.
Virilization (pubic hair, accelerated growth, enlarged penis, clitoromegaly, hirsutism, and acne) caused by an excess of androgen secretion is seen, alone or in combination with hypercortisolism, in more than 80% of patients.[
3
,
4
]
Hyperestrogenism.
Hyperestrogenism can also occur.[
5
]
Cushing syndrome.
Isolated Cushing syndrome is very rare (5% of patients), and it appears to occur more frequently in older children.[
1
-

,

,
7
]
Because of the hormone hypersecretion, it is possible to establish an endocrine profile for each particular tumor. This profile may help evaluate response to treatment and monitor for tumor recurrence.[

]
Nonfunctional tumors are rare (<10%) and tend to occur in older children.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Histology
Unlike adult adrenocortical tumors, histological differentiation of pediatric adenomas and malignant carcinomas is difficult.[
1
,
2
]  In fact, adenomas and carcinomas appear to share multiple genetic aberrations and may represent points on a continuum of cellular transformation.[
3
]
It appears that approximately 10% to 20% of pediatric cases are adenomas.[
1
,
2
] Macroscopically, adenomas tend to be well defined and spherical, and they never invade surrounding structures. They are typically small (usually <200 cm
3
), and some studies have included size as a criterion for adenomas. By contrast, carcinomas have macroscopic features suggestive of malignancy. They are larger and show marked lobulation with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Microscopically, carcinomas comprise larger cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in alveolar clusters. Several authors have proposed histological criteria that may help distinguish the two types of neoplasms.[
4
-
6
]
Morphological criteria may not allow reliable distinction of benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors. Mitotic rate is consistently reported as the most important determinant of aggressive behavior.[
7
]
IGF2
expression also appears to discriminate between carcinomas and adenomas in adults but not in children.[
8
,
9
] Other histopathological variables are also important. Risk groups may be identified based on a score derived from tumor characteristics such as tumor necrosis; mitotic rate; the presence of atypical mitoses; and venous, capsular, or adjacent organ invasion.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Genomic Alterations
A study performed on 71 pediatric adrenocortical tumors (37 in a discovery cohort and 34 in an independent cohort) provided a description of the genomic landscape of this disease.[
1
]
IGF2
overexpression.
The most common genomic alteration, present in approximately 90% of cases, was copy number loss of heterozygosity for 11p15 with retention of the paternal allele, resulting in
IGF2
overexpression.
TP53
variants.
TP53
variants were commonly observed. Twelve of 71 cases had the Brazilian founder R337H
TP53
germline pathogenic variant. Excluding the Brazilian founder variant cases,
TP53
germline pathogenic variants were observed in approximately one-third of cases and somatic
TP53
variants were observed in approximately 10% of the remaining cases. Approximately 40% of non-Brazilian cases had
TP53
variants. Among cases with
TP53
variants, chromosome 17 loss of heterozygosity with selection against wild-type
TP53
was present in virtually all cases.
ATRX
variants.
ATRX
genomic alterations (primarily structural variants) were present in approximately 20% of cases. All
ATRX
alterations occurred in the presence of
TP53
alterations. The co-occurrence of
TP53
and
ATRX
variants correlated with advanced stage, large tumor size, increased telomere length, and poor prognosis.
CTNNB1
variants.
Activating
CTNNB1
variants were found in approximately 20% of cases and were mutually exclusive with
TP53
germline alterations.
Paternal 11p15 uniparental disomy (UPD).
A retrospective analysis of patients with adrenocortical tumors  at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital identified six children with wild-type
TP53
and germline paternal 11p15 UPD.[
2
] The median age of the five girls and one boy was 3.2 years (range, 0.5–11 years).  Two patients met the criteria for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome before diagnosis of their adrenocortical tumors. However, adrenocortical tumor was the first and only manifestation of paternal 11p15 UPD in four of the children.    Despite poor prognostic features at presentation, such as pulmonary metastasis, bilateral adrenal involvement, and large tumors, all patients were alive 8 to 21 years after their cancer diagnosis.

Prognostic Factors
The overall probability of 5-year survival for children with adrenocortical tumors depends on stage. Survival rates range from greater than 80% for patients with resectable disease to less than 20% for patients with metastases.[
1
-
7
]
Overall, adverse prognostic factors for adrenocortical carcinoma include the following:
Presence of somatic
TP53
variants.
[
8
]
Larger tumor size.
Tumor weights heavier than 200 g and tumor volumes greater than 200 mL have been associated with worse outcomes.[
5
,
6
] Patients with small tumors have an excellent outcome when treated with surgery alone, regardless of histological features.[
9
-
11
]
Disease Stage.
Stage I disease is associated with a better prognosis,[
11
] and metastatic disease is associated with worse outcomes.[
5
-

,
10
,
11
]
Age.
Age older than 4 or 5 years.[

,

,

,

]
Microscopic tumor necrosis.
[
11
]
Para-aortic lymph node involvement.
[
11
]
Incomplete resection or spillage during surgery.
[
5
,
6
,
10
]
Low HLA class II antigen expression.
A low expression of the HLA class II antigens HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, and HLA-DPB1 has been associated with older age, larger tumor size, presence of metastatic disease, and worse outcome.[
12
] In pediatric patients, increased expression of MHC class II genes, especially
HLA-DPA1
,  is associated with a better prognosis.[
13
]
Higher Ki-67 labeling index.
A retrospective analysis of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma reported that higher Ki-67 labeling index correlated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival.[
14
]
Grade, Resection status, Age, and Symptom (GRAS) score.
The GRAS score is a validated predictor of outcome for adrenocortical carcinoma. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (ENSAT) modified the GRAS score to include staging (S-GRAS). They reported that the S-GRAS score was superior to individual components for prediction of outcome in 268 children with adrenocortical carcinoma. The S-GRAS score generated four groups, from 1 (lowest score) to 4 (highest score). The 5-year OS rates by group were 98% for group 1, 87% for group 2, 43% for group 3, and 18% for group 4. In univariable analysis, higher tumor stage, higher grade (i.e., higher Ki67 index), incomplete resection, older age, and presence of hormone-related symptoms were associated with an inferior prognosis.[
15
]
A portion of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma do not have a germline
TP53
pathogenic variant. A retrospective review of children with adrenocortical carcinoma identified 60 patients without germline
TP53
pathogenic  variants.[
8
]  There was a strong female predominance (female-to-male ratio, 42:18) in this group of patients.  The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 71.4%, and the OS rate was 80.5%.  Prognostic factors for this group were the same as the factors identified in previous analyses that did not segregate for
TP53
germline pathogenic variant status.  Unfavorable prognostic features included older age, higher disease stage, heavier tumor weight, presence of somatic
TP53
variants, and higher Ki-67 labeling index. Ki-67 labeling index and age remained significantly associated with PFS after adjusting for stage and tumor weight.

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Adrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment

Treatment of Childhood Adrenocortical Carcinoma
In This Section
Surgery
Chemotherapy
At the time of diagnosis, two-thirds of pediatric patients have limited disease (tumors that can be completely resected), and the remaining patients have either unresectable or metastatic disease.[
1
]
The European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors within the PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network - European Registry) has published consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood adrenocortical tumors.[
2
] Treatment of childhood adrenocortical tumors has evolved using the data from adult studies, and the same guidelines are used. Surgery is the most important mode of therapy, and mitotane and cisplatin-based regimens, usually incorporating doxorubicin and etoposide, are recommended for patients with advanced disease.[

Level of evidence C1

Treatment options for childhood adrenocortical tumors include the following:
Surgery
with or without adjuvant
chemotherapy
.
Surgery
An aggressive surgical approach toward the primary tumor and all metastatic sites is recommended when feasible.[
8
,
9
] Because of tumor friability, rupture of the capsule with resultant tumor spillage is frequent (approximately 20% of initial resections and 43% of resections after recurrence).[
1
] When the diagnosis of adrenocortical tumor is suspected, laparotomy and a curative procedure are recommended rather than fine-needle aspiration to avoid the risk of tumor rupture.[
9
,
10
] Laparoscopic resection is associated with a high risk of rupture and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Therefore, open adrenalectomy remains the standard of care.[
11
]
Evidence (surgery):
The Children's Oncology Group conducted a prospective, single-arm, risk-stratified, interventional study between 2006 and 2013 (
ARAR0332 [NCT00304070]
).[
12
][
Level of evidence B4
]  Patients with stage I disease had small tumors limited to the adrenal gland and were treated with adrenalectomy alone.  Patients with stage II disease had tumors larger than 200 mL or heavier than 100 g  and were treated with adrenalectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Patients with stage III disease had incompletely resected primary tumors. Patients with stage IV disease had distant metastatic disease.  Patients with stage III and stage IV disease were treated with surgery of the primary tumor, RPLND, cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitotane.
The 5-year event-free survival rate estimates were 86.2% for patients with stage I disease (n = 24), 53.3% for patients with stage II disease (n = 15), 81% for patients with stage III disease (n = 24), and 7.1% for patients with stage IV disease (n = 14).
On multivariable analysis, only stage and age were significantly associated with outcome.
The authors reported that the combination of mitotane and chemotherapy resulted in significant toxicity. One-third of patients with advanced disease could not complete the scheduled treatment.
The stated goal of the study was to determine if RPLND would improve outcomes for patients with stage II disease. The operative notes to assess the adequacy of the RPLND were available for 11 of 15 patients. The median number of lymph nodes resected was 4 (range, 1–30). In a multivariable analysis performed in a cohort of 283 adult patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, patients who underwent RPLND (defined as >5 nodes resected) had a significantly reduced recurrence risk and disease-related death rate than patients who did not undergo nodal dissection.[
13
]   The authors  speculate that the RPLNDs performed in this study may not have been as thorough as the procedures carried out in the adult series, which could confound conclusions about the potential value of RPLND.
Chemotherapy
Little information is available about the use of mitotane in children, although response rates appear to be similar to those seen in adults.[
4
,
14
] In adults, mitotane is commonly used as a single agent in the adjuvant setting after complete resection.[
4
]
Evidence (surgery and chemotherapy):
One review included 11 children with advanced adrenocortical tumors who were treated with a mitotane and cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimen.[
4
]
Measurable responses were seen in seven patients.
The mitotane daily dose required for therapeutic levels was approximately 4 g/m
2
, and therapeutic levels were achieved after 4 to 6 months of therapy.
In the GPOH-MET 97 trial, mitotane levels greater than 14 mg/L correlated with better survival in children.[
6
,
7
]
A retrospective analysis identified 177 Italian and German adult patients with completely resected adrenocortical carcinoma.[
15
]
Recurrence-free survival was significantly prolonged by the use of adjuvant mitotane.
The benefit was present with 1 to 3 g per day of mitotane, and this dose was associated with fewer toxic side effects than doses of 3 to 5 g per day.

Adrenocortical tumors are generally considered to be radioresistant. The use of radiation therapy in pediatric patients with adrenocortical tumors has not been consistently investigated. Furthermore, because many children with adrenocortical tumors carry germline
TP53
pathogenic variants that predispose them to cancer, radiation may increase the incidence of secondary tumors. One study reported that  three of five long-term survivors of pediatric adrenocortical tumors died of secondary sarcomas that arose within the radiation field.[

Treatment of Relapsed Childhood Adrenocortical Carcinoma
Treatment options for relapsed childhood adrenocortical tumors include the following:
Checkpoint inhibitors.
In a phase I/II trial of pediatric patients with advanced or relapsed solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab, two of four patients with adrenocortical carcinomas achieved partial responses.[
1
]
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
A single-arm phase II trial included patients aged 18 years and older who had adrenocortical carcinoma and were not candidates for surgery with curative intent. The administration of cabozantinib was associated with stable disease in 12 of 16 patients, for a median duration of 3.7 months, and confirmed partial responses in 2 patients.[

Latest Updates to This Summary (04/03/2025)
The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above.
Prognostic Factors
Added
Grade, Resection status, Age, and Symptom (GRAS) score
as an adverse prognostic factor for adrenocortical carcinoma. Also added text to state that the GRAS score is a validated predictor of outcome for adrenocortical carcinoma. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours modified the GRAS score to include staging (S-GRAS). They reported that the S-GRAS score was superior to individual components for prediction of outcome in 268 children with adrenocortical carcinoma. The S-GRAS score generated four groups, from 1 to 4. The 5-year overall survival rates by group were 98% for group 1, 87% for group 2, 43% for group 3, and 18% for group 4. In univariable analysis, higher tumor stage, higher grade, incomplete resection, older age, and presence of hormone-related symptoms were associated with an inferior prognosis (cited Riedmeier et al. as reference 15).
