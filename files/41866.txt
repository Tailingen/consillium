This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in subjects with advanced gastric carcinoma. At least 30 subjects will be recruited in this study. The subjects will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV), every 21 days (q3w, 1 cycle). All patients will receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 8 cycles).
