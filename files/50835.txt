TACE Combined With Lenvatinib and MWA in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To explore the objective effectiveness and safety of TACE combined with Lenvatinib in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. After successful down-stage, radical microwave ablation was further performed.
Liver Tumor
DRUG: TACE combined with Lenvatinib
Down stage rate, if the patient achieve any of these three criteria： ① the patient was downgraded from BCLC stage C to BCLC stage B (portal branch tumor thrombus was inactive, the focus was less than or equal to 7cm; or the focus did not invade the surrounding tissue after shrinking) or Milan standard (single tumor diameter was not more than 5cm or less than or equal to 3 tumors, and the maximum diameter was not more than 3cm, without vascular invasion). ② Liver function reaches child Pugh grade A or B; ③ The patient is in good health and can tolerate ablation., 4 months
RFS, Recurrence free survival indicates the length of time after MWA for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of HCC, 3 years|Objective response rate, Change of the tumor size according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) \[see attached table 3\], the efficacy is defined as CR (complete remission), PR (partial remission), SD (stable) and PD (Progress), 3 years|Changes of liver and kidney function, Changes of liver and kidney function index from blood biochemistry compared to baseline, 3 years|TACE frequency and ablation frequency, To access the times and frequency of TACE and ablation, 3 years
The purpose of this study is to explore the objective effective rate of TACE combined with Lenvatinib in the treatment of locally advanced liver cancer, so as to provide a new idea for the radical microwave ablation treatment mode after the decline of locally advanced liver cancer.
