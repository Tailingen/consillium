Clinical Research on the Application of Single-channel Uterine Fibroid Morcellation System in Laparoscopic Myomectomy
Research Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore whether the application of a single-channel uterine fibroid morcellation system compared to a multi-channel specimen retrieval bag during laparoscopic myomectomy can shorten the operative time and improve the efficiency of fibroid removal.

Research Design This study is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, 1:1 controlled trial.

Intervention Measures Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into two groups.

Experimental group: Conventional laparoscopic myomectomy with the use of a single-channel uterine fibroid morcellation system for fragmentation and retrieval of the fibroids.

Control group: Conventional laparoscopic myomectomy with the use of a multi-channel specimen retrieval bag and a conventional laparoscopic uterine fibroid morcellator for fragmentation and retrieval of the fibroids.

Observation Indicators Primary observation indicator: Time required for fibroid fragmentation and retrieval (from the placement of the single-channel uterine fibroid morcellation system or the multi-channel specimen retrieval bag to complete removal from the abdominal cavity).

Secondary observation indicators: Success rate of placement, intraoperative damage and leakage rate, gynecological surgeon satisfaction with the surgery, total weight of retrieved uterine fibroid fragments.
