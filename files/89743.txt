A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Robotic Telesurgery Versus Laparoscopic Surgery
This is a randomized controlled trial that will be preceded by a safety trial focusing on the safety and efficacy of robotic telesurgery. The hypothesis is that robotic telesurgery has a non-inferior primary endpoint event rate to local laparoscopic surgery.
Liver Cancer|Renal Cancer|Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robotic telesurgery|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic surgery
Surgical complication, Overall complication events within 30 days of surgery or intraoperative emergency intermediate open surgery events as defined by the Clavin-Dindo grading system, One month after surgery
Surgical time (min), Total time from the start of surgery after robotic or laparoscopic installation to the end of incision closure and the surgeon's operating time., One month after surgery|Intraoperative blood loss (mL), Total bleeding from the start of surgery to the end of incision suturing., One month after surgery|Postoperative hospitalization days, Number of days from the day of surgery to the day of discharge., One month after surgery|Physician satisfaction, A NASA-TLX quantification form was completed by the physician postoperatively., One month after surgery|Remote metrics, Record data related to network transmission end-to-end latency time, jitter, and frame loss., One month after surgery
First, a safety run-in trial for robotic telesurgery will be conducted and evaluated according to "3+3 design". At least 3 patients of each cancer type (including liver cancer,renal cancer and rectal cancer) will be enrolled for robotic telesurgery. If there is a tumor type for which the prior safety trial is terminated, the subsequent randomized controlled trial will not include patients of that type.

Second, after passing the safety run-in trial, a randomized controlled trial will be performed. New patients with each cancer type who met the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to either the laparoscopic surgery group(control group) or the robotic telesurgery group (intervention group) (84 patients in each group, 168 patients in total) in a 1:1 two-group parallel design.
