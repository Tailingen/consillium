Phase III Radium 223 mCRPC-PEACE III
The primary objective of the trial is to assess if upfront combination of enzalutamide and Ra223 improves radiological progression-free survival (rPFS1) compared to enzalutamide single agent in CRPC patients metastatic to bone
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Ra223|DRUG: Enzalutamide
radiological progression-free survival, Radiological progression free survival (rPFS1) is defined according to the recommendations of the "Prostate-Cancer clinical trials Working Group" version 3 and referred to as the "PCWG3"; for the setting "delay/prevent" progression.

An event of progression according to their definition is either of:

* Objective progression of the disease according to RECIST criteria for soft tissue lesions with the additional requirement that progression at the first follow-up assessment be confirmed by a second scan ≥ 6 weeks apart
* Appearance of ≥ 2 new bone lesions and for the first follow-up assessment only (i.e. within 12 weeks, during the flare period), a confirmatory scan performed ≥ 6 weeks later that shows a minimum of two or more additional new lesions (2+2 criterion)

In this protocol:

• PSA progression is not considered disease progression and should NOT trigger a change of treatment., 46 months after first patient entry
Overall survival, number of participants, 63 months after first patient entry|prostate cancer specific survival, number of participants, 63 months after first patient entry|First symptomatic skeletal event, number of participants, 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Time and incidence of first skeletal progression-free survival, number of participants, 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Time from entry to initiation of next systemic anti-neoplastic therapy, number of participants, 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Treatments elected after first disease progression, number of participants, 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Second progression-free survival in sequential regimen, number of participants, 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Patient self-rate scale assessing the pain associated to prostate cancer, Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire: BPI questionnaire is a validated instrument that is a patient self-rated scale assessing level of pain, effect of the pain on activities of daily living, and analgesic use. The BPI also measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. The short form of the BPI is used in this study. It is intended to capture two dimensions of pain: severity and interference. This short version of the BPI contains four pain severity items and seven pain interference items rated on 0-10 scales and uses a 24-hour recall period., 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|Time to pain progression, defined as an increase of 2 or more points in the "worst pain in 24 hours" score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥ 4 weeks apart OR initiation of short or long-acting opioid use for pain, 63 months after first patient entry|Occurence of adverse events, Adverse events will be graded according to the "Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events" CTCAE, version 4.0, 63 months after first patient entry|Time to opiate use for cancer-related pain, number of participants, 63 months after first patient entry|Patient self-rate scale assessing the Quality of Life, EQ5D-5L questionnaire asks respondents to simply 'mark an X on the scale to indicate how your health is TODAY' and then to 'write the number you marked on the scale in the box below'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.

The respondent is asked to indicate his health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. It should be noted that the numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score., 46 and 63 months after first patient entry|rate of skeletal fractures, The rate of skeletal fractures per patient/year of follow-up will be estimated in each treatment arm using recurrent-event analysis methods. Analyses by type of fracture (e.g. pathological fracture) will also be conducted as appropriate., 63 months after first patient entry
