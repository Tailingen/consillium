Study of Motexafin Gadolinium (MGd) in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
The primary purpose of this study is to determine if motexafin gadolinium may be an effective treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Secondly, the duration of response and the time during which patients survive without chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma worsening will be evaluated. Additionally, the patient's response to motexafin gadolinium will be compared to the response of the patient's cells in a laboratory to motexafin gadolinium.
