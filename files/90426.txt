The Tolerance,Pharmacokinetic Characteristics,Safety and Efficacy of ScTIL210 in the Treatment of Melanoma
This is an open-lable, single-arm, single-dose escalation and multiple-dose expansion clinical study of cell therapy to observe and evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety and efficacy of ScTIL210（Super circulating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes）in the treatment of Melanoma.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Super circulating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(ScTIL)
Objective Response Rate(ORR), Including cases of CR and PR, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion
Disease Control Rate(DCR), The number of cases with remission and stable lesions after treatment accounted for the total number of evaluable cases, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion|Duration of Response(DOR), Time from complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to disease progression (PD), death or last tumor evaluation, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion|Progression-Free Survival(PFS), From the beginning of cell therapy to the time of the first disease progression or death due to any cause, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion|Overall survival(OS), Time from cell reinfusion to death due to any cause, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion|Adverse events(AEs), According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V5.0(CTCAE V5.0), 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion|Detection of Lentivirus Copy Number, Dynamic changes of carrier gene copy number in peripheral blood, 24 weeks after the last cell transfusion
