MRI in Pre-operative Radiotherapy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma: MISTS Study
This study will use diffusion weighted MRI (DWI MRI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) techniques to detect changes in sarcoma tumour vasculature. The main aims of this study are to correlate histological response of soft tissue sarcoma after pre-operative radiotherapy with several pre-treatment DCE and DWI MRI parameters and to assess the impact of these on early response prediction. Detected changes may reflect the sensitivity of the tumour to radiotherapy and may be associated with long term outcomes after treatment.

15 patients normally having pre-operative radiotherapy as part of their sarcoma treatment will be recruited to this study.

Patients will have an additional three specialised MRI scans: one prior to the start of radiotherapy, one during the second week of radiotherapy while on treatment and one scan a week before surgery but after the completion of radiotherapy.

Post-operatively, results of the histological examination of the sarcoma will be correlated to both the MRI scan data and outcomes after treatment
Sarcoma
DEVICE: MRI scanning
Correlate histological response of soft tissue sarcoma after pre-operative radiotherapy with pre-treatment DWI and DCE-MRI parameters., The hypothesis is that quantitative biomarkers from DWI and DCE MRI can not only be produced with high spatial resolution in soft tissue sarcoma, but that these imaging biomarkers will correlate with histological and histochemical features of the tumour and will provide information to support the prediction of regional response to radiotherapy., average of 9 weeks including radiotherapy up to one week before surgery
early response prediction of treatment using functional parameters of in-treatment imaging with DWI and DCE-MRI (e.g. relative change in apparent diffusion coefficient values), following surgery at week 7|accuracy of outlining treatment volumes using STIR. T1W, T2W and DWI MRI compared to standard planning CT and loco-regional control patterns, 3 month follow up visit|local recurrence patterns with pre-treatment functional MRI., Within our study, these patients would have an additional three specialised MRI scans: one prior to the start of radiotherapy, one during the second week of radiotherapy while on treatment and one scan the week before the operation after the completion of radiotherapy, 3 timepoints for scans over 6 weeks of treatment
