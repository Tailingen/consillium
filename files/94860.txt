Single Arm Clinical Trial (Gut Microbiota and HCC)
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral enterobacterial capsules in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC who have progressed after treating with immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with anti-angiogenesis targeted agents.
Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Oral enterobacterium capsules
Objective Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To analyse the Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Objective Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS), To analyse the Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Objective Objective Response Rate (ORR), To exprole the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|ObjectiveDuration of Response (DOR), To analyse the Duration of Response (DOR) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Diversity analysis, We will use 16S rRNA sequencing to measure fecal sample. The alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota will be analyzed, including a series of statistical analysis indexes such as Chao, Shannon, Simpsonace, Simpson and Coverage, in order to reflect the microbial community diversity., Up to approximately 1 years|Species differential analysis, We will use 16S rRNA sequencing to measure fecal sample. Based on the results of species annotation, the PCA„ÄÅPCoA and NMDS analysis will be used to assess the similarities and differences in species composition., Up to approximately 1 years|Feces Metabolomics, Changes of metabolites in feces measured by metabolomic mass spectrometry, unsupervised PCA (principal component analysis) was performed by statistics function prcomp, identified metabolites were annotated using KEGG Compound database., Up to approximately 1 years|Serum Metabolomics, Changes of metabolites in serum measured by metabolomic mass spectrometry, unsupervised PCA (principal component analysis) was performed by statistics function prcomp, identified metabolites were annotated using KEGG Compound database., Up to approximately 1 years
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study. For those who meet the enrollment conditions, the original regimen of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti-angiogenic targeted drugs will remain unchanged after enrollment.On this basis, the study subjects started oral enterobacterial capsules to see whther enterobacterial capsules could improve the efficacy of patients receiving the above treatment regimens.

Oral administration of intestinal bacteria capsules 6 capsules/day, after observing no adverse reactions, oral administration for 10 consecutive days, 6 capsules/day from the second day to the tenth day, and then discontinued to the next course of treatment.

Total course of treatment: a total of 4 courses of oral intestinal bacteria capsules, each course of oral administration for 10 days, and a course of 21 days; A course of TKI combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment is 21 days until the disease progresses or intolerable toxicity and side effects appear.

Observe the metrics: Primary Clinical Endpoint - Progression-Free Survival (PFS); Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DOR), and Disease Control Rate (DCR). The new RECIST1.1 criteria were used for the efficacy evaluation system, the CTCAE5.0 grading system was used for the evaluation of common adverse reactions during treatment, and other indicators included imaging including conventional biochemical indexes such as CT and ultrasound, as well as quality of life scores.
