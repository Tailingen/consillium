Drug Sensitivity Correlation Between Patient-Derived Organoid Model and Clinical Response in NSCLC Patients
This clinical study aims to evaluate the feasibility to predict clinical response of target therapy or chemotherapy drugs based on the ex vivo drug sensitivity data using patient-derived organoids.
NSCLC
Correlation of ex vivo sensitivity test on patient derived organoid models, The drug sensitivity was tested on patient-derived tumor organoids, which is compared with clinical response of the chemo or target therapy treatment., 12 months
Methods - Open label single arm observatory comparison experiment

1. Enrolled patients (before or after surgery) were treated with chemotherapy or target therapy. The medication regime and treatment cycle were decided based on the clinical guideline and evidence-based medicine. This clinical study will not affect the treatment plan of the patients.
2. The resection tissue or biopsy tissue of NSCLC will be collected, and subject to ex vivo 3-D culture to establish patient-derived tumor organoid models, which will be used for drug sensitivity test.
3. The patient-derived organoid-based drug sensitivity test will be compared with clinical treatment data of chemotherapy or target therapy, followed by correlation analysis.
