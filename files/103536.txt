A Study of Combination Therapies With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and/or Chemotherapy in Participants With Advanced Esophageal Cancer (MK-3475-06A)
This is a phase I/II multicenter, open-label umbrella platform study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational agents with pembrolizumab, plus chemotherapy or lenvatinib, for the treatment of participants with advanced esophageal cancer who have failed 1 prior line of therapy and have not been previously exposed to programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1)/ programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) based treatment.

With protocol amendment 5 (effective: 17-November-2023), enrollment in study arms "Pembrolizumab plus MK-4830 plus Chemotherapy" and "Pembrolizumab plus MK-4830 plus lenvatinib" is discontinued.

Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Safety Lead-in Phase, A DLT is defined as any drug-related adverse event (AE) according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0, observed during the DLT evaluation period that results in a change to a given dose or a delay in initiating the next cycle., Up to approximately 3 weeks|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) During Safety Lead-in Phase, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 3 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE During Safety Lead-in Phase, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 3 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from allocation to the first documented progressive disease (PD) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of allocation to death from any cause., Up to approximately 40 months|Number of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During the Efficacy Phase, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 40 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to An AE During the Efficacy Phase, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 104 weeks
The master protocol is MK-3475-U06.
