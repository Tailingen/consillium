A Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma With TheraSphere®
This is an interdisciplinary study that falls into the Humanitarian Use Device category. There are no hypotheses to be tested in this treatment protocol. The study has the following objectives:

1. Provide supervised access to treatment with TheraSphere® to eligible patients with primary cancer to the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.
2. Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment.
3. Measure tumor response rates

Number of patients given access to treatment with TheraSphere., The number of eligible patients provided with supervised access to treatment with TheraSphere with primary cancer to the liver who are not surgical resection candidates., 24 months|Evaluate patient experience with Therasphere., Evaluation of patient experience and toxicities associated with Therasphere via patient follow-ups with clinician notes., 24 months
Tumor response to treatment with TheraSphere®, Diagnostic imaging studies for assessment of tumor response will be performed according to usual standard of care as established by the referring oncologist., 24 Months
The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at this institution to TheraSphere® treatment for a heterogeneous population of patients with unresectable primary liver tumors, with the liver being the only dominant site of disease. Based on experience gained in previous studies and well-established interventional radiology techniques, this protocol allows multiple treatments with TheraSphere® that may be delivered on an inpatient or out patient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or lobar treatment delivered as a sequence of treatments approximately 30 - 90 days apart. The investigator, working with co-investigators in radiation oncology, interventional radiology and nuclear medicine, will develop a specific treatment plan for each patient, based upon the presenting condition of the patient, the vascular anatomy, and the desired goal of treatment.
