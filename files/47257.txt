Early Detection Initiative for Pancreatic Cancer
The Early Detection Initiative for Pancreatic Cancer is a multi-center prospective study to determine if algorithm-based screening in patients with glycemically defined new onset hyperglycemia and diabetes has the potential for earlier detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

The Early Detection Initiative (EDI), is designed to prospectively evaluate the performance characteristics of the Enriching New-onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC) model to enrich glycemically defined new-onset diabetes for pancreatic cancer. The study will also determine with elevated ENDPAC score occurs at a clinically meaningful lead time (\>/= 4 months) before pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

Eligible patients are identified and enrolled based on a first-time elevation in fasting blood glucose parameters or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to the level indicating glycemically defined new-onset diabetes as derived from records in their EMR. At sites performing the Intervention component of the study, all enrolled participants will have the Enriching New-onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC) score calculated using age, body weight and glucose or glycated hemoglobin values in their EMR. Patients with high ENDPAC score (\>0) are approached for informed consent to participate in up to two imaging studies by computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to imaging, participants will be asked to complete a study questionnaire. At sites that do not perform the Intervention component of the study, participants will be identified, enrolled, and followed by EMR data only. All enrolled participants are followed for development of PDAC.

This study is performed at locations with broad (institutional) consent for use of patient EMR information for research studies. Passive follow-up by EMR will occur for three years following enrollment. Any patient that has declined participation in EMR-based research at the institution is not included in the study.
