A Clinical Study of [177Lu]Lu-XT117 Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-center, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dosimetry and preliminary efficacy of \[177Lu\]Lu-XT117 injection in patients with FAP-positive advanced solid tumors. Dose escalation will be conducted to determine the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), and to assess dosimetry characteristics.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: [177Lu]Lu-XT117
Treatment emergent adverse events, Incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events will be assessed as per CTCAE v5.0)., Until 6 months after the last administration|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period, A DLT is defined as any drug-related toxicity that fulfills certain criteria predescribed in the study protocol., Up to 6 weeks after the first administration|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD will be determined by 3+3 dose escalation design., Up to 6 weeks after the first administration|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D will be determined on the basis of data indicating adequate tolerability and therapeutic effectiveness, and appropriate dosimestry. RP2D may be at or below the MTD., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as measured by RECIST v1.1., Every 6 weeks after first administration until disease progression or through study completion, assessed up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first radiologically documented disease progression or death due to disease according to RECIST v1.1., Every 6 weeks after first administration until disease progression or death or through study completion, assessed up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1, Every 6 weeks after first administration until disease progression or through study completion, assessed up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval from the date of first dosing to the date of first demonstrated disease progression, or to the last date of known progression-free condition of the patient, or to the date of death (based on RECIST 1.1)., Every 6 weeks after first administration until disease progression or death or through study completion, assessed up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from the date of first dosing to the date of death for any cause, or to the last date of known survival., Every 6 weeks after first administration until death, assessed up to 2 years|Radiation dosimetry of [177Lu]Lu-XT117 to whole body, lesions, organs, and selected regions of interest, Radiation dosimetry is assessed by SPECT/CT and/or planar images., 1、4、24、48、72 and 168 hours after first administration
