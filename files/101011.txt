Registrational Trial to Compare Effectiveness of Two Digital Software Medical Devices as Adjunctive Oncology Treatment
This is a non-significant risk, double-blinded, randomized, registrational study to compare the effectiveness of two digital, software only, medical devices (SaMD) (attune™ and cerena™) in reducing cancer-related anxiety and depression symptoms when used adjunctively with multidisciplinary (medical, psychosocial) oncology usual care regimens for up to 10 weeks.

Study population will consist of up to 553 participants with stage I-III breast cancer or stage I-III NSCLC. The primary endpoint is percent improvement in anxiety symptoms at Week 10 and secondary endpoints of percent improvement in depressive symptoms will be assessed at Week 12.

An interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once 236 participants have completed the study.

Quality of life via PROMIS-Global Health v1.2, The PROMIS Global Health measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. The measures are generic, rather than disease-specific, and often use an "In General" item context as it is intended to globally reflect individuals' assessment of their health. The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health (Promis-Global Health Scoring Manual, 2017). Higher scores for responses always indicate better health., Weeks 10 and Week 12|Patient self-efficacy via the Patient Activation Measure-13 (PAM-13), Patient Activation Measures-the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage one's health is associated with improved self-management behaviors in cancer patients. A patient activation measure (PAM) using PAM-13 will be used to assess participant engagement at baseline after PROMIS-A and PROMIS-D are completed and at Week 10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy., Weeks 10|Patient self-efficacy via the Measurement of Current Status (MOCS) Part A and Part B, The Measure of Current Status (MOCS) scale comes from research on the effects of a multi-modal cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention on the psychosocial well-being of cancer patients. The MOCS has two sections. Part A is items measuring participants' current self-perceived status on several skills that are targeted by the intervention: the ability to relax at will, recognize stress-inducing situations, restructure maladaptive thoughts, be assertive about needs, and choose appropriate coping responses as needed. Part B assesses potential "nonspecific effects" of the intervention: feelings of normalcy vs. alienation, sense of cohesiveness with other patients, perceptions of care from persons around them, and a sense of being better off than other cancer patients. All items were framed in such a way that they are sensible to participants in both conditions. MOCS measurements will be taken at Baseline, Week 6, and Week 10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy., Baseline, Week 6, and Week 10|Immune cell transcription, Analyses will focus on inflammatory gene expression and related gene regulation pathways due to their established relevance for disease progression/recurrence in the aftermath of cancer diagnosis and treatment, and their role in promoting symptoms of depression or anxiety via effects on central nervous system function, Baseline up to Week 12
