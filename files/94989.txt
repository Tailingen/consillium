Carbon-11 Labeled Sarcosine in Prostate Cancer
Men with and without prostate cancer will have a PET/CT scan that measures the level of the amino acid sarcosine. PET is a scanning method that uses short lived radioactivity.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 11C-sarcosine|DRUG: 11C-choline
Evaluation of biodistribution of 11C-sarcosine in prostate cancer patients, One Month|Evaluation of radiation dosimetry of 11C-sarcosine in healthy volunteers, One Month
Comparison of the uptake measures of 11C-sarcosine with those from 11C-choline, Standardized uptake (SUV) values from tumor tissues relative to background, also called tumor-to-background ratios (TBR), will be determined from both, 11C-sarcosine and 11C-choline. Then TBR measurements from 11C-choline and 11C-sarcosine will be compared to identify whether 11C-sarcosine improves tumor to background image contrast relative to 11C-choline in prostate cancer., One Month|Evaluation of underlying metabolic pathways of sarcosine in prostate cancer tissues obtained from tissue materials, One Month|Evaluation of the relationship between sarcosine (and metabolite) tissue concentrations and 11C-sarcosine/11C-choline plasma and tissue uptake measures, One Month
Tissue levels of the amino acid sarcosine are elevated in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissues and further increased in metastases from prostate cancer. This research project is designed to test whether 11C-sarcosine (a chemical that is linked to short lived radioactivity) would be useful to detect prostate cancer in men using PET/CT imaging. The uptake and distribution of 11C-sarcosine in men with known or suspected prostate cancer will be determined and compared with results from 11C-choline PET/CT.
