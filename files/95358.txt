Feasibility and Functionality of fPAM Imaging in Melanoma
Melanoma is a cutaneous malignancy that has the potential for local (skin) and regional (lymph node) recurrence. These recurrences may be difficult to detect in their earliest stages. We are attempting to use novel form of skin imaging that uses ultrasound combined with laser to identify these recurrences early, when they may be most amenable to treatment. This imaging will detect melanoma pigment below the surface of the skin and in the draining lymph nodes, as well as new blood vessel formation that occurs with these loco-regional metastases.

fPAM is a hybrid imaging technique that detects absorbed diffuse photons ultrasonically through the photoacoustic (PA) effect, Evaluate pigmented lesions for depth, width, total hemoglobin saturation, melanin distribution, and melanin concentration using fPAM in vivo and ex vivo, baseline
recruiting healthy individuals with pigmented lesions and individuals with melanoma and pigmented lesions
