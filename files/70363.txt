Irinotecan, Carboplatin and Radiation Therapy Followed by Bevacizumab in Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
In this multicenter trial, we plan to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of initial treatment with irinotecan/carboplatin/radiation therapy, followed by treatment with bevacizumab, in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|RADIATION: Radiation
Number of Grade 3/4 Toxicities Patients Experienced on Maintenance Bevacizumab Following Chemoradiation for Limited Stage - Small Cell Lung Cancer (LS-SCLC), Toxicity was evaluated in all patients who received at least 1 dose of therapy, and graded according to CTCAE v. 3., 18 months
2-Year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the date of study entry until the date of tumor progression or death. 2-Year PFS is the percentage of patients alive and without progressive disease (PD) 2 years from the date of study entry., 24 months|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is the percentage of patients with complete response or partial response per RECIST v.1 Criteria. Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions, disappearance of all nontarget lesions for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response (PR) = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters., 18 month
Upon determination of eligibility, all patients will be receive:

* Irinotecan + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy + Bevacizumab

Patients will receive 4 courses of irinotecan/carboplatin. Radiation therapy will begin concurrently with the third course of chemotherapy. The intervals between chemotherapy courses will be 21 days except for the interval between the third and fourth courses (during radiation therapy), which will be 28 days.
