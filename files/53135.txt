A Combination Clinical Study of PLX3397 and Pembrolizumab To Treat Advanced Melanoma and Other Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how PLX3397 and pembrolizumab work together to affect cancer cells.

PLX3397 is designed to target the receptor for CSF1 (CSF1R). Pembrolizumab is designed to block the interaction between the receptor PD-1 and molecules that bind PD-1. In this study, PLX3397 and pembrolizumab are being given together in order to study their combined effects on patients' immune responses to their tumors. Tumor-specific immune responses have been shown to kill cancer cells and/or to stop tumors from growing.

Part 1 of the study (dose-escalation phase) will establish the safest dose of PLX3397 to be given in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 of the study (expansion phase) will include an evaluation of efficacy of this combination in the following tumor types:

* Advanced melanoma: prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy but never responded
* Advanced melanoma: prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and responded but later progressed as defined by irRECIST while on therapy
* Non-small cell lung cancer
* Ovarian cancer
* Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
* Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck

DRUG: PLX3397|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in Participants Regardless of Causality While Taking PLX3397 in Combination With Pembrolizumab, Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in participants regardless of causality while taking PLX3397 in combination with pembrolizumab are reported, 1 year (Dose Escalation); 2 years (Dose Expansion)
Summary of the Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate Assessed by RECIST v1.1 During Pembrolizumab and PLX3397, Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best disease response of either Complete or Partial (CR or PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed generally by MRI, CT, or PET-CT and are summarized as: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Participants who discontinued study therapy due to clinical progression, radiographic progression, or death without the required tumor assessments were considered to be non-responders in the Objective Response Rate (ORR) calculation. The efficacy analysis included all subjects with baseline tumor measurements who received at least 1 dose of study drug., 1 year (Dose Escalation); 2 years (Dose Expansion)
