Prospective Cohort Study for Analyzing the Effect of Gastric Cancer Surgery to the Metabolic Syndrome and Insulin Resistance
Gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignance in Korea. Because of the popularity of regular check ups, early detection of gastric cancer has increased, consequently, the survival of the patients also has increased. In this reason, the interest of outcomes after gastrectomy for gastric cancer move survival only to quality of life of these patients.

Although the definition of metabolic syndrome is various, but it is normally accepted as a state that insulin resistance or glucose intolerance combined with hypertension or hyperlipidemia or obesity. Metabolic syndrome is a worldwide health problem, and the treatment is modification of life style, weight loss and medication. However, in most of the patients metabolic syndrome is considered not curable disease. Recent studies have shown that some bariatric surgery offers not only control the overweight but also metabolic syndrome. The exact mechanism is still unknown but decreased gastric volume and intestinal bypass itself seemed to play an important role to improve metabolic syndrome over just decreased weight.

For treating gastric cancer, gastrectomy is essential and the extent of gastrectomy is varied subtotal and total gastrectomy according to the location of tumor. Also, reconstruction type is varied gastroduodenostomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after subtotal gastrectomy, esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy. This kind of operation for gastric cancer lead decreased gastric volume and/or intestinal bypass, which means this operation could lead similar effect of bariatric surgery. Already, there have been several retrospective reports that metabolic syndrome or diabetes was improved after gastrectomy for gastric cancer but no prospective study about this subject yet in Korea.

The purpose of this study is that evaluating the degree of improvement of metabolic syndrome after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and analyze the differences between the type of operation.
