The Impact of Climate Environment in Different Latitudes on the Occurrence of PICC Complications
In this study, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group through randomization (1:1). Under the guidance of electrocardiographic Doppler ultrasound guided puncture and catheterization (EDUG) technology, the tunnel puncture method was compared with the conventional puncture method. The two groups of patients were observed and evaluated intraoperative and postoperative 7 ± 3 days, 30 ± 7 days, 60 ± 10 days, and 90 ± 10 days 120 ± 10 days (if any) and the occurrence of complications during extubation or unplanned extubation at the end of treatment, comparing cases in the north and south, as well as complications related to different catheterization methods
