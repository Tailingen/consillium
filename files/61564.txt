Evaluation of EGFR TKI Resistance Mechanism Using Plasma DNA Analysis
To detect resistance gene from serially collected plasma DNA in non-small cell lung cancer harbouring EGFR activating mutation who are being treated with EGFR TKIs by using castPCR method.
EGFR Mutation Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, et al)
detection of resistant gene, To evaluate the efficiency of castPCR method for detection of resistance genes, especially, T790M mutation from serially collected plasma DNA in non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring EGFR activating mutation who are being treated with EGFR TKIs, 24 months
