Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: DS-3201b|DRUG: irinotecan
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase l) of DS-3201/Valemetostat, Will employ a standard 3-by-3 dose-escalation phase I study design to investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DS-3201b/valemetostat in combination with fixed dose irinotecan. The study population for Phase I dose-escalation will include only patients who complete at least 1 full cycle of treatment (including the initial 7-day safety run-in and the complete 21-days of Cycle 1); only these patients will be considered evaluable for DLT and determination of the MTD., 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Phase II), The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group (RECIST v1.1) criteria will be used to evaluate the response to treatment, 1 year
