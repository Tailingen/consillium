FOLFOX6m Plus SIR-Spheres Microspheres vs FOLFOX6m Alone in Patients With Liver Mets From Primary Colorectal Cancer
This study is a randomized, multi-center study that will compare the efficacy and safety of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using SIR-Spheres microspheres plus a standard chemotherapy regimen of FOLFOX6m versus FOLFOX6m alone as first-line therapy in patients with non-resectable liver metastases from primary colorectal carcinoma.

Treatment with the biologic agent bevacizumab, if part of the standard of care at participating institutions, is allowed within this study at the discretion of the Investigator.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: FOLFOX6m|DEVICE: SIR-Spheres microspheres
Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause assessed up 3 yrs 8 months
Progression-free Survival, PFS defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as an increase in the sum of the longest diameters of ≥ 20% and an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of ≥ 5 mm, or the appearance of a new lesion., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years 8 months.
