Study of Ociperlimab Plus Tislelizumab Plus Chemoradiotherapy in Participants With Untreated Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase 2 trial examined whether the preliminary efficacy and safety of ociperlimab, tislelizumab, and cCRT when used in combination is expected to advance treatment options in the serious unmet medical need population of Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (LS-SCLC) participants .
