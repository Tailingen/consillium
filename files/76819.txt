The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of NK042 for treatment of malignant ascites.
Gynecologic Cancer
DRUG: NK042
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), The occurrence of DLTs will be observed from the first intraperitoneal infusion of NK042 to 28 days after infusion., 28 Days
ascites volume, Five-point method to measure ascites volume(base on CT)., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 6 months).|Time to next therapeutic puncture，TTpu, The time to the next puncture/drainage, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) to the next puncture/drainage (up to 6 months)|Puncture-free survival, PuFS, The time to the next puncture/drainage or death, From the time of of first dosing (Day 1) to the next puncture/drainage or death (up to 6 months)|Progression-free Survival, PFS, The time to disease progression assessed by the imaging evaluation or toxicity or death, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance or death (up to 6 months).|Overall survival, OS, The time to death, From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until death (up to 6 months).
This is a phase 1 ,open-label , Single Arm,dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary efficacy of NK042 in patients with treatment of malignant ascites caused by Gynecologic Cancer.About 3-9 subjects are planned to be enrolled, Subjects will receive intraperitoneal infusion of NK042 once a week (D0、D7、D14)for 2 cycles, with 3 times during each cycle and a total of 6 infusions. The occurrence of DLTs will be observed from the first intraperitoneal infusion of NK042 to 28 days after infusion.
