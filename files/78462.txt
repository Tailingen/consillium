Therapeutical Assessment of Compression Armsleeves for Lymphatic Indications
Examination of therapeutical effects of different types of armsleeves in treating lymphatic diseases after breast cancer surgery during maintenance phase

1. thesis:

   - all types should be equal regarding volume reduction
2. thesis: armsleeves manufactured with microfibre yarn are expected to be

   * better in wearing comfort and
   * better in handling features.

change of volume (arm and hand together), During a 2-weeks-phase the volume of patients arm and hand together is measured once a week, e.g. 3 times (beginning, after 1 week, at the end).

This is done with armsleeves of the first type. After one week of sedation the test will be repeated with the second product.

Randomization is given by chance, that during first phase product of type A or type B can be applied. During second phase then vice versa.

The measurements were performed by an "inverse water plethysmography device" (later: inverse watervolumetry) desinged by R. Damstra., 6 weaks per patient
Clinical judgement of skin status, clinical judgement of skin status with photo documentation, clinical finding (as palpation,check on fibrosclerosis, skin clour, skin surface, edema, tenderness, tissue consistency...), check of skin contamination, 6 weaks per patient|Wearing comfort and handling features of armsleeves, For both types of products questionaires are prepared to find out how patients are feeling with their armsleeves.It is asked for problems during donning procedure as well as during wearing period. This will be done in the beginning after 1 week and after 2 weeks for both types.

At the end the study nurses are asked to their impression regarding patients acceptance of the armsleeves.

Method: VAS score, 6 weeks per patient
1. thesis:

   * measuring of arm volume by "inverse water-volumetry" (see later)
   * measuring of circumference cD
   * measuring of circumference cG
   * photodocumentation in 2 positions(during each round)
2. thesis

   * questionaire for patients

     * in the beginning
     * after 1 week
     * after 2 weeks (at the end of a wearing period)
   * questionaire for study nurse (at the end of a wearing period)
