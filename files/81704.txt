An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Effectiveness of Anti-LAG-3 With and Without Anti-PD-1 in the Treatment of Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of experimental medication BMS-986016 administered alone and in combination with nivolumab in patients with solid tumors that have spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery.

The following tumor types are included in this study:

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma, that have NOT previously been treated with immunotherapy. NSCLC and melanoma that HAVE previously been treated with immunotherapy.
