Trial Comparing Niraparib-bevacizumab-Dostarlimab and Niraparib-bevacizumab to Standard of Care in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
ENGOT-OV42 / NSGO-AVATAR: This three-arm randomized trial is to demonstrate efficacy of niraparib-bevacizumab-dostarlimab triplet combination against standard of care treatment and to demonstrate efficacy of niraparib-bevacizumab-dostarlimab triplet combination against niraparib-bevacizumab doublet combination for patients with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer
