A Phase I Pilot Study Comparing 123I MIP 1072 Versus 111In Capromab Pendetide in Subjects With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This is an open-label study comparing the imaging characteristics of 123-I-MIP-1072 and ProstaScint® (111-In-capromab pendetide)in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Eligible patients will receive a dose of 123-I-MIP-1072 and have imaging studies and safety assessments (physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests) performed during the subsequent 24 hours. Two weeks later, patients will return for additional safety assessments and will receive ProstaScint® if they don't already have a pre-existing ProstaScint scan. Final assessments will be performed two weeks after the ProstaScint® scan unless there is a difference between the 123-I-MIP-1072 and ProstaScint® scans. If this is the case, another dose of 123-I-MIP-1072 will be given 12 weeks later, and imaging studies repeated.
