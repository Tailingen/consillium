Clonal Hematopoiesis of Immunological Significance
Ambispective, national, multicenter observational cohort study aimed at characterizing the satellite dysimmune manifestations of clonal hematopoiesis, including Vexas (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory and Somatic) syndrome.

The clinical spectrum of dysimmune manifestations associated with blood diseases is wide. The pathophysiology of these manifestations is not well understood and their management is poorly codified. This observational cohort aims to list the different clinical pictures, the therapeutic management and the prognosis of patients according to the type of dysimmune manifestations and the type of hemopathy. We wish to have an inventory of the demographic, genetic, clinical and evolutionary data of patients with an inflammatory manifestation associated or not with a myeloid or lymphoid hemopathy. This will make it possible to establish quantitative data on the morbidity and mortality of these rare diseases and to propose therapeutic trials for the most serious patients.
