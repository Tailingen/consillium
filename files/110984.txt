Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Quality of Recovery in Non-functioning Pituitary Adenoma Patients Undergoing Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery
In multiple previous studies that have explored the use of dexmedetomidine in transsphenoidal tumor resection surgery, dexmedetomidine showed many beneficial effects like reducing the requirement of analgesics and anesthetics, improving hemodynamic stability and decreasing the emergence time, extubation time and visual analog scale at emergence. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would decrease neuroendocrine stress response and improve the quality of postoperative recovery.
