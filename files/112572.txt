LIQUIK: LIQUId Biopsy for Detection of Actionable Genomic BiomarKers in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
To explore the non-inferiority of a cfDNA amplicon-based liquid biopsy technology vs. standard of care tissue biopsy-based NGS in detecting guideline- recommended biomarkers in patients with metastatic non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), amongst other endpoints.

To explore the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based LiquidHALLMARK test vs. cfDNA-based liquid biopsy competitor, both qualitatively and quantitatively for actionable mutation (percentage of allele frequency) profile results in a population of subjects who have at least one actionable mutation detected by tissue biopsy.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based LiquidHALLMARK liquid biopsy assay vs. SOC tissue biopsy based NGS assay for mutation profile results, Explore the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based LiquidHALLMARK liquid biopsy assay vs. SOC tissue biopsy based NGS assay for mutation profile results in a population of subjects who have at least one of nine actionable genes (G9) - EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK fusions, MET, BRAF, ERBB2 and KRAS- detected by tissue biopsy., 34 months
