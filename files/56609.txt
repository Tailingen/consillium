First in Human Dose Escalation Study of Vactosertib (TEW-7197) in Subjects With Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
The phase I dose escalation study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the TGF-β pathway inhibitor TEW 7197 in subjects with advanced, refractory solid tumors.
Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
DRUG: TEW-7197
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 DLT, 28 days
Dose-dependency of toxicity based on: dose limiting toxicities; frequency, type, grade, and seriousness, and causality of treatment-emergent adverse events, and laboratory assessments., while undergoing study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of TEW-7197
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, phase I study of TEW-7197 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TEW-7197, and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TEW-7197 using a 3 + 3 design. An expansion phase at the MTD will identify the recommended phase 2 dose, with an emphasis on subjects with melanoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate cancer. TEW-7197 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits protein serine/threonine kinase of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and blocks intracellular signaling of TGF-β by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ALK5 substrates.
