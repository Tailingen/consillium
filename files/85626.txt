Predictive Factors for Medullary Thyroid Cancer Aggressiveness
This study is a retrospective study trying to find the predictive factors for medullary thyroid aggressiveness in terms of tumor metastasis and patients' survival.
Medullary Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Total Thyroidectomy
Central lymph node metastasis, Central neck compartment lymph node metastasis, Number of lymph node Metastasis found in preoperative imaging studies or up to 1 year postoperatively|Lateral lymph node metastasis, Lateral neck compartment lymph node metastasis, Number of lymph node Metastasis found in preoperative imaging studies or up to 1 year postoperatively|Distant metastasis, Liver and lung metastasis, Number of distant Metastasis found in preoperative imaging studies or up to 1 year postoperatively
Nuclear atypia as histological predictor of aggressiveness, nuclear atypia, The pathology report is held immediately after surgery|Amyloid as histological predictor of aggressiveness, amyloid, The pathology report is held immediately after surgery|Immunohistochemistry as histological predictor of aggressiveness, immunohistochemistry, The pathology report is held immediately after surgery|Desmoplasia as histological predictor of aggressiveness, desmoplasia, The pathology report is held immediately after surgery|CEA as Biochemical predictor of aggressiveness, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) preoperatively and up to 1 year postoperatively, pre and postoperative laboratory exams up to 1 year postoperatively|Calcitonin as Biochemical predictor of aggressiveness, calcitonin levels preoperatively and up to 1 year postoperatively, pre and postoperative laboratory exams up to 1 year postoperatively|White blood cell as Biochemical predictor of aggressiveness, white blood cell count, pre and postoperative laboratory exams up to 1 year postoperatively|Platelet count as Biochemical predictor of aggressiveness, platelet count, pre and postoperative laboratory exams up to 1 year postoperatively|CEA drop as Biochemical cure marker, CEA drop levels, up to 1 year postoperatively|Calcitonin drop as Biochemical cure marker, calcitonin drop levels, up to 1 year postoperatively
This study is a retrospective study trying to find the predictive factors for medullary thyroid aggressiveness in terms of tumor metastasis and patients' survival. The predictive factors included in this study are central and lateral compartment lymph node metastases as well as distant metastasis up to 1 year postoperatively, while biochemical predictors (meaning ratios such as lymphocyte to monocyte ratio etc and CEA and calcitonin drop levels) and histological predictors (such as nuclear atypia, amyloid, immunohistochemistry, desmoplasia) are included as secondary outcomes. In this study , patients \>18 years old that underwent surgery for medullary thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomy, completion thyroidectomy) +/- central/lateral neck dissection) will be enrolled.
