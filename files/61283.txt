POLA+BR for Relapsed or Refractory DLBCL
This is a phase II multicenter, open-label study of polatuzumab vedotin administered by IV infusion in combination with standard doses of bendamustine (B) and rituximab (R) in transplant-eligible patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. A total of 22 patients will be enrolled over a period of 2 years through the University of Colorado and additional study sites if applicable. Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycles for patients with DLBCL.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Polatuzumab Vedotin
Complete response at primary response, The assessment is based on PET/CT, as determined by the investigator, 3 weeks after last dose of study medication|objective response at primary response, assessment based on PET/CT as determined by the investigator, 3 weeks after last dose of study medication|duration of response (DOR) of combination therapy, DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR to the date of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause based on PET/CT or CT only as determined by the investigator assessment.Response assessment will be determined according to Modified Lugano Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Lugano Classification), 2 years of follow up|number of patients who underwent an ASCT, Determined during follow up, 2 years of follow up|Cell of Origin analysis, Cell of origin analysis will be based on immunohistochemistry analysis, 2 years of follow up|Differences in response rates based on timing of relapse, \<12 months of front-line R-chemotherapy versus \>12 months after front-line R-chemotherapy and bulky disease prior to ASCT (bulk defined as mass \> 7.5 cms), 2 years of follow up|c-Myc status, by FISH, 2 years of follow up|2-yr progression free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from date of first treatment to the first occurrence of progression or relapse, or death from any cause, based on PET/CT or CT only as determined by the investigator assessment, 2 years of follow up|overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization or first treatment to the date of death from any cause, 2 years of follow up|stem cell collection failure rate, Stem cells will be collected post primary response assessment. If patients achieve a PR after 3 cycles of Pola+BR and investigator decides to give additional cycles of Pola+BR (up to a max of 6 cycles) then stem cell collection may occur between cycles to minimize the chances of collection failure., 2 years of follow up
The first day of treatment will constitute Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients will be treated with a minimum of three cycles and up to a maximum of 6 cycles to optimize responses prior to ASCT based on investigator discretion.

All patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of assessments.

All patients will be assessed for response to treatment by the investigator with the use of standard criteria according to the Modified Lugano Response Criteria at the following time points:

* At the time of screening
* At the time of primary response assessment (3 weeks after completion of study treatment (i.e., 3 weeks after Cycle 3 Day 1 or after last dose of study medication)

Imaging at these timepoints must include FDG-PET (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) and a diagnostic-quality CT scan with both oral and IV contrast. A combined PET/CT scan is encouraged if feasible. CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans. In patients for whom contrast is contraindicated, (e.g., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance or patient denial), PET-CT scans without contrast are permitted so long as they permit consistent and precise measurement of target lesions during the study treatment period.

Patients will also be evaluated every 3 months for 2 years, or until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or initiation of another anti-cancer therapy. Tumor assessments should also be performed to confirm clinical suspicion of relapse or disease progression for documentation. The study will end when all patients enrolled have been followed until death, have withdrawn consent, have been lost to follow-up, until 2-year follow up, or the Sponsor-investigator decides to end the trial, whichever occurs first.
