Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|BIOLOGICAL: S-488210/S-488211
Occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (Phase 1b), Detailed adverse event monitoring will be conducted, assessed using CTCAE v5. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as any adverse event or laboratory abnormality detailed in the trial protocol, that has a reasonable possibility of being related to trial treatment and occurring at anytime during the DLT evaluation period (28 days from the first administration of S-488210/S-488211 on cycle 1 day 2)., At the end of cycle 1 (cycle 1 is 28 days)|Pathological Disease Free Survival Rate (DFSR) (Phase 2), Disease Free Survival will be calculated from start of trial treatment (cycle 1 day 1) until the time at which either primary disease is confirmed to have recurred, any secondary cancer is confirmed or death from any cause. The primary endpoint of Disease Free Survival Rate will be assessed at 1 year from start of treatment (and include patients that start trial treatment and receive combination treatment on cycle 2 day 1) and compared to the historical control rate of 20%., 1 year after start of treatment
1 year DFSR stratified by HLA-A*02:01, If the primary endpoint (DFSR) is statistically signification, comparison of DFSR at 1 year will be conducted between patients that are human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A\*02:01) positive versus negative., 1 year after start of treatment|5 year Overall Survival rate, Overall survival will be assessed from time of starting treatment to time of death from any cause., 5 years from start of treatment to date of death, if applicable.|5 year Overall Survival rate stratified by HLA-A*02:01, Overall survival will be assessed from time of starting treatment to time of death from any cause, stratified by HLA-A\*02:01 positive or negative., 5 years from start of treatment to date of death, if applicable.|Assessment of Quality of Life using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Quality of Life assessments will be undertaken using EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3) questionnaire using Likert score (26 questions scored: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much; 2 questions scored: 1-7, 1=very poor, 7=excellent) . Descriptions of mean change in EORTC QLQ scores will be presented and compared to baseline values from pre-treatment., Assessments will be performed at baseline (prior to starting treatment on cycle 1 days 1), every 12 weeks up to 12 months after start of treatment and 24 months after start of treatment.|Assessment of Quality of Life using EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 questions, Quality of Life assessments will be undertaken using EORTC QLQ-C30 which will include QLQ-NMIBC24 questions using Likert score (24 questions scored: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Descriptions of mean change in EORTC QLQ scores will be presented and compared to baseline values from pre-treatment., Assessments will be performed at baseline (prior to starting treatment on cycle 1 days 1), every 12 weeks up to 12 months after start of treatment and 24 months after start of treatment.|Assessment of Quality of Life using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, Quality of Life assessments will be undertaken using EQ-5D-5L (self-reported) questionnaire using a combination of Likert score (5 questions with 5 dimensions of abilities) and visual analogue score (scored 0-100, 0=worst, 100=best). Descriptions of mean change in EQ-5D-5L scores will be presented and compared to baseline values from pre-treatment., Assessments will be performed at baseline (prior to starting treatment on cycle 1 days 1), every 12 weeks up to 12 months after start of treatment and 24 months after start of treatment.
1 year DFSR stratified by PD-L1 status, DFSR at 1 year stratified, retrospectively, by PD-L1 status will be performed., 1 year after start of treatment|1 year DFSR stratified by baseline Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) status, DFSR at 1 year stratified, retrospectively, by TIL status (high, intermediate and low) to assess the distribution of a three-category variable (TIL status) over survival status., 1 year after start of treatment|5 year Overall Survival rate stratified by PD-L1 status and TIL status, Overall survival will be assessed from time of starting treatment to time of death from any cause, stratified by PD-L1 status and TIL status., 5 years from start of treatment to date of death, if applicable.|Correlation of plasma cytokine levels with 1 year DFSR, The association between DFSR at 1 year and plasma cytokine levels will be assessed using logistic regression, with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval reported., 1 year after start of treatment
DURANCE is a registered, phase Ib/II study in patients with surgically debulked bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive (resistant or relapsing) or intolerant non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NIMBC). Patients will receive up to 24 weeks of durvalumab (a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor) in combination with S-488210/S-488211 (a 5-peptide cancer vaccine).

Durvalumab will be given as 1500 mg IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 7 doses, in combination with S-488210/S-S488211 which will be administered as two subcutaneous injections of S-488210/Montanide and S-488211/Montanide starting the day after the first durvalumab dose, then weekly for 6 doses and every 2 weeks for a further 9 doses (up to a maximum of 16 doses).

All patients must have a cystoscopy at the end of week 12 (from start of trial treatment) for disease evaluation and to assess suitability to continue trial treatment. Patients with complete response, as shown from the cystoscopy, may continue treatment for up to 24 weeks in the absence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent; all other patient will be withdrawn from further trial treatment.

The phase Ib part of the DURANCE study will look to assess the safety and tolerability of the treatment combination of durvalumab + S-488210/S-488211 by reviewing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) which have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to the trial treatments (durvalumab and/or S-488210/S-488211). Up to 14 evaluable patients will be registered into phase Ib and provided the DLTs do not exceed the DLT thresholds defined in the trial protocol, the trial will proceed to the expansion phase of the study (phase 2). In phase 2 the trial will look to assess the disease free survival rate at 1 year following start of treatment.
