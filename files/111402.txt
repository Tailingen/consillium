A Composite Assay for HER2-positive Early-stage Breast Cancer Management
The goal of this observational study is to assess the prognostic value of a genomic classifier (S18) and its refined version (S\*) in women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The study aims to determine whether these tools can predict event-free (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients treated with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapies.

Event-free survival (EFS) and Disease-free survival (DFS) according to the value of S18 and S*, To assess the prognostic value of the gene expression based classifier, with or without the integration of clinical-pathological variables, in patients receiving neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab ± pertuzumab, with respect to event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS)., From the initiation of systemic therapy through to at least 3 years post-treatment.
Explorative evaluation of overall survival (OS) according to the value of S18 and S*, To assess the prognostic value of the gene expression based classifier, with or without the integration of clinical-pathological variables, in patients receiving neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab ± pertuzumab, with respect to overall survival (OS)., From the initiation of therapy through to at least 3 years post-treatment.|Evaluation of pathological complete response (pCR) according to the value of S18 and S*, To evaluate the predictive value of the gene expression based classifier in relation to pathological complete response (i.e., absence of breast cancer cells in surgical specimens) following neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab ± pertuzumab., Assessed in the surgical specimen obtained from definitive surgery performed within up to 10 months of initiating neoadjuvant treatment.
The population includes women aged 18 or older with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer who received trastuzumab ± pertuzumab. Data and tumor tissue samples from this population have been collected prospectively from Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori IRCCS Fondazione Pascale, Naples (cohort A), and from Ospedale "Di Summa-Perrino", Brindisi (cohort B). The study integrates clinical-pathological and genomic data to refine and validate the prognostic capabilities of the S18 classifier.
