Combined F-18 NaF and F-18 FDG PET/CT for Evaluation of Malignancy
Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET/CT is established as a powerful imaging tool for cancer detection and monitoring response to therapy. Sodium Fluorine-18 (F-18) was used in the 1970s for bone scanning and can be used as a skeletal tracer in current PET/CT scanners. The combined administration of F-18 and F-18 FDG in a single PET/CT scan for cancer detection was not attempted to date. We hope to learn what is the best approach for detection of cancer and thus to improve cancer treatment.
