Cancer Stem Cell Assay Directed Chemotherapy in Recurrent Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this clinical study is to confirm the utility of chemosensitivity (ChemoID) tumor testing on cancer stem cells as a predictor of clinical response in recurrent platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

Population studied will be female participants experiencing a recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (no mucinous, low grade serous, or pure sarcoma types), with ≤ 5 prior treatments, and a performance status 0-1.

This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine if recurrent platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with chemotherapy predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated with standard-of-care control therapy chosen by the physician.

Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (no mucinous, low grade serous, or pure sarcoma types), with ≤ 5 prior treatments, and a performance status 0-1 will have a tumor biopsy or a cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug response testing with multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment (chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from a provided list), or to a study arm of FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata based on number of prior platinum treatments and BRCA status to ensure balance within these cells.
