Primary Care-Based Follow-up of Cancer Survivors of the Prostate and Kidney
In France, the second cancer plan of 2009-2013 aimed to strengthen the role of MT by putting it back at the center of patient monitoring, in particular by asking "regional health agencies to encourage and support local experiments" which aim for better coordination between the city and the hospital. The third cancer plan for 2014-2019 insists on this measure because it had proven to be unproductive, and recommends, in addition to the creation of a nurse dedicated to the coordination of care between community medicine and the hospital, the creation of a direct telephone line to reach the hospital medical team. This measure is mainly aimed at the follow-up of certain cancers that do not require the technical support of the hospital, as is the case in the post-operative follow-up of RCC and CaP, where the additional examinations carried out during follow-up are carried out in the city.

The research hypothesis is that this new method of monitoring had a positive impact on care in terms of quality, accessibility, organization and costs.
