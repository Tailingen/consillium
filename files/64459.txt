Evaluation of Resection Techniques for Pancreatic Tumors
The objective of this study is to compare open and minimally invasive pancreatic and liver resection techniques and analyze the different outcome variables from the clinical standpoint.

The plan is to investigate patient survival, length of stay, complication rates, operative time, transfusion rate, 30 and 90-day readmission rate, and hospital charges.

PROCEDURE: Resection techniques for pancreatic and liver tumors
Patient Survival, It will be calculated in days.Minimally invasive techniques are being adopted for complex pancreatic and liver surgery and there is a need to understand if these techniques are advantageous to the patient, if the cost is justified and if the risks are acceptable when compared to the gold standard open surgery., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Length of stay, It will be calculated in days. The days stayed in hospital post-procedure., Up to 1 year|Complication rates, Patient may visit physician or hospital for any symptoms or may need hospitalizations., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Operative time, The time required for the procedure., up to 10 hours|Transfusion rate, If any post-procedure transfusion required, will be recorded., through study completion, an average of 1 year|30 and 90 day readmission rate, After the procedure any hospital admissions up to 30 days will be recorded., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Hospital charges, The hospital charges for the procedure will be recorded., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The plan is to conduct a retrospective chart review of patients who have undergone pancreatic and liver resection by using Meditech and Epic. A non-identified database will be created after retrospectively reviewing each patient case involving pancreatic or liver resection at MDMC. The study period will start in January 2006 until December 2020. Variables will include demographics, clinical disease diagnoses, and operative parameters as well as indirect charges from the hospitalizations.
