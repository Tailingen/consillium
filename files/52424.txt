Zanzalintinib Maintenance in Patients With High Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (HG-NENs)
The investigators hypothesize that zanzalintinib maintenance therapy after initial cytotoxic chemotherapy can prolong the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with high-grade NENs.
High Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms
DRUG: Zanzalintinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of initiation of zanzalintinib treatment to progression or death, whichever occurs first. The alive patients without progression are censored at the last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (up to 4 years)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR) is defined as partial response rate (PRR) + complete response rate (CRR) in patients who receive zanzalintinib, Through completion of follow-up (up to 4 years)|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of zanzalintinib treatment to the date of death, censored at the last follow-up otherwise., Through completion of follow-up (up to 4 years)|Number of participants with adverse events, From signing of informed consent through 30 days after last dose of zanzalintinib (estimated to be 37 months)
