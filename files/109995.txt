Study of BGB-A317 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Mature T- and NK-cell Neoplasms
This was a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BGB-A317 in participants with relapsed or refractory mature T- and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms. There were three cohorts:

* Cohort 1: Relapsed or refractory (R/R) extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL; nasal or non-nasal type)
* Cohort 2: Other R/R mature T-cell neoplasms, limited to the following histologies: peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), or anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL)
* Cohort 3: R/R cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, limited to mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sèzary syndrome (SS)

Study procedures included a Screening phase (up to 35 days); Treatment phase (until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first); Safety Follow-up phase (up to 90 days following last study treatment for all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)); and Survival follow-up phase (duration varying by participant).

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response or partial response as determined by the investigator using Lugano criteria with Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) modification for cohorts 1 and 2 and International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas/European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (ISCL/EORTC) guidelines for cohort 3., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response until progression or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator using Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification for cohorts 1 and 2 and ISCL/EORTC guidelines for cohort 3., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first study drug administration to the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator using Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification for cohorts 1 and 2 and ISCL/EORTC guidelines for cohort 3., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from first study drug administration to the date of death due to any reason for cohorts 1 and 2., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week|Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response or complete metabolic response as best overall response as assessed by the investigator using Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification for cohorts 1 and 2 and ISCL/EORTC guidelines for cohort 3., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response defined as the time from first study drug administration to the time the response criteria (complete response or partial response) are first met as assessed by the investigator using Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification for cohorts 1 and 2 and ISCL/EORTC guidelines for cohort 3., Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week|Quality of Life Assessment: EQ-5D-5L Change From Baseline in Visual Analogue Score, Mean change from baseline at safety follow-up visit in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue score (VAS). The EQ-5D-5L measures health outcomes using a VAS to record a participant's self-rated health on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is 'the best health you can imagine' and 0 is 'the worst health you can imagine.' An increasing score indicates improvements from baseline., Baseline and on Day 1 in Cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 (21 days per cycle) and safety follow-up visit (up to 30 days after end of treatment; up to approximately 3 years and 1 week)|Quality of Life Assessment: EORTC QLQ-C30 Change From Baseline in Global Health Status Score, Mean change from baseline at safety follow-up visit in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life score. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of cancer patients and includes global health status and quality of life questions related to their overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Answers are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status., Baseline and on Day 1 in Cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 (21 days per cycle) and safety follow-up visit (up to 30 days after end of treatment; up to approximately 3 years and 1 week)|Quality of Life Assessment: EORTC QLQ-C30 Change From Baseline in Fatigue Score, Mean change from baseline at safety follow-up visit in EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue score. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of cancer patients and includes questions related to fatigue symptoms in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Answers are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status., Baseline and on Day 1 in Cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 (21 days per cycle) and safety follow-up visit (up to 30 days after end of treatment; up to approximately 3 years and 1 week)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and vital signs, Up to approximately 3 years and 1 week
