Study of Recombinant Human Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
To investigate the safety and tolerability of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced solid tumors (mainly gastric cancer, esophageal cancer).

To investigate the preliminary relationship between the expression of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) and efficacy.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: GLS-010
Safety and tolerability of GLS-010 by assessing the percentage of participants who experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To investigate the safety and tolerance profile tolerance profile and the preliminary anti-tumor activity of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced solid tumors ( gastric cancer, esophageal cancer), 28 days after patient enrolled
Dose Escalation: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of GLS-010, To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GLS-010, within 2 years after patient enrolled|severity, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results, within 2 years of last patient enrolled|Dose Escalation: Maximum concentration (Cmax) of GLS-010, To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GLS-010, within 2 years after patient enrolled|Dose Escalation: Half life Period (t1/2) of GLS-010, To characterize the Ppharmacokinetics(K) profile of GLS-010, within 2 years after patient enrolled
The percent of PD-1 receptor occupancy, To assess PD-1 receptor occupancy of GLS-010, within 2 years of last patient enrolled
Dose escalation study: Primary purpose: To investigate the safety and tolerability of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced solid tumors (mainly gastric cancer, esophageal cancer). Secondary purpose: 1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GLS-010; 2. To determine dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for GLS-010; 3. To assess the preliminary anti tumor activity of GLS-010; 4. To assess programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor occupancy. Exploratory purpose: 1. To investigate the preliminary relationship between the expression of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) /PD-L2 and efficacy; 2. To characterize immunogenicity of GLS-010. Expansion study: Primary purpose: To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced solid tumors(gastric cancer, esophageal cancer); Secondary purpose: 1. To further assess the safety and tolerability of GLS-010; 2. To further assess the safety and tolerability of GLS-010 in subjects with advanced tumors. Exploratory purpose: 1. To assess PD-1 receptor occupancy of GLS-010; 2. To assess the relationship between the expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 and efficacy; 3. To further assess the immunogenicity of GLS-010.
