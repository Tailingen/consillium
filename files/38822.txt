Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well allogeneic stem cell transplant works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
Kidney Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: cyclosporine|DRUG: fludarabine phosphate|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
Survival rate at 18 months|Objective rate of response|Post-transplant immunological reactions and recuperation|Antitumoral activity
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the 18-month survival rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
* Determine the objective rate of response of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine post-transplant immunological reactions and recuperation of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the antitumoral activity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on availability of a compatible family member for stem cell transplantation.

* Group I: Patients with a compatible family donor receive conditioning chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV once daily on days -5 to -1. Patients undergo filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive immunosuppression therapy with cyclosporine beginning on day -2. Patients who have persistent or progressive disease, mixed chimerism, and no evidence of grade 2 or greater graft-vs-host disease, and have been off immunosuppression therapy for 1-2 weeks receive donor lymphocyte infusion on days 7 and 21.
* Group II: Patients without a compatible family donor receive treatment (immunotherapy, vaccination therapy, or chemotherapy) at the discretion of the treating physician.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 170 patients (60 patients for group I and 110 patients for group II) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
