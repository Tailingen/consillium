Intra-tumor Injection of Oncolytic Viruses H101 Combined With or Without Radiotherapy in Refractory/Recurrent Gynecological Malignancies
The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oncolytic viruses H101 intra-tumor injection combined with or without radiotherapy in refractory or recurrent gynecological malignancies. And further research the mechanism of oncolytic viruses H101.
Genital Neoplasms, Female
DRUG: H101
Local Control (LC), LC will be measured from the start date of injection until the date of progressive disease, 3 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants with presence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR). ORR assessment will be based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, 1 year after injection|Progress free survival (PFS), Progress free survival is defined as the time from first day of injection until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause, 12 months|adverse events, Toxicity were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, At day 3, 7 and 30
Patients with recurrent, radiation/chemotherapy-resistant gynecological cancer carry a poor prognosis. H101 is a recombinant human type-5 adenovirus (Ad5), in which the E1B and E3 gene have been deleted. Previous studies have shown that H101 has anticancer activity and safety in some solid tumors, but has little report in gynecological oncology. In this clinical trial, 60 recurrent or refractory gynecological cancer patients will be enrolled. Based on individual conditions, all eligible patients are intra-tumor injected oncolytic viruses H101 within 5 consecutive days combined with or without radiotherapy in sequential, three weeks for a cycle (1-4 cycles totally). Simultaneously, the tumor sample, peripheral blood, and urine specimen were collected on day1 and day5. Local control rate and side effects are recorded respectively.
