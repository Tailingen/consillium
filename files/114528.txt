Pain Reduction, The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain score will be used to assess pre- and post-procedural pain. The scale is from 1 to 10 with 1 indicating no pain and 10 indicating extreme pain., 6 months
ovarian perfusion, Ultrasound doppler imaging will be used to assess changes in ovarian perfusion post-intervention compared to baseline ultrasound imaging, 6 months
Uterine fibroids are the most common tumor type in women of reproductive age and may be associated with abnormal menstrual bleeding, pain, sub-fertility, and diminished quality of life. For women interested in uterine preservation who want to derive adequate relief from medical management, uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a treatment option. The goal of this study is to assess of Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery on fibroid treatment in patients undergoing UFE.
