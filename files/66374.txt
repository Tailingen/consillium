A Study to Evaluate P1101 in Japanese PV Patients
This is a Phase 3 single arm study to investigate efficacy and safety of P1101's rapid titration for adult Japanese patients with PV.

Eligible patients will be treated with P1101, starting at 250 μg. A starting dose of P1101 is 250 mcg, an intermediate dose is 350 mcg, and a target dose is 500 mcg. As such, subjects will not be exposed to below optimal doses within the first 4 weeks. The maximum recommended single dose is 500 μg injected every two weeks.

A primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of phlebotomy-free complete hematologic response (CHR) at Week 24, where CHR is defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved a CHR and have not required phlebotomy in the previous 12 weeks. A responder for the primary endpoint is defined as meeting all of the following criteria at Week 24: Hct (\<45%), WBC (≤10 x 10\^9/L), and PLT (≤400 x 10\^9/L).
