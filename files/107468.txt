Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Healing Abdominal Incision in Obese Patients Undergoing Breast Reconstruction Surgery
This trial studies the safety and how well negative pressure wound therapy works in healing the abdominal incision in obese patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction surgery. Using negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) instead of standard dressing (bandages) may improve wound healing at the surgical site in the abdomen where tissue was collected for breast reconstruction surgery.

Rate of wound dehiscence, Will measure and compare the wound healing outcomes of patients. All adverse events will be identified, graded for severity and assigned causality, reported to the required entities, and compiled for periodic review. After assigning causality, the principal investigator will decide the course of action for the study participant., Up to 3 months|Wound healing complications, Will measure and compare the wound healing outcomes of patients. All adverse events will be identified, graded for severity and assigned causality, reported to the required entities, and compiled for periodic review. After assigning causality, the principal investigator will decide the course of action for the study participant., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the impact of negative pressure wound therapy on wound healing as measured by wound dehiscence rate.

II. Long-term follow-up on wound healing complications.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Patients receive wound care with a standard dressing (bandage) after surgery for 7 days.

GROUP II: Patients receive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after surgery for 7 days.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and at 1 and 3 months.
