Continuation of TKI With or Without Chemotherapy Beyond Gradual Progression
There have been reports suggesting that continuous administration of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is advantageous for patients in which gradual disease progression was observed after the establishment of clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs. However, whether EGFR TKI with or without chemotherapy provides more survival benefit has not been formally evaluated.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor|DRUG: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor with chemotherapy
Progression free survival, up to 18 months
Objective response rate cacy, up to 18 months
Quality of life, up to 24 months
We design this clinical trial to compare the efficacy of continuation of EGFR TKI with or without chemotherapy in patients beyond gradual progression.
