Continuous Lenalidomide Therapy Versus Observation Following Induction Without Lenalidomide, Pomalidomide or Thalidomide in Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to see how long lenalidomide therapy can maintain or improve the disease response obtained after induction therapy that does not include lenalidomide, pomalidomide or thalidomide; and consequently reduce worsening of disease and to evaluate the activity of lenalidomide. Patients will receive lenalidomide or be under observation. All patients will attend regular clinic visits to evaluate their disease and health. Patients will have the option to participate in additional biomarker correlative studies in addition to their participation in the main study.
