Durvalumab, an Anti-PDLI Antibody, and Tremelimumab, an Anti-CTLA4 Antibody, and Chemoradiation Before Surgery for Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of adding a new drug, durvalumab (also called MEDI4736), to chemoradiation with either FOLFOX/Capeox or carboplatin and paclitaxel, following initial chemotherapy with FOLFOX. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this combination has on the patient and cancer.

BIOLOGICAL: durvalumab|DRUG: carboplatin AUC 2/paclitaxel|RADIATION: External beam radiation (EBRT)|PROCEDURE: esophagogastrectomy|DRUG: Tremelimumab
unacceptable toxicity, "Unacceptable toxicity" is defined as any of the following toxicities: \>1 episode of grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia \<75,000/μL (despite prior dose reduction) during chemoradiation any toxicity that results in \>2 week cumulative delay in chemoradiation any toxicity that is attributed to durvalumab which results in a delay of \>8 weeks in surgery, i.e. surgery \>16 weeks from the end of radiation, for a potentially operable patient any reason that is attributed to durvalumab which leads to death within 30 days of surgery. All toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.0.3., 1 year|pathologic complete response rate, 1 year
overall survival (OS), 3 years
Patients will undergo a baseline PET/CT scan prior to receiving mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy (bolus 5-fluorouracil or -FU 400 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 and infusional 5-FU 1,200 mg/m2/day ×46 hours) q14 days ×2, followed by repeat PET scan.

Two weeks after the second dose of mFOLFOX6, patients receive 1 dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg. and tremelimumab 300 mg. Two weeks later, all patients will initiate radiation (1.8 Gy/fraction ×23 fractions Monday through Friday for total dose of 41 Gy). PET responders receive concurrent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 q14 days ×3 doses with either infusional 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day ×96 hours or capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID Monday through Friday throughout the radiation period. PET non-responders receive concurrent carboplatin AUC 2/paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly ×5 with concurrent. All patients receive a second dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg q28 days after the first dose.

Patients undergo surgical resection 6-10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. In the adjuvant setting, patients who have undergone R0 resections will receive tremelimiumab 300 mg ×1 and durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks ×6 doses starting within 12 weeks of surgery.

Radiation will be administered starting ≥14 days after the first durvalumab treatment; it will commence on a Monday or Tuesday and continue weekly from Monday through Friday (except for public holidays).
