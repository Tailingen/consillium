Efficacy and Safety of Venetoclax Combined With BEAM Pretreatment in Autologous Transplantation for DLBCL
This single-center, randomized clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Venetoclax combined with BEAM Pretreatment Regimen in ASCT treatment of DLBCL patients.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from an cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Complete remission rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on 2014 Lugano criteria., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|The time of hematopoietic reconstruction, The first day of neutrophils ≥0.5×109/L for 3 consecutive days was the time of successful implantation of granulocytes. Platelet ≥20.0×109/L for 7 consecutive days and the first day after platelet infusion was considered as the successful time of megakaryocytes implantation., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Transplantation-related adverse reactions, Transplantation-related adverse reactions are any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which is related to ASCT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a group of highly heterogeneous aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with different pathogenesis and clinical prognosis. Despite the survival benefits of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy bridging autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 30%-40% of DLBCL patients fail to respond to treatment and relapse or die within a short period of time. A phase I/II trial of Venetoclax combined with BEAM as a pretreatment regimen for ASCT of high-risk and relapsed/refractory lymphoma was presented at the ASH Meeting 2021 (NCT03583424), and it studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given together with BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) before stem cell transplant in treating participants with relapsed or refractorynon-Hodgkin lymphoma. The results confirmed that Venetoclax has a good prospect in ASCT.
