Cancer of the colon is a highly treatable and often curable disease when localized to the bowel. Surgery is the primary form of treatment and results in cure in approximately 50% of patients. However, recurrence following surgery is a major problem and is often the ultimate cause of death.
Incidence and Mortality
Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer.  In 2022, there were an estimated 1.93 million new cases of colorectal cancer and 903,859 deaths.[
1
]
Estimated new cases and deaths from colon and rectal cancer in the United States in 2025:[
2
]
New cases of colon cancer: 107,320.
New cases of rectal cancer: 46,950.
Deaths: 52,900 (colon and rectal cancers combined).
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors can occur in the colon.  For more information, see

Risk Factors
Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for colorectal cancer include the following:
Family history of colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative.[
3
]
Personal history of colorectal adenomas, colorectal cancer, or ovarian cancer.[
4
-
6
]
Hereditary conditions, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]).[
7
]
Personal history of long-standing chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn colitis.[
8
]
Excessive alcohol use.[
9
]
Cigarette smoking.[
10
]
Race and ethnicity: African American.[
11
,
12
]
Obesity.[
13
]
Screening
Screening for colon cancer should be a part of routine care for all adults aged 50 years and older, especially for those with first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer. This recommendation is based on the frequency of the disease, ability to identify high-risk groups, slow growth of primary lesions, better survival of patients with early-stage lesions, and relative simplicity and accuracy of screening tests. For more information, see
Colorectal Cancer Screening
.
Prognostic Factors
The prognosis of patients with colon cancer is clearly related to:
The degree of penetration of the tumor through the bowel wall.
The presence or absence of nodal involvement.
The presence or absence of distant metastases.
These three characteristics form the basis for all staging systems developed for this disease.
Other prognostic factors for colon cancer include:
Bowel obstruction and bowel perforation are indicators of poor prognosis.[
14
]
Elevated pretreatment serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) have a negative prognostic significance.[
15
]
Many other prognostic markers have been evaluated retrospectively for patients with colon cancer, though most, including allelic loss of chromosome 18q or thymidylate synthase expression, have not been prospectively validated.[
16
-
25
] Microsatellite instability, also associated with HNPCC, has been associated with improved survival independent of tumor stage in a population-based series of 607 patients younger than 50 years with colorectal cancer.[
26
] Patients with HNPCC reportedly have better prognoses in stage-stratified survival analysis than patients with sporadic colorectal cancer, but the retrospective nature of the studies and possibility of selection factors make this observation difficult to interpret.[
27
]
Treatment decisions depend on factors such as physician and patient preferences and the stage of the disease, rather than the age of the patient.[
28
-
30
]
Racial differences in overall survival (OS) after adjuvant therapy have been observed, without differences in disease-free survival, suggesting that comorbid conditions play a role in survival outcome in different patient populations.[
31
]
Follow-Up and Survivorship
Limited data and no high-level evidence are available to guide patients and physicians about surveillance and management of patients after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy.   The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend specific surveillance and follow-up strategies.[
32
,
33
]
Following treatment of colon cancer, periodic evaluations may lead to the earlier identification and management of recurrent disease.[
34
-
37
] This monitoring has limited effect on overall mortality, as few localized, potentially curable metastases are found in patients with recurrent colon cancer. To date, no large-scale randomized trials have documented an OS benefit for standard, postoperative monitoring programs.[
38
-
42
]
CEA is a serum glycoprotein frequently used in the management of patients with colon cancer. A review of the use of this tumor marker suggests:[
43
]
A CEA level is not a valuable screening test for colorectal cancer because of the large number of false-positive and false-negative reports.
Postoperative CEA testing should be restricted to patients who would be candidates for resection of liver or lung metastases.
Routine use of CEA levels alone for monitoring response to treatment is not recommended.
The optimal regimen and frequency of follow-up examinations are not well defined because the impact on patient survival is not clear and the quality of data is poor.[
40

Factors Associated With Recurrence
Diet and exercise
Although cohort studies have suggested that a diet or exercise regimen may improve outcomes, no prospective randomized trials have confirmed these findings. The cohort studies contained multiple opportunities for unintended bias, and caution is needed when using the data from them.
Two prospective observational studies were performed with patients enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
CALGB-89803
trial (NCT00003835), an adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with stage III colon cancer.[
44
,
45
]  In this trial, patients in the lowest quintile of the Western dietary pattern, compared with those patients in the highest quintile, experienced an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival of 3.25 (95% confidence interval [CI],   2.04–5.19;
P
< .001) and an OS of 2.32 (95% CI, 1.36–3.96;
P
< .001). Additionally, stage III colon cancer patients in the highest quintile of dietary glycemic load experienced an adjusted HR for OS of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.22–2.54;
P
< .001), compared with those in the lowest quintile.  Subsequently, in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, among 2,315 participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer, the degree of red and processed meat intake before diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of death (relative risk [RR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05–1.59;
P
= .03), but red meat consumption after diagnosis was not associated with overall mortality.[
46
][
Level of evidence C1
]
A meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies evaluating physical activity before and after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer demonstrated that patients who participated in any amount of physical activity before diagnosis had an RR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65–0.87;
P
< .001) for colorectal cancer-specific mortality, compared with patients who did not participate in any physical activity.[
47
] Patients who participated in a  high amount of physical activity (vs. a low amount) before diagnosis had an RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56–0.87;
P
= .002). Patients who participated in any physical activity (compared with no activity) after diagnosis had an RR of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58–0.95;
P
= .02) for colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Those who participated in a high amount of physical activity (vs. a  low amount) after diagnosis   had an RR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.47–0.92;
P
= .01).[
47

Aspirin
A prospective cohort study examined the use of aspirin after a colorectal cancer diagnosis.[
48
]  Regular users of aspirin after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer experienced an HR
colon cancer–specific mortality
of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53–0.95) and an HR
overall mortality
of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65–0.97).[
48
][
Level of evidence C1
]  One study evaluated 964 patients with rectal or colon cancer from the Nurse’s Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.[
49
] Among patients with colorectal cancer and
PI3K

death from any cause
of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.31–0.94;
P
= .01)[

Cellular Classification of Colon Cancer
Histological types of colon cancer include:
Adenocarcinoma (most colon cancers).
Mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma.
Signet ring adenocarcinoma.
Scirrhous tumors.
Neuroendocrine.[
1
] Tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation typically have a poorer prognosis than pure adenocarcinoma variants.

Stage Information for Colon Cancer
In This Section
AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
Treatment decisions can be made with reference to the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification [
1
] rather than to the older Dukes or the Modified Astler-Coller classification schema.
The AJCC and a National Cancer Institute–sponsored panel recommended that at least 12 lymph nodes be examined in patients with colon and rectal cancer to confirm the absence of nodal involvement by tumor.[
1
-
3
] This recommendation takes into consideration that the number of lymph nodes examined is a reflection of the aggressiveness of lymphovascular mesenteric dissection at the time of surgical resection and the pathological identification of nodes in the specimen. Retrospective studies demonstrated that the number of lymph nodes examined in colon and rectal surgery may be associated with patient outcome.[

AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The AJCC has designated staging by TNM classification to define colon cancer.[

Direct invasion in T4 includes invasion of other organs or other segments of the colorectum as a result of direct extension through the serosa, as confirmed on microscopic examination (e.g., invasion of the sigmoid colon by a carcinoma of the cecum) or, for cancers in a retroperitoneal or subperitoneal location, direct invasion of other organs or structures by virtue of extension beyond the muscularis propria (i.e., respectively, a tumor on the posterior wall of the descending colon invading the left kidney or lateral abdominal wall; or a mid or distal rectal cancer with invasion of prostate, seminal vesicles, cervix, or vagina).

Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, grossly, is classified cT4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be pT1-4a depending on the anatomical depth of wall invasion. The V and L classification should be used to identify the presence or absence of vascular or lymphatic invasion whereas the PN prognostic factor should be used for perineural invasion.

Primary Surgical Therapy
Standard treatment for patients with colon cancer has been open surgical resection of the primary and regional lymph nodes for localized disease.
The role of laparoscopic techniques [

] in the treatment of colon cancer has been examined in two studies.
Evidence (laparoscopic techniques):
A multicenter, prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial (
NCCTG-934653
[NCT00002575]) compared laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) with open colectomy in 872 patients.
At a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 3-year recurrence rates (16% LAC vs. 18% open colectomy; hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63–1.17;
P
= .32) and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates (86% LAC vs. 85% open colectomy; HR
death
in LAC, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.68–1.21;
P
= .51) were similar in both groups for all stages of disease evaluated. Tumor recurrence in surgical incisions was less than 1% for both groups.[
5
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Decreased hospital stay (5 days LAC vs. 6 days open colectomy,
P
< .001) and decreased use of analgesics were reported in the LAC group. A 21% conversion rate from LAC to open procedure was shown.
This study excluded patients with locally advanced disease, transverse colon and rectal tumor locations, and perforated lesions. Each of the 66 surgeons participating in the trial had performed at least 20 LACs and were accredited for study participation after independent videotape review assured appropriate oncologic and surgical principles were maintained.[
5
] The quality-of-life component of this trial was published separately and minimal short-term quality-of-life benefits with LAC were reported.[

][
Level of evidence A3
]
One small, single-institution randomized study of 219 patients showed that the LAC procedure was independently associated with reduced tumor recurrence on multivariate analysis.[
7
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Surgery is curative in 25% to 40% of highly selected patients who develop resectable metastases in the liver and lung. Improved surgical techniques and advances in preoperative imaging have allowed for better patient selection for resection.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy
The potential value of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer is controversial. Pooled analyses and meta-analyses have suggested a 2% to 4% improvement in OS for patients treated with adjuvant fluorouracil (5-FU)–based therapy compared with observation.[

Treatment of Stage II Colon Cancer
section.
Before 2000, 5-FU was the only useful cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage III colon cancer. Since 2000, capecitabine has been established as an equivalent alternative to 5-FU and leucovorin (5-FU/LV). The addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU/LV has been shown to improve OS compared with 5-FU/LV alone. For more information, see the
Treatment of Stage III Colon Cancer
section.

Capecitabine and fluorouracil dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
11
,
12
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
11
-
13
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
14
-
16
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
17
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[
18
]
Adjuvant Radiation Therapy
While combined modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy has a significant role in the management of patients with rectal cancer (below the peritoneal reflection), the role of adjuvant radiation therapy for patients with colon cancer (above the peritoneal reflection) is not well defined. Patterns-of-care analyses and single-institution retrospective reviews suggest a role for radiation therapy in certain high-risk subsets of colon cancer patients (e.g., T4, tumor location in immobile sites, local perforation, obstruction, and residual disease postresection).[
19
-
24
]
Evidence (adjuvant radiation therapy):
A phase III, randomized, intergroup study evaluated the benefit of adding radiation therapy to surgery and chemotherapy with 5-FU-levamisole in selected patients with high-risk colon cancer (e.g., T4; or T3, N1–N2 ascending and/or descending colon).[
25
]
This clinical trial closed early secondary to inadequate patient accrual. An analysis of 222 enrolled patients (the original goal was 700 patients) demonstrated no relapse or OS benefit for the group that received radiation therapy, although the sample size and statistical power were inadequate to exclude benefit.
Adjuvant radiation therapy has no current standard role in the management of patients with colon cancer following curative resection, although it may have a role for patients with residual disease.

Adjuvant chemotherapy
The potential value of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer remains controversial. Although subgroups of patients with stage II colon cancer may be at higher-than-average risk for recurrence (including those with anatomical features such as tumor adherence to adjacent structures, perforation, and complete obstruction),[
5
-
7
] evidence is inconsistent that adjuvant fluorouracil (5-FU)–based chemotherapy is associated with an improved OS compared with surgery alone.[
8
]
Features in patients with stage II colon cancer that are associated with an increased risk of recurrence include:
Inadequate lymph node sampling.
T4 disease.
Involvement of the visceral peritoneum.
A poorly differentiated histology.
The decision to use adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer is complicated and requires thoughtful consideration by both patients and their physicians. Adjuvant therapy is not indicated for most patients unless they are entered into a clinical trial.
Evidence (adjuvant chemotherapy):
The
GRECCR-03
(NCT00046995) and
NCRI-QUASAR1
(NCT00005586) trials evaluated the use of systemic or regional chemotherapy or biological therapy. Following surgery, patients can be considered for entry into a carefully controlled clinical trial.
Investigators from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  have indicated that the reduction in risk of recurrence by adjuvant therapy in patients with stage II disease is of similar magnitude to the benefit seen in patients with stage III disease treated with adjuvant therapy, though an OS advantage has not been established.[
9
]
A meta-analysis of 1,000 stage II patients whose experience was amalgamated from a series of trials indicates a 2% advantage in disease-free survival at 5 years when adjuvant therapy–treated patients treated with 5-FU/leucovorin are compared with untreated controls.[

The Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guideline Initiative Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group undertook a meta-analysis of the English language–published literature consisting of randomized trials in which adjuvant chemotherapy was compared with observation for patients with stage II colon cancer.
The mortality risk ratio was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.01;
P
= .07).[
12

Based on these data, the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued a guideline stating “direct evidence from randomized controlled trials does not support the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer.”[

Surgery
Adjuvant chemotherapy
Current Clinical Trials
Stage III colon cancer denotes lymph node involvement. Studies have indicated that the number of lymph nodes involved affects prognosis; patients with one to three involved nodes have a significantly better survival than those with four or more involved nodes.
Treatment Options for Stage III Colon Cancer
Treatment options for
stage III colon cancer
include:
Surgery
.
Adjuvant chemotherapy
.
Clinical trials. Eligible patients can consider enrollment in carefully controlled clinical trials comparing various postoperative chemotherapy regimens.[
1
]
Surgery
Surgery for stage III colon cancer is wide surgical resection and anastomosis.
Evidence (laparoscopic techniques):
The role of laparoscopic techniques [
2
-
5
] in the treatment of colon cancer was examined in a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial (
NCCTG-934653
[NCT00002575]) comparing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) with open colectomy.
Three-year recurrence rates and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were similar in the two groups. For more information, see the
Primary Surgical Therapy
section.
The quality-of-life component of this trial has been published and minimal short-term quality-of-life benefits with LAC were reported.[

Adjuvant chemotherapy
Chemotherapy regimens before 2000
Before 2000, fluorouracil (5-FU) was the only useful cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage III colon cancer. Many of the early randomized studies of 5-FU in the adjuvant setting failed to show a significant improvement in survival for patients.[
7
-
10
] These trials employed 5-FU alone or 5-FU/semustine.
Evidence (5-FU alone and 5-FU/semustine):
The North Central Cancer Treatment Group  conducted a randomized trial comparing surgical resection alone with postoperative levamisole or levamisole/5-FU.[
11
][
Level of evidence A1
]
A significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) was observed for patients with stage III colon cancer who received levamisole/5-FU, but OS benefits were of borderline statistical significance.
An absolute survival benefit of approximately 12% (49% vs. 37%) was seen in patients with stage III disease treated with levamisole/5-FU.
In a large confirmatory intergroup trial, levamisole/5-FU- prolonged DFS and OS in patients with stage III colon cancer compared with patients who received no treatment after surgery.[
12
][
Level of evidence A1
] Levamisole alone did not confer these benefits.
Subsequent studies tested the combination of 5-FU/leucovorin  (5-FU/LV) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected carcinoma of the colon.
Results of multiple randomized trials that have enrolled more than 4,000 patients comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU/LV  to surgery or 5-FU/semustine/vincristine demonstrate a relative reduction in mortality of between 22% and 33% (3-year OS of 71%–78% increased to 75%–84%).[
13
-
15
]
The completed Intergroup trial 0089 (
INT-0089
[NCT00201331])  randomly assigned 3,794 patients with high-risk stage II or stage III colon cancer to one of the following four treatment arms:[
16
]
The Mayo Clinic regimen administered for a total of six cycles.
The Roswell Park regimen administered for a total of four cycles.
The Mayo Clinic regimen administered with levamisole for six cycles.
The levamisole regimen administered for a total of 1 year.
Results:
Five-year OS ranged from 49% for the Mayo Clinic regimen with levamisole to 60% for the Mayo Clinic regimen, and there were no statistically significant differences among treatment arms.[
16
][
Level of evidence A1
]
A preliminary report in November 1997 demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for OS for the Mayo Clinic regimen with levamisole compared with the levamisole regimen. This difference became insignificant with longer follow-up.
Overall, grade 3 or greater toxicity occurred more frequently for the Mayo Clinic regimen and the Mayo Clinic regimen with levamisole. In addition, the Mayo Clinic regimen was significantly more toxic with levamisole than without levamisole.
The death rate for all four regimens ranged from 0.5% to 1%.
Because of its ease of use and its good toxicity profile, the Roswell Park regimen became the preferred adjuvant regimen used in the United States and was often the control arm in subsequent randomized studies.
In addition to INT-0089, multiple studies have refined the use of 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant setting and can be summarized as follows:
Levamisole is unnecessary when using leucovorin.[
16
]
Treatment that includes 6 to 8 months of 5-FU/LV is equivalent to 12 months of therapy.[
17
-
19
]
Treatment that includes 24 weeks of adjuvant 5-FU/LV is equivalent to 36 weeks of therapy.[
20
]
High-dose leucovorin is equivalent to low-dose leucovorin.[
21
]
A meta-analysis of seven trials revealed no significant difference in efficacy or toxicity among patients aged 70 years or younger compared with patients older than 70 years.[
22
]
An infusional de Gramont bolus and infusional 5-FU/LV schedule is safer than a bolus modified Mayo Clinic schedule of 5-FU/LV.[
20
]
Chemotherapy regimens after 2000
Capecitabine
Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine that undergoes a three-step enzymatic conversion to 5-FU with the last step occurring in the tumor cell. For patients with metastatic colon cancer, two studies have demonstrated the equivalence of capecitabine to 5-FU/LV.[
23
,
24
]
For patients with stage III colon cancer, capecitabine provides equivalent outcome to intravenous 5-FU/LV.
Evidence (capecitabine):
A multicenter European study compared capecitabine (1,250 mg/m
2
) administered twice daily for days 1 to 14, then given every 21 days for eight cycles against the Mayo Clinic schedule of 5-FU and low-dose LV for patients with stage III colon cancer.[
25
]
The study demonstrated that DFS at 3 years is equivalent for patients who received capecitabine or 5-FU/LV (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87;
P
< .001).[
25
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Hand-foot syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia were significantly more common for patients receiving capecitabine, but diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, and neutropenia were significantly less common.
Of patients receiving capecitabine, 57% required a dose modification.
For patients with stage III colon cancer in whom treatment with 5-FU/LV is planned, capecitabine is an equivalent alternative.
Oxaliplatin
Oxaliplatin has significant activity when combined with 5-FU/LV in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Evidence (oxaliplatin):
In the 2,246 patients with resected stage II or stage III colon cancer in the completed Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer study (
MOSAIC
[NCT00275210]), the toxic effects and efficacy of FOLFOX-4  (oxaliplatin/LV/5-FU) were compared with the same 5-FU/LV regimen without oxaliplatin administered for 6 months.[
26
] Based on results from the MOSAIC trial, adjuvant FOLFOX-4 demonstrated prolonged OS for patients with stage III colon cancer compared with patients receiving 5-FU/LV without oxaliplatin.[
27
]
The preliminary results of the study with 37 months of follow-up demonstrated a significant improvement in DFS at 3 years (77.8% vs. 72.9%;
P
= .01) in favor of FOLFOX-4. When initially reported, there was no difference in OS.[
27
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Further follow-up at 6 years demonstrated that the OS for all patients (both stage II and stage III) who entered the study was not significantly different (OS,  78.5% vs. 76.0%; HR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71–1.00). On subset analysis, the 6-year OS in patients with stage III colon cancer was 72.9% in the patients receiving FOLFOX-4 and 68.7% in the patients receiving 5-FU/LV (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.97;
P
= .023).[
27
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Patients treated with FOLFOX-4 experienced more frequent toxic effects consisting mainly of neutropenia (41% >grade 3) and reversible peripheral sensorial neuropathy (12.4% >grade 3).
In a randomized phase III study (
NSABP C-07
[NCT00004931]), 2,407 patients with stage II or stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned  to adjuvant 5-FU/LV or fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxaliplatin (FLOX) (weekly 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin administered on weeks 1, 3, and 5 of each 6-week cycle). DFS was the primary end point of the study.[
28
]
DFS was significantly longer in the treatment group who received FLOX, but OS was not significantly different. The DFS rate was 69.4% for patients who received FLOX and 64.2% for patients who received 5-FU/LV (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.93;
P
= .0034).
The OS rate at 5 years was 80.2% for patients who received FLOX and 78.4% for patients who received 5-FU/LV  (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75–1.02;
P
= .08).[
28
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Grade 3 and grade 4 diarrhea was experienced by 36.9% of patients who received FLOX, and grade 3 and grade 4 dehydration was experienced by 16.1% of patients who received FLOX.
Most physicians have adopted FOLFOX as the standard of care because of  toxicity concerns with weekly FLOX.   FOLFOX has become the reference standard for the next generation of clinical trials for patients with stage III colon cancer.[
27
]
Capecitabine and oxaliplatin
The combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) is an accepted standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Evidence (CAPOX):
CAPOX was evaluated in the adjuvant setting for patients with resected stage III colon cancer (capecitabine 1,000 mg/m
2
bid on days 1 to 14 every 21 days and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m
2
every 21 days for a total of 8 cycles).[
29
] A randomized phase III trial (
NO16968
[NCT00069121]), randomly assigned 1,886 patients with stage III colon cancer to receive CAPOX or bolus 5FU-LV (Roswell Park or Mayo Clinic schedule).
The 7-year DFS rates were 63% for patients who received CAPOX and 56% for patients who received bolus 5-FU/LV (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.69–0.93;
P
= .004).
The 7-year OS rates were 73% for patients who received CAPOX and 67% for patients who received a bolus 5-FU/LV (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.99;
P
= .04).[
29
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Based on this trial, CAPOX has become an acceptable standard regimen for patients with stage III colon cancer.
Oxaliplatin length of therapy
Given the high rate of disabling neuropathy, the duration of oxaliplatin adjuvant therapy became an open question.
Evidence (length of therapy for oxaliplatin):
The International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Therapy (IDEA) collaboration consisted of six separate randomized trials with regimens of 6 months versus 3 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.  The IDEA study was a prospective, preplanned pooled analysis of these concurrently conducted studies to evaluate the noninferiority of adjuvant therapy of either FOLFOX or CAPOX administered for 3 months versus 6 months. Noninferiority could be claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the HR did not exceed 1.12.[
30
]
From 2007 through 2015, 13,025 patients with stage III colon cancer were enrolled in six concurrent phase III trials. Of these patients, 12,834 patients met the criteria for intention-to-treat analysis. At a median follow-up of 41.8 months, noninferiority of 3 months versus 6 months was not confirmed in the modified intention-to-treat population (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00–1.15,
P
= .11 for noninferiority of 3 months).
The 3-year DFS rates were 74.6% in the 3-month group and 75.5% in the 6-month group.
Neurotoxicity of grade 2 or higher was lower in the 3-month group (16.6% for patients who received FOLFOX and 14.2% for patients who received CAPOX) than in the 6-month group (47.7% for patients who received FOLFOX and 44.9% for patients who received CAPOX). Moreover, all other toxicities were substantially lower with 3 months of treatment than with 6 months.
A subgroup analyses observed:
Among patients receiving FOLFOX, 6 months of therapy was superior to 3 months of therapy (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.26;
P
= .001)
Among patients receiving CAPOX, 3 months of therapy was like 6 months of therapy (HR
DFS
, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85–1.06) and met the prespecified margin for noninferiority.
Among patients with N1 tumors (<4 positive nodes), the HR was 1.07 (0.97–1.17), and among those patients with N2 tumors (≥4 positive nodes), the HR was 1.07 (0.96–1.19).
Among patients with T4 tumors, a therapy duration of 3 months was inferior to a duration of 6 months (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03–1.31).
Among patients with low-risk tumors (T1–3, N1), 3 months of therapy was noninferior to 6 months of therapy (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90–1.12) with a 3-year DFS rate of 83.1% for patients who received 3 months of therapy and 83.3% for patients who received 6 months of therapy.
Among patients with high-risk tumors (T4 or N2), 6 months of therapy was superior to 3 months of therapy (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03–1.23;
P
= .01).
The IDEA study has generated much debate regarding the optimal length of therapy. It is recommended that patients and doctors weigh the pros and cons of potential diminished efficacy of 3 months of therapy versus the definite increased risk of toxicity, particularly neuropathy. CAPOX appears to be slightly more active than FOLFOX in the adjuvant setting.

Current Clinical Trials
Stage IV colon cancer denotes distant metastatic disease. Treatment of recurrent colon cancer depends on the sites of recurrent disease demonstrable by physical examination and/or radiographic studies. In addition to standard radiographic procedures, radioimmunoscintography may add clinical information that may affect management.[
1
] Such approaches have not led to improvements in long-term outcome measures such as survival.
Treatment options for
stage IV colon cancer
, recurrent colon cancer, and liver metastases include:
Surgical resection of locally recurrent cancer.
Surgical resection and anastomosis or bypass of obstructing or bleeding primary lesions in selected metastatic cases.
Resection of liver metastases in selected metastatic patients (5-year cure rate for resection of solitary or combination metastases exceeds 20%) or ablation in selected patients.[

Treatment Options for Liver Metastasis
Approximately 50% of colon cancer patients will be diagnosed with hepatic metastases, either at the time of initial presentation or because of disease recurrence. Although only a small proportion of patients with hepatic metastases are candidates for surgical resection, advances in tumor ablation techniques and in both regional and systemic chemotherapy administration provide for several treatment options. These include:
Surgery
.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
.
Local ablation
.
Adjuvant chemotherapy
.
Intra-arterial chemotherapy
.
Surgery
Hepatic metastasis may be considered to be resectable based on the following factors:[
5
,
7
,
13
-
16
]
Limited number of lesions.
Intrahepatic locations of lesions.
Lack of major vascular involvement.
Absent or limited extrahepatic disease.
Enough functional hepatic reserve.
For patients with resectable hepatic metastasis, a negative margin resection resulted in 5-year survival rates of 25% to 40% in mostly nonrandomized studies, such as the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial (
NCCTG-934653
[NCT00002575]).[

Level of evidence C3
] Improved surgical techniques and advances in preoperative imaging have improved patient selection for resection.     In addition, multiple studies with multiagent chemotherapy have demonstrated that patients with metastatic disease isolated to the liver, which historically would be considered unresectable, can occasionally be made resectable after the administration of chemotherapy.[
17
]
For patients with unresectable liver metastases, excellent outcomes have been achieved with liver transplant. The optimal patient cohort for this therapy is still being determined, but in general, the goal is to achieve good initial systemic control with chemotherapy, followed by transplant. In one study of 91 patients, 11% underwent live donor liver transplant. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years after transplant, the recurrence-free survival rate was 62% and the overall survival (OS) rate was 100%.[

Patients with hepatic metastases that are deemed unresectable will occasionally become candidates for resection if they have a good response to chemotherapy. These patients have 5-year survival rates similar to patients who initially had resectable disease.[

] There is no consensus on the best regimen to use to convert unresectable isolated liver metastases to resectable liver metastases.
Local ablation
Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a safe technique (2% major morbidity and <1% mortality rate) that may provide for long-term tumor control.[
20
-
26
] Radiofrequency ablation and cryosurgical ablation [
27
-
30
] remain options for patients with tumors that cannot be resected and for patients who are not candidates for liver resection.
Other local ablative techniques that have been used to manage liver metastases include embolization and interstitial radiation therapy.[
31
,
32
] Patients with limited pulmonary metastases, and patients with both pulmonary and hepatic metastases, may also be considered for surgical resection, with 5-year survival possible in highly-selected patients.[

Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable liver metastases
The role of adjuvant chemotherapy after potentially curative resection of liver metastases is uncertain.
Evidence (adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable liver metastases):
In the era before the use of  FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium [LV], fluorouracil [5-FU], and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5-FU/LV/irinotecan), two trials attempted to randomly assign patients after resection of liver metastases to 5-FU/LV or observation, but both studies were closed early because of  poor accrual.
The
FFCD-9902
trial (NCT00304135) randomly assigned 173 patients (200 patients were  planned) to postoperative 5-FU/LV, which is the Mayo Clinic regimen, or observation.[
35
]
The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 33.5% for patients in the chemotherapy group and 26.7% for patients in the control group (Cox multivariate analysis: odds ratio (OR) for recurrence or death, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.96;
P
= .028). The 5-year OS rate was not significantly different between the groups (chemotherapy group, 51.1% vs. the control group, 41.1%; OR
death
, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48–1.10;
P
= .13).
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Institute of Canada/Gruppo Interdisciplinare Valutazione Interventi in Oncologia (EORTC/NCIC/GIVIO) International trial attempted a similar random assignment of patients after surgical resection of liver metastases.  The study closed  because of poor accrual, and a combined analysis of the study and the FFCD-9902 study was done instead.  In the combined analysis, 278 patients (138 of whom received chemotherapy; 14 of whom received surgery alone) were included.[
36
]
The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 27.9 months in the chemotherapy arm and 18.8 months in the surgery alone arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00–1.76;
P
= .058).
The median OS was 62.2 months in the chemotherapy arm compared with 47.3 months in the surgery-alone arm (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.95–1.82;
P
= .095).
In the era of multiagent chemotherapy, two subsequent studies evaluated its role in the adjuvant setting following  resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
A phase III study randomly assigned 306 patients to  5-FU/LV or FOLFIRI after a resection of liver  metastases.[
37
]
There was no difference in DFS (21.6 months for 5-FU/LV vs. 24.7 months for FOLFIRI; HR, 0.89; log-rank
P
=  .44) or OS (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72–1.64).
The
EORTC-40983
trial (NCT00006479) randomly assigned 364 patients with up to four resectable liver metastases to perioperative FOLFOX (six cycles presurgery and six cycles postsurgery) or surgery alone.[
38
]
The PFS rate was 28.1% (95.66% CI, 21.3%–35.5%) for the surgery-alone group and 35.4% (28.1%–42.7%; HR, 0.79;   0.62–1.02;
P
= .058) for the perioperative chemotherapy group. There was no difference in OS.  Subsequent  post hoc analysis demonstrated that the difference in PFS in truly eligible patients rose 8.1% (from 28.1% [21.2%–36.6%] to 36.2% [28.7%–43.8%]; HR, 0.77 [0.60–1.00];
P
= .041).  In patients who  underwent resection of liver metastases, the difference in PFS rose 9.2% (from 33.2% [25.3%–41.2%] to 42.4% [34.0%–50.5%]; HR, 0.73 [0.55–0.97];
P
= .025).
Reversible postoperative complications occurred more often after chemotherapy than after surgery (40 [25%] of the 159 complications vs.  27 [16%] of the 170 complications;
P
= .04). After surgery, there were two deaths in the surgery-alone group and one in the perioperative chemotherapy group.
There is no high-level evidence to demonstrate that perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy improves OS for patients undergoing resection of liver metastases.  Nevertheless, on the basis of  post hoc subset analyses of the EORTC study, some physicians feel perioperative or postoperative therapy is reasonable in this setting.
Intra-arterial chemotherapy after liver resection
Hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with floxuridine for liver metastases has produced higher overall response rates but no consistent improvement in survival when compared with systemic chemotherapy.[
2
,
39
-
43
] A meta-analysis of the randomized studies, which were all done in the era when only fluoropyrimidines were available for systemic therapy, did not demonstrate a survival advantage.[
44
]
Evidence (intra-arterial chemotherapy after liver resection):
Two trials evaluated hepatic arterial floxuridine in the adjuvant setting after liver resection.
A trial of hepatic arterial floxuridine and dexamethasone plus systemic 5-FU/LV compared with systemic 5-FU/LV  alone showed improved 2-year PFS rates (57% vs. 42%,
P
= .07) and OS rates (86% vs. 72%,
P
= .03) for patients in the combined therapy arm but did not show a significant statistical difference in median survival compared with systemic 5-FU therapy alone.[
45
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The median survival in the combined therapy arm was 72.2 months versus 59.3 months in the monotherapy arm (
P
= .21).
A second trial preoperatively randomly assigned 109 patients who had one to three potentially resectable colorectal hepatic metastases to either no further therapy or postoperative hepatic arterial floxuridine plus systemic 5-FU.[
46
] Of those randomly assigned patients, 27% were deemed ineligible at the time of surgery, which left only 75 patients evaluable for recurrence and survival.
While liver cancer recurrence was decreased, median or 4-year survival was not significantly different between the patient groups.
Further studies are required to evaluate this treatment approach and to determine whether more effective systemic combination chemotherapy alone may provide similar results compared with hepatic intra-arterial therapy plus systemic treatment.
Several studies show increased local toxic effects with hepatic infusional therapy, including liver function abnormalities and fatal biliary sclerosis.

5-FU
When 5-FU was the only active chemotherapy drug, trials in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic disease demonstrated partial responses and prolongation of the time-to-progression (TTP) of disease,[
47
,
48
]  and improved survival and quality of life for patients who received  chemotherapy versus best supportive care.[
49

51
] Several trials have analyzed the activity and toxic effects of various 5-FU/LV regimens using different doses and administration schedules and showed essentially equivalent results with a median survival time in the 12-month range.[

Evidence (irinotecan):
An intergroup study (
NCCTG-N9741
[NCT00003594]) compared  irinotecan/5-FU/LV (IFL) with oxaliplatin/LV/5-FU (FOLFOX-4) in first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Patients assigned to FOLFOX-4 experienced an improved PFS (median, 6.9 months vs. 8.7 months;
P
= .014; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89) and OS (15.0 months vs. 19.5 months,
P
= .001; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54–0.82) compared with patients randomly assigned to IFL.
Subsequently, two studies compared FOLFOX with FOLFIRI, and patients were allowed to cross over upon progression on first-line therapy, respectively.[

PFS and OS were identical between the treatment arms in both studies.
The Bolus, Infusional, or Capecitabine with Camptosar-Celecoxib (
BICC-C
[NCT00094965]) trial evaluated several different irinotecan-based regimens in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, including FOLFIRI, irinotecan plus bolus 5-FU/LV (mIFL), and capecitabine/irinotecan (CAPIRI).[
60

The study randomly assigned 430 patients and was closed early because of poor accrual.
The patients who received FOLFIRI had a better PFS than the patients who received either mIFL (7.6 months vs. 5.9 months,
P
= .004) or CAPIRI (7.6 months vs. 5.8 months,
P
= .015).
Patients who received CAPIRI had the highest grade 3 or higher rates of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and hand-foot syndrome.
Since the publication of these studies, the use of either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI is considered acceptable for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
When using an irinotecan-based regimen as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, FOLFIRI is preferred.[

Oxaliplatin
Randomized phase III trials have addressed the equivalence of substituting capecitabine for infusional 5-FU. Two phase III studies have evaluated 5-FU/oxaliplatin (FUOX) versus capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX).[
61
,
62
]
Evidence (oxaliplatin):
The AIO Colorectal Study Group randomly assigned 474 patients to either 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin (FUFOX) or CAPOX.
The median PFS was 7.1 months for the CAPOX arm and 8.0 months for the FUFOX arm (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.96–1.43;
P

The Spanish Grupo de Tratamiento de los Tumores Digestivos randomly assigned 348 patients to CAPOX or FUOX.[

The TTP was 8.9 months versus 9.5 months (
P

When using an oxaliplatin-based regimen as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, a CAPOX regimen is not inferior to a FUOX regimen.
Before the availability of cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, and ziv-aflibercept as second-line therapy, second-line chemotherapy with irinotecan in patients treated with 5-FU/LV as first-line therapy demonstrated improved OS when compared with either infusional 5-FU or supportive care.[

]
Similarly, a phase III trial randomly assigned patients who progressed on irinotecan and 5-FU/LV to bolus and infusional 5-FU/LV (LV5FU2), single-agent oxaliplatin, or FOLFOX-4. The median TTP for FOLFOX-4 versus LV5FU2 was 4.6 months versus 2.7 months (stratified log-rank test, 2-sided

Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is a partially humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF. Bevacizumab can reasonably be added to either FOLFIRI or FOLFOX for patients undergoing first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
Evidence (bevacizumab):
After bevacizumab was approved, the
BICC-C
trial was amended, and an additional 117 patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI/bevacizumab or mIFL/bevacizumab.
Although the primary end point of PFS was not significantly different, patients who received FOLFIRI/bevacizumab had a significantly better OS (not yet reached with a median follow-up of 22.6 months vs. 19.2 months,
P

Despite the lack of direct data, in standard practice, bevacizumab was added to FOLFOX as a standard first-line regimen based on the results of the
NCCTG-N9741
trial.[
69
] Subsequently, in a randomized phase III study, patients with untreated, stage IV, colorectal cancer were randomly assigned in a 2 × 2 factorial design to CAPOX versus FOLFOX-4, then to bevacizumab versus placebo. PFS was the primary end point.
In this trial, 1,401 patients were randomly assigned, and the median PFS was 9.4 months for patients who received bevacizumab and 8.0 months for the patients who received placebo (HR, 0.83; 97.5% CI, 0.72–0.95;

The median PFS (intention-to-treat analysis) was 8.0 months in the pooled CAPOX-containing arms versus 8.5 months in the FOLFOX-4-containing arms (HR, 1.04; 97.5% CI, 0.93–1.16), with the upper limit of the 97.5% CI being below the predefined noninferiority margin of 1.23.[

Based on these studies, bevacizumab can reasonably be added to either FOLFIRI or FOLFOX for patients undergoing first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. A major question was whether the use of bevacizumab after first-line therapy was warranted when bevacizumab was used as a component of first-line therapy. At the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, data were  presented from a randomized, controlled trial.[
73
] In the trial, 820 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, after progressing on first-line chemotherapy that included bevacizumab,  were randomly assigned to chemotherapy without bevacizumab or chemotherapy with bevacizumab.   Patients who received bevacizumab experienced an improved OS compared with the patients who did not receive bevacizumab. The median OS was 11.2 months for patients who received bevacizumab/chemotherapy and 9.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy without bevacizumab (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.94; unstratified log-rank test,

Patients who received FOLFOXIRI had significantly more grade 3 and 4 toxicities, including neutropenia, stomatitis, and peripheral neuropathy.
Cetuximab
Cetuximab is a partially humanized monoclonal antibody against EGFR.  Because cetuximab affects tyrosine kinase signaling at the surface of the cell membrane, tumors with activating variants of the pathway downstream of the EGFR, such as
KRAS
variants, are not sensitive to its effects.  The addition of cetuximab to multiagent chemotherapy improves survival in patients with colon cancers that lack a
KRAS
variant (i.e.,
KRAS
wild type). Importantly, patients with
KRAS
-altered tumors may experience worse outcome when cetuximab is added to multiagent chemotherapy regimens containing bevacizumab.

Retrospective studies of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have suggested that responses to anti-EGFR antibody therapy are confined to patients with tumors that harbor wild types of
KRAS
(i.e., lack activating variants at codon 12 or 13 of the
KRAS
gene).
A subset analysis evaluating efficacy in relation to
KRAS
status was done in patients enrolled in the Crystal Study. There was a significant interaction for
KRAS
variant status and treatment for tumor response (

The reasons for lack of benefit in adding cetuximab are unclear. Subset analyses suggest that the use of capecitabine was associated with an inferior outcome, and the use of second-line therapy was less frequent in patients treated with cetuximab.
There was no difference between the continuously treated patients (arm A) and the intermittently treated patients (arm C).  Median survival in the intent-to-treat population (n = 815 in both groups) was 15.8 months (IQR, 9.4–26.1) in arm A and 14.4 months (IQR, 8.0–24.7) in arm C (HR, 1.084; 80% CI, 1.008–1.165). In the per-protocol population, which included only those patients who were free from progression at 12 weeks and randomly assigned to continue treatment or go on a chemotherapy holiday (arm A, n = 467; arm C, n = 511), median survival was 19.6 months (IQR, 13.0–28.1) in arm A and 18.0 months (IQR, 12.1–29.3) in arm C (HR, 1.087;  95% CI, 0.986–1.198).
The upper limits of CIs for HRs in both analyses were greater than the predefined noninferiority boundary.  While intermittent chemotherapy was not deemed noninferior, there appeared to be clinically insignificant differences in patient outcomes.

Patients who received panitumumab experienced an improved PFS (8 weeks vs. 7.3 weeks; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.66;

There was no difference in OS, which was thought to be the result of 76% of patients on best supportive care crossing over to panitumumab.
In the Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for 
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy (
PRIME
)  study [NCT00364013], 1,183 patients were randomly assigned to FOLFOX-4 with or without panitumumab as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. The study was amended to enlarge the sample size to address patients with the
KRAS
wild-type tumors and patients with
KRAS

For patients with
KRAS
wild-type tumors, a statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in those who received panitumumab/FOLFOX-4 compared with those who received only FOLFOX-4 (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.97; stratified log-rank
P

The median PFS was 9.6 months (95% CI, 9.2–11.1) for patients who received panitumumab/FOLFOX-4 and 8.0 months (95% CI, 7.5–9.3) for patients who received FOLFOX-4. OS was not significantly different between the groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.02;
P

For patients with
KRAS
-altered tumors, there was worse PFS with the addition of panitumumab (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04–1.62; stratified log-rank
P

Of the 620 patients who were initially identified as not having a variant in exon 2 of
KRAS

Similarly, the addition of panitumumab to a regimen of FOLFOX/bevacizumab resulted in a worse PFS and worse toxicity compared with a regimen of FOLFOX/bevacizumab alone in patients not selected for

Anti-EGFR antibody versus anti-VEGF antibody with first-line chemotherapy
In the management of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer, it is unknown whether patients with
KRAS
wild-type cancer should receive an anti-EGFR antibody with chemotherapy or an anti-VEGF antibody with chemotherapy.  Two studies attempted to answer this question.[

Evidence (anti-EGFR antibody vs. anti-VEGF antibody with first-line chemotherapy)
The
FIRE-3
study (NCT00433927)  randomly assigned 592 patients with
KRAS
exon 2 wild-type tumors who were previously untreated to FOLFIRI/cetuximab (297 patients) or FOLFIRI/bevacizumab (295 patients). The primary end point of the study was objective response rate.[

The objective response rate was not significantly different between the groups (objective response rate, 62.0%; 95% CI, 56.2%–67.5% vs. objective response rate, 58.0%; 95% CI, 52.1%–63.7%;  OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.85–1.64;
P

The median PFS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.8–10.8) in the cetuximab group and 10.3 months (95% CI, 9.8–11.3) in the bevacizumab group (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.88–1.26;
P

The median OS was 28.7 months (95% CI, 24.0–36.6) in the cetuximab group compared with 25.0 months (22.7–27.6) in the bevacizumab group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.96;
P

In a post hoc analysis of patients with expanded
RAS
wild-type tumors (sequencing for mutational hot spots within
KRAS
and
NRAS
genes, including exon 2 codons 12 and 13; exon 3 codons 59 and 61; and exon 4 codons 117 and 146), the median OS was 33.1 months (95% CI, 24.5–39.4) in the cetuximab group compared with 25.0 months (95% CI, 23.0–28.1) in the bevacizumab group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54–0.90;

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B
Intergroup study 80405
(NCT00265850) was presented at the ASCO meeting in 2014. This study randomly assigned  2,334 previously untreated patients with
KRAS
wild-type cancer to chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab or chemotherapy/cetuximab.  OS was the primary end point.[

There was no statistically significant difference in OS among the patients assigned to bevacizumab or cetuximab (for OS differences, chemotherapy/bevacizumab =  29.04 [25.66–31.21] months vs. chemotherapy/cetuximab =   29.93 [27.56–31.21] months; HR, 0.92 [0.78–1.09];
P

Based on  these two studies, no apparent significant difference is evident about  starting treatment with chemotherapy/bevacizumab or chemotherapy/cetuximab in patients with
KRAS
wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. However, in patients with
KRAS
wild-type cancer, administration of an anti-EGFR antibody during management improves OS.
Trifluridine-tipiracil
Trifluridine-tipiracil (
Lonsurf
; also called TAS-102) is an orally administered combination of a thymidine-based nucleic acid analogue, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride. Trifluridine, in its triphosphate form, inhibits thymidylate synthase; therefore,  trifluridine, in this form, has an antitumor effect.  Tipiracil hydrochloride is a potent inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase, which actively degrades trifluridine.  The combination of trifluridine and tipiracil allows for adequate plasma levels of trifluridine.
Evidence (trifluridine-tipiracil):
A phase III, double-blind study (
RECOURSE
[NCT01607957])  randomly assigned 800 stage IV colorectal cancer patients whose cancer had been  refractory to two previous therapies.  Patients were required to have received 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab and, if the patients had
KRAS
wild-type cancer, cetuximab or panitumumab.  Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive best supportive care plus trifluridine-tipiracil (n = 534) or placebo (n = 266). The median age of patients was 63 years, and most patients (60%–63%) received four or more previous lines of therapy. All patients had formerly received fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, and 52% of them had received an EGFR inhibitor. Approximately 20% of the patients had received previous treatment with regorafenib.[

Trifluridine-tipiracil was administered at 35 mg/m
2
twice daily with meals for 5 days, with 2 days of rest for 2 weeks, followed by a 14-day rest period.
The primary end point of the study was OS. The median OS for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received trifluridine-tipiracil was 7.1 months compared with 5.3 months for those who received a placebo (HR, 0.68;
P
< .0001).
The median PFS time in the trifluridine-tipiracil arm was 2 months versus 1.7 months with a placebo (HR, 0.48;
P
< .0001).
Secondary end points focused on PFS, overall response rate, and disease control rate.
The overall response rate was 1.6% with trifluridine-tipiracil, which consisted of a complete response in one patient and partial responses in other patients. The overall response rate with a  placebo was 0.4% (
P
= .29).
The FDA approved trifluridine-tipiracil for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, based on the results of the RECOURSE trial.
Evidence (combination of trifluridine-tipiracil and bevacizumab):
A phase III, international, multi-institutional trial (
SUNLIGHT
[NCT04737187]) included 492 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer whose cancer was refractory to up to two prior chemotherapy regimens. Patients were required to have received 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, or an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (for patients with
RAS
wild-type disease). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either trifluridine-tipiracil monotherapy (n = 246) or trifluridine-tipiracil combined with bevacizumab (n = 246). The median patient age was 62 years for the combination arm, and 64 years for the monotherapy arm and most patients (93% and 91%) had received two prior lines of therapy. Over 98% of patients in both arms had received 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, and over 93% of patients with
RAS
wild-type variants in both arms had received anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy. The median follow-up was 14.2 months. Trifluridine-tipiracil was given at 35 mg/m
2
twice daily on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12 of a 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab was given on days 1 and 15 of each cycle at 5 mg/kg. The primary end point of the study was OS.[
93
]
The median OS was 10.8 months for patients who received trifluridine-tipiracil and bevacizumab and 7.5 months for patients who received trifluridine-tipiracil monotherapy (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49–0.77;
P

OS was significant across subgroups, including patients with
RAS
variants and wild-type variants, patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and microsatellite stability (MSS) cancers, and both for patients previously treated with bevacizumab and bevacizumab-naïve patients.
The median PFS was 5.6 months in the combination arm and 2.4 months in the trifluridine-tipiracil monotherapy arm (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36–0.54;
P
< .001).
Secondary end points focused on PFS, overall response rate, and safety.
The overall response rate was 6.1% for the combination arm and 1.2% for the monotherapy arm.
Adverse events leading to therapy discontinuation were observed in 12.6% of patients in both arms. Dose reductions occurred in 16.3% of patients in the combination group and 12.2% of patients in the trifluridine-tipiracil monotherapy group. The most common adverse event was neutropenia, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia observed in 43% of patients in the combination arm and 32% of patients in the monotherapy arm.
The FDA approved the combination of trifluridine-tipiracil and bevacizumab for the treatment of patients  with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer based on the results of the SUNLIGHT trial.
Regorafenib
Regorafenib is an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase pathways, including VEGF.  In 2012, the FDA approved regorafenib for patients who had progressed on previous therapy.
Evidence (regorafenib):
The safety and effectiveness of regorafenib were evaluated in a single, clinical study of 760 patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive regorafenib or a placebo in addition to the best supportive care.[
94
,

]
Patients treated with regorafenib had a statistically significant improvement in OS (6.4 months in the regorafenib group vs. 5.0 months in the placebo group;  HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94; one-sided
P
= .0052).
With the improved OS from the combination of trifluridine-tipiracil and bevacizumab discussed above, regorafenib is now often considered a fourth-line or later option for treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Fruquintinib
Fruquintinib is an inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2 and 3. In 2023, the FDA approved fruquintinib for adults with metastatic colorectal cancer who had previously received fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF therapy. If patients had
RAS
wild-type disease and were medically appropriate, an anti-EGFR therapy was also required.
Evidence (fruquintinib):
The phase III, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled
FRESCO-2
trial (NCT04322539) included 691 patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma who had received all standard approved cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Patients had disease progression during, or were intolerant of, trifluridine-tipiracil, regorafenib, or both. Patients had received a median of four lines of prior systemic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to receive one of the following regimens:
Fruquintinib (5 mg orally once daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle).
Placebo (orally once daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle).
All patients received best supportive care. 
                A total of 461 patients received fruquintinib, and 230 received placebo. The primary end point was OS.[
96
] The results were as follows:
The median OS was significantly longer in the fruquintinib group (7.4 months; 95% CI, 6.7–8.2) than in the placebo group (4.8 months; 95% CI, 4.0–5.8) (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.80;

The median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI, 3.5–3.8) in the fruquintinib group and 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.8–1.9) in the placebo group (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.21–0.34;
P
< .001).
Subgroup analyses demonstrated the benefit of fruquintinib as opposed to placebo in most subgroups. Notably, this benefit was seen in patients with both
RAS
variants and
RAS
wild-type disease, patients with liver metastases, and patients pretreated with trifluridine-tipiracil with or without regorafenib.
The disease control rate was significantly longer in the fruquintinib group (56%) than in the placebo group (16%), with an adjusted difference of 39% (95% CI, 32.8%–46.0%;
P
< .0001).
Grade 3 or higher adverse events 	occurred in 65% of patients in the fruquintinib group. The most common adverse events were hypertension (14%), asthenia (8%), abnormal hepatic function (8%), dermatologic toxicity (7%), and hand-foot syndrome (6%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 50% of patients in the placebo group. The most common were abnormal hepatic function (9%), infection (6%), and asthenia (4%).
Encorafenib with cetuximab in patients with
BRAF
V600E variants
BRAF
V600E variants occur in about 10% of metastatic colorectal cancers and are an indicator of poor prognosis.  Unlike in melanoma, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy has not shown a benefit in colorectal cancer, and multiple studies have evaluated concurrent targeting of the EGFR-MAPK pathway.
Evidence (encorafenib with cetuximab in patients with
BRAF
V600E variants):
Encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor), binimetinib (MEK inhibitor), and cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor):
In the international, open-label, randomized, phase III
BEACON
trial, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and
BRAF
V600E variants who previously received one or two treatment regimens were enrolled.[
97

Doublet therapy with sotorasib 240 mg once daily plus panitumumab (6 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) (n = 53).
Investigator's choice standard-of-care therapy with trifluridine-tipiracil (35 mg/m

The most common adverse effects with combined sotorasib and panitumumab therapy were skin-related toxicities and hypomagnesemia.
Immunotherapy
Approximately 4% of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer have tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite unstable/MSI-H. The MSI-H phenotype is associated with germline defects in the
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
, and
PMS2
genes and is the primary phenotype observed in tumors from patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome.  Patients can also have the MSI-H phenotype because one of these genes was silenced via DNA methylation. Testing for microsatellite instability can be done with molecular genetic tests, which look for microsatellite instability in the tumor tissue, or  with immunohistochemistry, which looks for the loss of mismatch repair proteins.  MSI-H status has historically been prognostic of increased survival for patients with earlier-stage disease and since 2015, has also been found to predict tumor response to checkpoint inhibition.
The FDA approved pembrolizumab for patients with treatment-naïve, metastatic, dMMR/MSI-H colorectal cancer in 2020. Studies regarding first-line treatment with dual checkpoint inhibitors are ongoing. The FDA  approved the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab in 2017 for patients with microsatellite-unstable tumors who had previously received 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based therapy.  In 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor) to treat MSI-H colorectal cancers that progressed on prior 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based therapies.

Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 56% of patients who received pembrolizumab (with 9% experiencing grade 3 or higher infusion-related adverse events), compared with 78% of patients who received chemotherapy.
A final review of OS, presented in abstract form, showed that median OS was not reached in the pembrolizumab arm and was 36.7 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53–1.03;

Some patients were also randomly assigned to receive nivolumab, but results from these patients were not presented in the abstract. Treatments were continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (all arms), or for up to 2 years (nivolumab-ipilimumab arm). A total of 171 patients who received nivolumab and ipilimumab and 84 patients who received chemotherapy alone were centrally confirmed to have dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer.[

Two grade 5 deaths occurred in the nivolumab-ipilimumab arm. Grade 3 to 4 events occurred in 23% of patients in the nivolumab-ipilimumab arm and 48% of patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm.
Second-line immunotherapy
Pembrolizumab monotherapy
Evidence (pembrolizumab monotherapy):
The FDA approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy was based on data from 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers enrolled across five uncontrolled, multicohort, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Ninety patients had colorectal cancer, and 59 patients were diagnosed with 1 of 14 other cancer types. Patients received either 200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every 2 weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurred. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (assessed by blinded independent central radiologists’ review in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) and response duration.
The objective response rate was 39.6% (95% CI, 31.7%–47.9%).
Responses lasted 6 months or longer for 78% of patients who responded to pembrolizumab. There were 11 complete responses and 48 partial responses.
The objective response rate was similar whether patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (36%) or a different cancer (46% across the 14 other cancer types).
Nivolumab monotherapy
Evidence (nivolumab monotherapy):
In the
CheckMate-142
trial (NCT02060188), 74 patients with previously treated dMMR/MSI-H colorectal cancer were enrolled in an open-label, single-arm, phase II study to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks).  The primary end point was objective response as per RECIST 1.1.[
109
]
The objective response rate was 31.1% (95% CI, 20.8%–42.9%).
Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21% of patients.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab
Evidence (nivolumab and ipilimumab):
CheckMate-142
(NCT02060188) was a multicenter, open-label, phase II trial with a cohort for patients with recurrent or metastatic dMMR and/or MSI-H colorectal cancer who had progressed on, were intolerant of, or declined at least one line of chemotherapy (including 5-FU and oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan).  The trial enrolled 119 patients who received four doses of nivolumab (3 mg/kg) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks (induction), then nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV) every 2 weeks (maintenance).  The primary end point was objective response rate.[
109
]
The objective response rate was  55% (95% CI, 45.2%–63.8%).
Among patients experiencing a response, 83% had responses lasting more than 6 months.
Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32% of patients.

About This PDQ Summary
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of colon cancer. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Colon Cancer Treatment are:
Amit Chowdhry, MD, PhD (University of Rochester Medical Center)
Leon Pappas, MD, PhD (Massachusetts General Hospital)
