Multidisciplinary Prehabilitation Management Pathway and Network Platform Construction
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if "Prehabilitation model for Internet+ devices"improve patients' preoperative status and reduce the postoperative recovery time, postoperative complications，comparing to trditional prehabilitation model. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does the Prehabilitation model for Internet+ devices works out?
2. Does"Prehabilitation model for Internet+ devices" better increase the patient's six-minute walk test distance?

Participants will:

Take Internet+devices model or traditional model to prehabilitation for 2-4weeks.

Test 6MWT before operation.

6 minute walking test distance, 6MWD, Using 6MWD as the primary assessment of patients' perioperative functional status and the primary endpoint of the study, patients were evaluated at enrollment, before surgery, and 30 days after surgery, respectively., About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery
Length of hospitalization, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|postoperative complication, 30 days after surgery|pulmonary function, FVC, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|pulmonary function, FEV1, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|pulmonary function, FEV1/FVC, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|pulmonary function, MVV, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|grip, Using grip dynamometer to measure the grip strength of the patient's hand, measured in kg, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|NRS2002 Nutritional Risk Screening, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale（HADS）, There are 14 questions in total, with four options for each question ranging from 0 to 3；0 to 7 indicating no symptoms, 8 to 10 indicating suspected anxiety or depression symptoms, and 11 to 21 indicating certain symptoms, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|Quality of Recovery-15（QOR-15）, A total of 15 questions, each question have 0-10 points, the higher the score means the better the recovery effect, About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery|World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0（WHODAS 2.0）, Questions are on a scale of 1-5, with a lower score indicating that the patient is generally better., About 2-4 month before surgery(When deciding on surgery), 1 day before surgery, 30 days after surgery
