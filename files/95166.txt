Phase 2 Trial of Epcoritamab in Combination With Rituximab-mini CVP for Older Unfit/Frail Patients or Anthracycline-Ineligible Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
To learn if adding epcoritamab to the treatment combination R-miniCVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) can help to control newly diagnosed DLBCL. The safety of this combination will also be studied.
Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Epcoritamab
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion: an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

--To determine the efficacy of epcoritamab in combination with R-miniCVP as determined by CR rate after six cycles of combination treatment for elderly/unfit patients or patients with heart failure with previously untreated DLBCL.

Secondary Objectives

--To determine best overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and evaluation of safety of epcoritamab in combination with R-miniCVP as treatment for elderly/unfit patients or patients with heart failure with previously untreated DLBCL.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To determine the biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance to epcoritamab in combination with R-miniCVP in DLBCL.
* To determine the quality of life in patients with DLBCL receiving epcoritamab in combination with R-miniCVP
