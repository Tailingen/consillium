Methylphenidate in Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors With Cancer-related Fatigue
Cancer-related fatigue is a common and debilitating late effect in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Currently, evidence-based recommendations to ameliorate this condition are lacking.

The researchers will investigate the ability of methylphenidate to improve fatigue and cognition in pediatric brain tumor survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue. Methylphenidate is a drug (central nervous stimulant) most commonly used in the treatment of hyperkinetic disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

If methylphenidate shows an effect, the prospects are important for this patient group, since methylphenidate may then be included as part of the treatment of brain tumor-related fatigue.
