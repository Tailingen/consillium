A Phase II Study of AT7519M, a CDK Inhibitor, in Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug AT7519M has on chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: AT7519M
Objective Response Rate, Efficacy (as assessed by objective response rate) of AT7519M when given as a 1 hour intravenous infusion twice weekly for two out of three weeks in patients with relapsed and/or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia., 24 months
Toxicity severity, 24 months|Time to progression, 24 months|Response duration, 24 months
This research is being done because AT7519M has been shown to shrink tumours in animals, has been studied in a few people and seems promising, but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment.
