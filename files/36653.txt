BIOLOGICAL: Nivestim®
Safety of Nivestim® to reduce or prevent febrile neutropenia in patients treated with neutropenia-inducing chemotherapy for a malignant disease, solid tumor or a malignant hemopathy., The safety will be assessed by the record of all treatment emergent adverse events and all data about hospitalization due to any febrile neutropenia or infection., Each patient will be followed for the duration of his chemotherapy regimen (the current one at the time of the Nivestim® treatment initiation) up to a maximum of six months
Efficacy of treatment with Nivestim®, Assess the efficacy of the treatment with Nivestim® by studying occurrence of febrile neutropenia, infection and the impact of these events on the chemotherapy treatment (cycle postponement, dose reduction), Each patient will be followed for the duration of his chemotherapy regimen (the current one at the time of the Nivestim® treatment initiation) up to a maximum of six months|Characteristics of the patients treated with Nivestim® in real-life practice, Describe the characteristics of the patients treated with Nivestim® in real-life practice,, At Visit 1|Methods of treatment with Nivestim®, Describe the methods of treatment with Nivestim® depending on the indications (curative or prophylactic) in routine practice., Each patient will be followed for the duration of his chemotherapy regimen (the current one at the time of the Nivestim® treatment initiation) up to a maximum of six months|Profiles of the physicians participating in the study, Describe the profiles of the physicians participating in the study, At visit 1|General practice of these physicians with regard to prescription of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factors (G-CSF), Assess the general practice of these physicians with regard to prescription of G-CSF, At visit 1
