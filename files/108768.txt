99mTc Labelled Affibody SPECT/CT Imaging for Breast Cancer HER2 Characterization
This is an open-label single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 99mTc-ABH2 in breast cancer patients. A single dose of 370Â±54 Mega-Becquerel (MBq)99mTc-ABH2 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the SPECT/CT images.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: 99mTc-ABH2
T/B, Target/Background ratio of 99mTc-ABH2 SPECT/CT in Diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer, 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients will be followed and assessed, 1 week
99mTc-ABH2 is an affibody probe targeting HER2. The investigators will determine the use of 99mTc-ABH2 SPECT/CT in the detection of HER2-positive breast cancer, and to compare its diagnostic value with routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) pathological staining. HER2 imaging, specifically to HER2 receptor expressed on malignant breast cancer cell surface, might help for targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody such as trastuzumab in breast cancer, and may improve the treatment strategy of breast cancer. The investigator will determine the use of 99mTc-ABH2 SPECT/CT in stratifying breast cancer.
