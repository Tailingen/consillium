A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Indian Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Prior Treatment With Trastuzumab and a Taxane
This is a Phase IV, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the safety of trastuzumab emtansine in Indian patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer, Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine
Severity of Adverse Events, Adverse events (AEs) grading was completed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during the study were also considered as adverse events., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAEs were defined as any AE that fulfilled any of the following criteria: fatal (resulted in death), life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, was medically significant or required intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed here., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Severity of SAEs as Per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.03, Severity refered to the intensity of an AE (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest, Non-serious AEs of special interest included cases of severe drug-induced liver injury and suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Laboratory Results Abnormalities, From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Medication, From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Modification of Study Medication, From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Interruption of Study Medication, From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Exposure to Study Drug, Exposure to study drug was the amount of study drug received over time (weeks)., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Drug-Induced Liver Injury Meeting Hy's Law Criteria, Hy's law criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury included elevated aminotransferase enzymes (ALT/AST) with concurrent elevated serum total bilirubin, gross jaundice, clinical disability and the need for hospital care., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Congestive Heart Failure, From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as Measured by Echocardiogram, From baseline to every three cycles of treatment up to Cycle 39 Day 1, and at the 2-days post-treatment, safety follow-up visits 1 and 3|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was based on the best (confirmed) overall response (BOR). ORR was defined as the number (%) of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) where the confirmation was performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression of disease or the date of death (by any cause in the absence of progression) whichever occurred first., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of death due to any cause. Participants not known to have died at the time of final analysis were censored based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive., From cycle 1 up to approximately 3 years
