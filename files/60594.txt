MR-simulation in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer
To assess the feasibility of acquiring an MR scan in the radiotherapy treatment position as part of the patient's radiotherapy pathway and incorporating the data into our radiotherapy planning systems, so that it can be potentially used to reduce healthy tissue exposure to radiation. Subsequently, the protocols and procedures established can be used to put the technique into routine clinical practice.

DEVICE: MRI scan
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MRI-simulation for prostate patients, Write a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for MRI-scanning of prostate patients in the radiotherapy treatment position so that their data can be used in the treatment planning for either in-direct or MRI-only planning, 6 months
Clinical Protocol for in-direct MRI planning for prostate, Write a clinical protocol for "in-direct" MRI planning of prostate external beam radiotherapy, whereby MRI data is used to define anatomical structures and these are translated onto the co-registered CT scan for treatment planning, 6 months|Clinical Protocol for direct MRI-only planning for prostate, Write a clinical protocol for "direct" MRI-only planning of prostate external beam radiotherapy, whereby MRI data is used to define anatomical structures and also for dose calculation and setup verification, 18 months
Conventional radiotherapy treatment planning uses computed tomography (CT) scans to provide an accurate 3-D picture of the local anatomy. This helps the planners to maximise the radiation dose delivered to the prostate, whilst minimising the dose to surrounding normal tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is an established diagnostic imaging technique that provides even clearer images of the local anatomy. However, until recently the technology hasn't existed to allow us to perform MRI scans with patients "set-up" in the position required to plan and deliver radiotherapy to the prostate. This study is being performed to assess methods that may allow us to incorporate MRI scans into the radiotherapy planning process, which may further increase the accuracy of the treatment, reducing the irradiation of surrounding normal tissue and minimising toxicity.
