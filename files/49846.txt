Phase I Study of TAK-701 in Adult Patients With Advanced Nonhematological Malignancies
This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 study of TAK 701 in adult patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to administer TAK 701 to humans. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics profile of TAK-701.
