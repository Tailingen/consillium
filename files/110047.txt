A Dose-escalation Study in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This is an open label, dose escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to determine if INCB024360 (study drug) is safe, well-tolerated and effective in patients with advanced malignancies. Patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of three and each observed a minimum of 28 days before the next group is enrolled and may begin to receive study drug. For subject safety, the first subject in each cohort will be administered drug for one week before the next two subjects in the cohort can begin drug administration. Doses will be escalated unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in one of three subjects.

An expanded cohort of up to 15 patients may be recruited to further explore safety at the 'maximum tolerated dose' or at a lower, pharmacologically active, dose.
Solid Tumors and Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: INCB024360
Safety and tolerability as measured by adverse events and dose limiting toxicities, Measured from baseline through follow-up period (measured during cycle 1 weekly and bi monthly thereafter)
Tumor assessment as measured by RECIST criteria, Measured from baseline through treatment cessation. (Measured every other cycle and end of study)|Measurement of IDO inhibition in whole blood measured through blood sampling., Cycle 1, Day 1 and each 28 day subsequent cycle at Day 1|PK analysis, Full PK at Days 1, 8 (trough only), 15 at Cycle 1 and trough at each subsequent cycle at Day 1
