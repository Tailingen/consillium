Efficacy and Safety of TQB2450 Injection Combined With Chemotherapy ± Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules for Advanced Endometrial Cancer or Sarcoma of Uterus.
This study plans to enroll 69 subjects of endometrial cancer and 5-10 subjects of sarcoma of uterus. The experimental set is divided into lead-in trial and formal trial. The lead-in trial includes 9 subjects to observe the safety of the combination and determine the dosage of anlotinib dihydrochloride capsules before the formal phase.

The formal trial includes 60 subjects of endometrial cancer and 5-10 subjects of sarcoma of uterus. The purpose is to evaluate efficacy and safety of TQB2450 injection combined with chemotherapy ± anlotinib hydrochloride capsules for first-line treatment and maintenance treatment of patient with advanced endometrial cancer or sarcoma of uterus, and explore biomarkers related to efficacy, mechanism of action, safety and/or pathological mechanisms, the surgical conversion rate. ORR is the primary endpoint.

Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and maintained for a certain period of time, including cases with complete remission and partial remission, Through study completion, an average of 24 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression refers to tumor growth, or the metastasis of primary tumor lesions, or the discovery of new lesions, etc., From data of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the time of death of death from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of Remission (DOR), The period from the first judgment of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to the discovery of disease progression (PD)., The length of time the patient received this regimen to keep the tumor shrinking, through study completion, an average of 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period of time, including complete remission (CR, Complete Response), partial remission (PR, Partial Response) and stable (SD, stable Disease) cases, Through study completion, an average of 24 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), The occurrence of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs)., Baseline to other antitumor therapy, through study completion, an average of 24 months|Abnormal laboratory test indicators, The incidence of abnormal laboratory test indicators of participants by attachment 1 in the test protocol., Baseline to other antitumor therapy, through study completion, an average of 24 months|The surgical conversion rate, The proportion of subjects who meet the criteria and undergo radical resection surgery., Baseline to other antitumor therapy, through study completion, an average of 24 months
