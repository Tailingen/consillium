A Study of Blood Pressure Control During Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study to find out whether an intensive approach to treating high blood pressure during breast cancer treatment is safe and more effective than standard blood pressure treatment at lowering blood pressure levels and the risk of cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer. Other studies have shown lowering blood pressure improves the health of patients. However, these studies have not included people with cancer.

The PROTECT trial is testing a treatment strategy regarding intensive versus standard SBP goals, and is not testing specific medications.
