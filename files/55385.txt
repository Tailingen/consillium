Iressa Follow-up Trial
The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety profile and the secondary objective to estimate clinical benefit of ZD1839 (gefitinib).
Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gefitinib
Number of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Assessment of the long-term safety profile of ZD1839 therapy by assessing the incidence of adverse events. Any adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring during treatment and any SAEs occurring within 30 days after stopping the trial drug must be followed to resolution unless, in the investigator's opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve because of the patient's underlying disease, Serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs were collected from the start of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or 30 days after last visit (up to approximately 120 months)|Number of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Related to ZD1839, Assessment of the long-term safety profile of ZD1839 therapy by assessing the incidence of adverse events.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Objective disease progressing was assessed using the previous cancer response criteria in the parent ZD1839 trial: ie Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) tumor response criteria, as a 50% increase or an increase of 10 cm2 (whichever is smaller) in the sum of products of all measurable lesions from the overall smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) using the same techniques as baseline; Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase In the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From randomization until progression or death (up to 120 months)|Overall Survival (OS), From randomization until death (up to 120 months)
The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety profile and the secondary objective to estimate clinical benefit of ZD1839 (gefitinib).
