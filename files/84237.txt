A Novel Sequential Treatment of Salvage and Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Chemotherapy for Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation (SCT) for Primary Refractory and Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
This open-label Phase I study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for CPX-351 followed by a reduced intensity conditioning regimen and incorporates a dose-escalation schedule that sequentially enrolls 6 dosing cohorts. After the determination of the MTD, the investigator reserves the option to enroll up to 10 additional subjects in an expanded safety cohort(s) at the MTD.

Refractory and relapsed AML patients who meet standard institutional criteria to undergo sequential induction/reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic transplants will be offered a transplant from a related or unrelated donor (full match or 1 antigen mismatch). Cord blood transplants will not be used in this study.
