Real-world Study on Shenbailing Granules for Improving Qi and Blood Deficiency in Patients After Breast Cancer Surgery
This study aims to explore the clinical efficacy of Shenbailing granules in improving quality of life and reducing cancer-related fatigue in a real-world setting, with the goal of providing clinical evidence for the use of Shenbailing granules in alleviating cancer-related fatigue among post-breast cancer surgery patients.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Shenbailing
Piper Fatigue Assessment score, The degree of cancer fatigue was assessed by piper Fatigue Assessment Scale, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days postoperatively
EORTC QLQ-C30 score, Measure the quality of life of cancer patients in different physical and psychological aspects, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days postoperatively|EORTC QLQ-BR23 score, Evaluate systemic treatment side effects, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, body image, and sexual function, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days postoperatively
This study plans to enroll patients who have undergone breast cancer surgery. The experimental group will receive Shenbailing granule therapy, with the primary objective of exploring the improvement of postoperative cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in breast cancer patients treated with Shenbailing granules. Patients will enter the real-world study phase immediately after surgery.

Experimental group: Adjuvant therapy with Shenbailing granules, starting from 1 day after surgery; Control group: Normal postoperative recovery without medication.

After confirming the surgery date, patients' quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, and breast cancer patient-reported outcome scales will be collected preoperatively, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days postoperatively to evaluate their quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. If patients are not tolerant to the medication, they will stop taking it.
