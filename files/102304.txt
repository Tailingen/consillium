Omitting Biopsy of SEntinel Lymph Node With Radiation After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer (OBSERB) Trial
The OBSERB study is a multi-center, non-blinded, pragmatic, parallel, randomized controlled trial in which patients with cT1-3N1 and ycN0 breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasm Female|Lymphatic Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Radiotherapy
Disease-free survival, Disease free survival including breast, axilla and other organs from medical record, 5 years
Local recurrence, Ipsilateral breast from medical record, 5 years|Axillary recurrence, Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes from medical record, 5 years|distant recurrence, Other organs except ipsilateral breast and axillary lymph nodes from medical record, 5 years|distant free survival, No disease on other organs except ipsilateral breast and axillary lymph nodes from medical record, 5 years|Overall survival, Overall survival from medical record, 5 years
Quality of life by questionnaire, Pain, Discomfort, Numbness, Rotation of arm, Lymphedema of arm, 5 years
The OBSERB study aims to compare the oncologic outcomes of radiotherapy without sentinel lymph node biopsy versus sentinel lymph node biopsy for the management of breast cancer which showed the cN1 was conversed as ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

To verify whether, the radiotherapy without SLN can be applied, when the cN1 was conversed as ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

To verify whether, the additional treatment decision can be established based on only the biology of primary tumor without the pathologic information of axillary lymph nodes To verify whether, the patients' quality of life can be improved by a less invasive surgical procedure, when the cN1 was conversed as ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
