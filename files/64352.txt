Efficacy of RUS GA Surgical Navigation for Robot-assisted Distal Gastrectomy in Gastric Cancer Patients
This investigator-initiated, randomized superiority clinical trial aims to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of RUS GA Surgical Navigation, an endoscopic imaging treatment planning software, in patients undergoing robotic-assisted distal gastric cancer surgery. The trial will compare the experimental group using RUS GA with a control group, aiming to show an 8.7% reduction in total surgery duration. The study will involve global multicenter patient recruitment and evaluate the clinical safety and feasibility of the software, which has been shown to be reliable in previous studies.

* Investigational Medical Device: RUS GA (Endoscopic Imaging Treatment Planning Software, E04010.01)
* Clinical Trial duration: 30 months from IRB approval -Target number of subjects: Total of 330 participants
Gastric Cancer
DEVICE: RUS GA|PROCEDURE: standard treatment
Surgery duration, To assess whether the use of the endoscopic imaging treatment planning software, RUS GA, in actual surgeries of patients with gastric cancer results in a statistically significant reduction in total surgical time compared to surgeries conducted without the use of RUS GA., during surgery(Record anesthesia time, total operation time, and robot console time separately)
After selecting subjects and obtaining informed consent, randomization will be conducted. Robot-assisted gastrectomy will be performed using RUS GA or without software. Clinical significance will be evaluated through outpatient follow -ups for up to one month after discharge.
