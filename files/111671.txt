Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin for Advanced NSCLC Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
A phase III trial has demonstrated that in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cisplatin/ pemetrexed provides similar efficacy with better tolerability and more convenient administration than cisplatin/gemcitabine. Moreover,this trial showed survival differences based on histologic type. The investigators want to research some biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes.
