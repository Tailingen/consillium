Efficacy and Safety of Nab-Paclitaxel Plus S-1 in the First-line Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy of digestive system with gradually increasing incidence, is the fourth and seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world (1) and China (2) according to the statistics in 2014. The vast majority of patients were confirmed as locally advanced or distantly metastatic disease at diagnosis with an estimated five-year survival rate of 4% (3) due to occlusive development and rapid progress. Advanced pancreatic cancer is characterized by poor prognosis.
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel and S-1
Objective response rate（ORR）, CR+PR was defined as objective response rate (ORR), 6 month
DCR, CR+PR+SD was defined as disease control rate (DCR), 6 month|PFS, From date of randomization until date of first documented PD, date of death, 6 month|OS, From date of randomization until date of death, 1 year|Safety profile: Adverse events of nab-Paclitaxel plus S-1 for advanced pancreatic cancer, Adverse events of nab-Paclitaxel plus S-1 for advanced pancreatic cancer, 1 year
Gemcitabine has been approved as the standard chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer since 1996, but the efficacy is extremely limited by a response rate of 6-8%, and median survival of 5.5-7 months. However, Gemcitabine-based combination treatments fail to transcend GEM monotherapy on overall survival, including GEM + 5-Fu \[10\], GEM + Oxaliplatin\[11\], and GEM + Irinotecan \[12\] and GEM + Cisplatin \[13\] (7-8) . Until 2011, Conroy et al.\[15\] reported that FOLFIRINOX solutions significantly improved ORR (31.6% vs 9%, P=0.0008), PFS (6.4 vs. 3.3 months, P\<0.0001) and OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months, P\<0.001) than GEM single-agent, but the significant increase of grade 3/4 adverse reactions, to some extent, limited its wide application. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore effective and safe chemotherapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Nab-Paclitaxel was approved by FDA for advanced pancreatic cancer in September 2013. S-1 has demonstrated potential value in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer as a new compound oral 5-FU(4-5) and has been approved for pancreatic cancer treatment in Japan.

We conducted a single arm, prospective, phase II study in our center on the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with nab-Paclitaxel and S-1 to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen.
