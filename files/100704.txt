The Role of Central Neck Dissection in Stage N0 Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
The benefits of prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) remain controversial in clinically node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This study main goal is to investigate benefits of prophylactic central neck dissection in clinically node-negative papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Papillary Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: central neck dissection
the incidence metastatic lymph node in patients with clinically node-negative thyroid carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection, numbers of positive histopathological lymph node biopsies postoperative, 12 months
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Recurrence rate is still high. The standard management is total thyroidectomy. regional lymph node metastasis is noted in recurrent cases. Some studies stated benefits of central neck dissection in orevention of recurrence and others said there is no benefits. so prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) remain controversial in clinically node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
