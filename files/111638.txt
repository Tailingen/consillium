A Study of PRT1419 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to define the dosing schedule, maximally tolerated dose and/or estimate the optimal biological dose to be used in subsequent development of PRT1419.
Sarcoma|Melanoma|Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Cervical Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: PRT1419
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PRT1419, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the first cycle, Baseline through Day 28|Maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and/or optimal biological dose (OBD), The MTD and/or OBD will be established for further investigation in participants with advanced solid tumors., Baseline through approximately 2 years|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of PRT1419, The RP2D will be established for further investigation in participants with advanced solid tumors., Baseline through approximately 2 years
Safety and tolerability of PRT1419: AEs, SAEs, CTCAE assessments, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Baseline through approximately 2 years|Pharmacokinetic profile of PRT1419: maximum observed plasma concentration, PRT1419 pharmacokinetics will be calculated including the maximum observed plasma concentration, Baseline through approximately 2 years|Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419: measurement of objective responses, Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 will be based on the measurement of objective responses, Baseline through approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival will be calculated from the first administration of PRT1419 until death or until the criteria for disease progression are met, Baseline through approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1 inhibitor, evaluating patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including breast, lung, sarcoma and melanoma as part of a 28-day treatment cycle. The study will employ a "3+3" dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is identified.
