The Prognosis Effect of Indocyanine Green (ICG) Fluorescence Guided Surgery on Disease-free Survival (DFS) of Stage III Colorectal Cancer
Previous studies of Indocyanine green (ICG) in colorectal surgery have focused on lymphatic mapping, lymph node detection, and the number of harvested lymph nodes. However, relatively few studies have evaluated the outcomes of this imaging technology, especially the prognosis following of colorectal cancer resection. The present study assessed the prognosis of stage III colorectal cancer patients following ICG fluorescence-guided surgery as compared to conventional surgery without the use of ICG Fluorescence imaging
Colorectal Cancer Stage III
PROCEDURE: ICG lymphangiography procedure
Disease-free survival (DFS) rate, the rate of of no recurrence or metastasis after 3 years from radical surgery, From radical surgery to the end of follow-up ,up to 36 months
the number of harvested lymph nodes, the number of harvested lymph nodes of radical surgery, From radical surgery to the end of perioperative period at 1 month|Postoperative complications, Postoperative complications ICG-related complications, surgery-related complications, and systemic complications. Postoperative complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo system, From radical surgery to the end of perioperative period at 1 month|Overall survival rate, the rate of 3 years overall survival after radical surgery, From radical surgery to the end of follow-up ,up to 36 months
